unification.178.t: "[GetNewspaper]Bielsko-Biała unifies Podhale!"
unification.178.desc: "In a predictable but somewhat mundane turn of events, Bielsko-Biała has claimed dominion over the miserable piece of Carpathian Mountains known as Podhale. This triumph was brought over either by the last sliver of sanity left over in the rump city-state, or some kind of Euroliberal support. Historians will make sense of it, as they always do. \n\nThe wounds of the brotherly war in the region won’t heal easily, especially for a city that has suffered some decline even before the Fall. Various speculations are made about future developments in the reborn republic, concerning rebuilding textile industry or expansion of the hydroelectric network. It is certain, however, that the new government prefers reconstruction, stability and defence over expansion, and for a while, peace may actually last."
unification.178.a: "A moment of respite?"
