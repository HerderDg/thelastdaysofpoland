 ##Characters##
POLITICS_ANDRZEJ_SAPKOWSKI_DESC:0 "Andrzej Sapkowski (born 21 June 1948) - A popular writer, best known for his "Witcher" book series. After the collapse of Polish state he gathered loyal fans and fouded his own faction in the city of Skierniewice mainly as a way of protecting himself in these chaotic times. To keep morale of fantasy fanatics up, he decided to stylise his faction in an image of the Witcher world he created. At least that's what the cynics say, as it is also possible that the old writer has gone compeletely mad and his duchy is not a mere masquerade, but a genuine attempt to create a truly Temerian realm. Truth may never be revealed as the "duke" rarely speaks in public and when he does his ellusive answers and dry sense of humor make it really hard to figure out what's actually on his mind."
POLITICS_JACEK_BARTYZEL_DESC:0 "Jacek Bartyzel (born 16 January 1956) - A publicist, social activist and a professor at university known for his radical conservatism and advocacy for monarchism. He tried to create his own catholic monarical state in Łowicz, but failed to become one of the key players in the region due to lack of popularity of his ideas. Situation got worse for him, when Andrzej Sapkowski arrived in the area. Thee writer gained wide support thanks to his fame, while the number of Bartyzel's supporters was dwindling every day. Realising, his faction won't survive on his own, he sweared fealty to duke Sapkowski, promising his faithful service in exchange for the autonomous rule of newly formed county of Łowicz. Even though he views the Duchy of Velen as a farse, he can't deny that Sapkowski's regime is the only monarchical government, that gained traction in the lands of post-Fall Łódź provine and because of that, he will work with Sapkowski as long as the duke respects his right to autonomous rule."
POLITICS_WLADYSLAW_BARTYZEL_DESC:0 "Władysław V Bartyzel (born as Jacek Władysław Bartyzel) - After much deliberation, the regency council, presided by his father, has chosen Jacek Władysław as a new king of Poland. While he had his disagreements with his father in certain political matters, he nevertheless offered him his help in governing the county of Łowicz and later he kept public support at high levels during his father's rebellion. He may not be as conservative as carlist candindate for the throne, he's much more safer option, as he's already well versed in warlord politics and can actually speak Polish."
POLITICS_KAROL_BURBON_DESC:0 "Karol Ksawery Burbon-Parmeński - (born 27 January 1970) - The current head of the House of Bourbon-Parma, as well a member of the Dutch Royal Family. He is the claimant to the defunct throne of the extinct Duchy of Parma. In addition, he is considered by some a contested pretender to the Carlist claim to the throne of Spain under the name Carlos Javier I.  While he had never contested the legitimacy of the Burbon line currently ruling in Spain, he decided to accept the offer of Legitimist Regency Council of Poland and become a new king of soon-to-be unified kingdom. While he's not uccostomed to brutal reality of post-Fall Poland and can't communicate with his subject due to his unfamiliarity with local language, his rise to power is believed to be the only for truly virtuous government in the Polish lands."
