sapek.1.t:0 "His Highness, the Delirious"
sapek.1.desc:0 "In the year of our Lord 2025 the world did not end. Even though many things indicated it will. Men became wolves to one another, and great calamities have fallen upon them. The Wormwood Star fell from the heavens and poisoned a third of the land and of the waters. \n\nBut it was fun anyway. \n\nAndrzej Sapkowski stood up and adjusted the map on the wall of his „innermost private ducal chamber”, that is, the toilet. The parchment was torn and bleaked from constant redrawing and erasing of borders between warlords, up to a point when the duke simply moved it to a place more appropriate. The lines and labels have changed so many times Sapkowski considered whether not to simply wrap up the worn out Poland and flush it down. It soon will be yet another work of fiction. \n\nTruth be told, that's how everything seemed recently. As if the fate of Poland fell into hands of a whole bunch of terrible writers, spitting out pages and pages of their kitschy, badly-written political and ideological fantasies. Naturally you shouldn’t blame people for retreating into fiction when things go south, but there’s escapism and then there are warlords. It’s not an issue that people die in the name of fiction – they’ve done it a lot – but let it be a good fiction, at least. \n\nThus, the Duke wrangled his fame and contacts, and voila – Ellander was born. Its mother was self-preservation, while lust of power and money was the father paying regular alimony. Not the worst place to be, until someone – in this case synonymous with anyone – comes knocking with a real army. \n\nBut for now – Sapkowski thought while washing hands – let the people enjoy the moment. Let them be glad they’re living in a fantasy or just still living, whatever. The storm has yet to begin."

sapek.2.t:0 "Echoes of Yesterday"
sapek.2.desc:0 "– Oh, Lord, your ways are strange indeed – muttered, praying, Jacek Bartyzel. His whispers echoed through the dome of the church, audible only to God and His Mother, as Bartyzel ordered to make the temple a restricted zone while he was conversing with the Almighty about the precarious situation he found himself in. \n\nMonarchy is, as every Catholic should know, the God-ordained form of government. It is the only barrier reliable enough to defend against moral corruption and communism. That is what Bartyzel believed, although during his years in PRL and the III Republic he witnessed how monarchic ideas faded even further into oblivion and he even began thinking the cause might be lost. But God took notice and sent calamities and Anarchy as a divine punishment reminding of the right way. A problem appeared, however – no legitimate pretender would be willing in their right mind to devote themself to a broken country. Where should the monarch come from, then? Indecisive and isolated, the monarchists made a bid for power, but they quickly found out they’ve bitten off more than they could chew. \n\nSapkowski’s rise to power reminded Bartyzel of the legends told about barbarian kings from the dawn of Christian Europe. True, he’s quite godless, and many of his supporters are outright blasphemous, but have things like that stopped the Word of God for long? Bartyzel put his pride on a shelf and offered his support to the Duke. This proved a deciding factor in stabilizing the realm and keeping its borders safe. \n\nIn time the ways of the Lord will straighten. Meanwhile, Bartyzel hones his supporters into an effective, loyal and zealous paramilitary, ready to uphold the tradition of true monarchism. Conventionally named the Order of the White Rose, it has become a home for all those sympathizing with the right. For now Bartyzel, as the Grandmaster of the Order, still has to tread carefully, but when the time is right, he might be strong enough to present the throne as an offering to a more respectable, worthy and virtuous monarch. \n\n– So help me God –  he concluded, rising from the church floor and heading towards the exit."

They are a disorganized mob, and either we deal with them like one should with brigands, or they’ll act like the ones in our lands. \nSome of the council members whispered angrily. This will anger our subjects, they said. Piekara prepared for a response, but Ziemiański interrupted him. \n– It’s better not to make any enemies just as our reign has solidified. Maribor fights with gold, and that weapon will prove deadly to us, if we engage our forces carelessly. \n\n – When it comes to my opinion – Sapkowski leaned over the map – I am concerned with what happens in Wyzima. They’ve elected a „king” from among their own. This city is lawless, and ripe with crime, debauchery and whoring. We can’t leave our capital in that state. \n– These are the words of wisdom, my liege! – Bartyzel proclaimed, as his supporters clapped and nodded in an overtly enthusiastic manner. – We surely could find an ally in the Brotherhood of Bełcha... I mean Mahakam. I can reach out to them for aid. \n\n – Let us not reveal that we’re the first ones asking for help – Sapkowski replied. – For now, all I wanted is to know your opinion, and with that knowledge I’ll take a bit of time to ponder over – his  face grimaced as if he was mocking someone – our politics. But you, sir Jacek – he nodded to Dukaj – you haven’t voiced your opinion yet. \n– I don’t think there’s any point in seeking conflict now, my liege. It’s going to find us soon enough."

sapek.4.desc:0 "The explosion shattered the west fence at 23:17. Panic ensued, and while guards rallied to the site of explosion, the northern gate was bombed with handgranades. Mutilated guards were finished off with short knives. A band of men armed with submachine guns and grenades broke through into the facility. \n\nThe Director (formally addressed as „master wizard potioner to the Duke”) tried to contact the city constable immediately, but the signal was jammed. The constabulary was put on alert immediately after the explosion was heard, but just a few minutes later the town square was filled with the rattle of machine guns. A few high-speed, pocket-size technicals have broken into the city, aiming at windows and passersby and throwing grenades through broken glass. The constable, fearing this is an attempt on the Duke’s life, sent a large detachment to guard the ducal palace, ordering the rest to block the streets and attempt to surround the technicals. \n\nMeanwhile, the facility burned. The attackers showered disoriented guards with furious fire, spreading sheer terror through the premises. While they fought, another detachment of technicals rode through the western breach, aiming straight for the laboratories and warehouses. Men clad in balaclavas got off them and in a blink of an eye reached the most coveted secrets of Duchy’s wizards. Overwhelming the few remaining guards, they begun lading technicals with testing vials, newly-devised concoctions and strongboxes containing the recipes. \n\nJust as the Director tried to make one more call, one of the raiders broke into his room and stabbed his back, howling stridently in bloody rage. The wizard fell to the floor, seeing as the fiery glow overtook the sky behind the windows. Screams, both frenzied and terrified along with thunderous explosions came from the city."

Those who did, ran out of the town faster than Jaskier when it turned out his seductive elven maiden was actually a crossdresser. The crowd making itself scarce was the worst of it all: Many figured they'd pack up their things. Enough of their carts could clog up the streets, which would pose trouble for city guard out to get the fire under control. Of course, with most fire engines out of commission, the limited guards and the military were understength. Priorities had to be made: Many a brother was seen in burning church, or stables, and had to be saved, him and the horses. But then again, the government castle was imperiled as well, along the most precious mana of all: The political mana, without which the Director could cast none of his edicts.

Unless they remembered to refrigerate it; with them, you never knew, they'd have blown up little more than fertilizer. \n 'Łowicz town hall, where token reception was lost. Our Łowicz admin center was relocated to the local church ruin the whole time. The Inquisitor figured he could interrogate people more conveniently if the governing organ was out of sight. We almost caught a would-be saboteur at Rawa, but our guard swore he was a colored, tattooed man who went through the portal. We had him whipped for drinking on the job, naturally.' \n 'That's it?' - Sapkowski asked with weary voice. \n 'They... blew up our experimental potions. Bulk of our research is in Rawa, but project Selkimore and project Blueberry are... where the devil says goodnight.' Then they went on about human casualties, but Sapkowski's ears checked out already. His thoughts were a tornado that swept the clowns around him away, and he and his plans were in its eye. In full serenity, he complentated his plan to make his monster slayers real. The setback in form of these terror strikes? Minimal. These two were backup projects, entirely replacable.

We looked everywhere a salamander could hide in: Damp creeks, tanning beds, these reptiles just can't be found.' \n Sapkowski went red like when he asked CDP Red for his money back per Law of Surprise (right?), got a whole barrel of vodka instead and next thing he knew he was brewing a new deal with that nice lady from Netflix. \n 'Amphibians' - he muttered. \n '...the fuck?' - the PFI vanguard was clearly off guard as he let his boorish default speech into the radio - 'I mean, pardon me m'lord?' \n 'SALAMANDERS ARE AMPHIBIANS.' - he screamed and cut off the connection, slamming the telephone. Never again should he call saboteurs names, not while his army is made up of mental patients. Ill, deficient? No matter.

What's this place like, is on crossroads, yet to define itself. Small wonder the smallfolk is confused at best.' \n Sapkowski pontificated the truths, the few truths that truly could be called facts these days, and the council listened. \n 'We do what we pivoted towards, consolidate money and power within our knightly and state class, and our people will be just like the peasants as we've envisioned. Simple and strong. Or, we let them work for themselves. To the peasant, the farm. To the merchant, freedom.

This is definitely the end of his adventures.\n"Scoia'tael," the thought flashed through his mind despite the terrible pain. - "But what would a commando do so far from Kaer Nevitz?" - The answer came faster than he expected - in the form of a huge pine cone that hit him on the head and knocked him unconscious.\n\nScouts dressed in improvised ghillie suits emerged from the woods, walking slowly like hunters after prey. With one efficient movement they caught up with a still breathing but blacked out soldier and tied him up, stuffing him into a sleeping bag. He woke up as they threw him violently to the ground. They were somewhere else entirely, near some river. Around him stood four scouts with lilies pinned to their chests. Their expressions burned with hatred, but none of them was holding a weapon.\n"If only I could get up, I could run for it." - thought the prisoner, but he couldn't even stay on his feet because his knee refused to obey.\nOne of them, wearing a wide hat, appeared to be a captain. He was the one, who addressed an important message to the prisoner:\n- On behalf of Polish Scouts, I sentence you to death for betraying the Homeland!\nUnlucky Ellander soldier was stuffed back into the sleeping bag and the sleeping bag was thrown into the river.

His plan to use the remaining infrastructure, which would lead to the creation of artificial lakes in the area in the future, turned out to be a hit, and the perfect solution to the issue of leadership of the Brotherhood.\n- All ready, my Duke. We can start.\n- Wonderful. And thus shall fall those who today have called themselves mighty over all. No one will ever mention them again. Let every realm know what will happen when they defy my will! DROWN THEM!\n\nNot everyone understood the consequences of this order. Cisterns, pipes and channels were redirected towards the great depths of Bełchatów in the caves where the last coal knights were located. At the end of the day, however, no monsters in steel armor surfaced. Instead, the corpses of dignitaries, officials, and their families drifted on the dark slab of the newly formed lake. Some could say the saw bodies of the Elder Council somewhere on the western bank. But it didn't matter.

Few of them, however, match the new masters of Łódź in their oddity. \nAndrzej Sapkowski's clique (or kingdom, as it calls itself) has managed to win the people's hearts with its Witcher-themed aesthetics and united all of Łódź, referring to the voivodeship as Temeria. The kingdom's state structure has been described by local and international observers as a "Disneyland-state", using names and references to the Witcher franchise as a way to push its social liberal agenda. The clique was able to succeed thanks to an alliance with Jacek Bartyzel's Carlists, who took a liking to Sapkowski's "monarchy". Other statelets surrounding Łódź, who so far have thought of Temeria as of an interesting, albeit doomed to fail experiment, now watch it in concern, wondering if this Witcher LARP will be convincing enough for the Carlists, and whether it wasn't a little bit *too* convincing for Sapkowski himself."

Calling it Vizima (after the capital of Temeria), he and his militias started riots on Piotrkowska Street, which quickly turned into a regular battle with police units. Unfortunately, the mob led by one of his devoted friends scattered at the mere sight of the armed policemen. For this disobedience, he had to flee Vizima, although in truth he was banished from it. He settled in the deserted Skierniewice, which he renamed Kaer Nevitz. Others joined him shortly after, but some, like his commander in chief, were out of luck.

I can't talk too loud about it though. With these fanatics in power, the future is not very colorful. And certainly not in the color of the rainbow.\n\nFirst they will come for the elves, then for the dwarves, gnomes, and dopplers. Perhaps they will even take on wizards. Artists will also be taken.

You should have seen them dash on their horses, how they fire their bows! This is pure poetry in military form! Admittedly, they don't really like being watched, they shouted something at me, so it must have been secret training. It sounded like - 'BLOEDE DHOINE' or something similar.

But there is a training plan, there are prospects for the headquarters, it just might be successful.\n\nOne thing. Witchers are monster slayers. I've always suspected that that old woman upstairs is a grave hag, and that creepy clerk from the ground floor must be a vampire ... but I'm not entirely sure if we'll find any ghouls, kikimores or wyverns here...\n\nSo what monsters are they going to hunt?"

The witchers will finally be able to hunt real monsters, after all, they were trained to do so.\n\nRutkowski's elitistically trained and equipped units will be the biggest problem.

SAP_pesky_landsknechts_desc:0 "Grand Commander Rutkowski was one of the last to capitulate. His troops fought very bravely and caused our soldiers a lot of problems. Our Chief Sapkowski also noticed it as well. The rumor is that he wants to make an offer that cannot be refused to Rutkowski and his mercenaries.\n\nIf he fights for us, his sins will be forgiven and the Patrol will be pardoned. Otherwise, they will be tried. And the Order will probably be the judges. Then let him not count on any justice. Any sane person would accept such an offer as long as he would save life.

Because they weren't poor and fucked up, that's for sure. And they were different. That was probably enough.

SAP_death_woods_of_velen_desc:0 "The forest spirits came out to feed. And they feed on the souls of the fallen. At least that's how horribly the ZHP units are portrayed by the panicked reports from Velen. They are ideally suited to guerrilla warfare.

Scoia'tael will be a perfectly worthy opponent for scouts. Hunters' duel. We can always send the Order to do the dirty work too.

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_ANDRZEJ_SAPKOWSKI_DESC:0 "After the collapse of the Polish state, the famous writer of the “Witcher” series  gathered loyal fans and founded his own faction in the city of Skierniewice mainly as a way of protecting himself in these chaotic times. To keep the morale of fantasy fanatics up, he decided to stylise his faction in an image of the Witcher world he created. At least that's what the cynics say, as it is also possible that the old writer has gone completely mad and his duchy is not a mere masquerade, but a genuine attempt to create a truly Temerian realm. Truth may never be revealed as the "duke" rarely speaks in public and when he does his elusive answers and dry sense of humor make it really hard to figure out what's actually on his mind."
POLITICS_JACEK_BARTYZEL_DESC:0 "Who’s to say that monarchy is dead? Bartyzel would disagree. A radical conservative, he tried to create his own catholic monarchical state in Łowicz, but failed to become one of the key players in the region due to the lack of popularity of his ideas. The situation got worse for him, when Andrzej Sapkowski arrived in the area. The writer gained wide support thanks to his fame, while the number of Bartyzel's supporters was dwindling with each passing day. Realizing his faction won't survive on his own, he swore fealty to Duke Sapkowski, promising his faithful service in exchange for the autonomous rule of the newly formed county of Łowicz. Even though he views the Duchy of Ellander as a farce, he can't deny that Sapkowski's regime is the only monarchical government, that gained traction in the lands of post-Fall Łódź Voivodeship, and because of that, he will work with Sapkowski as long as the duke respects his right to autonomous rule."
POLITICS_WLADYSLAW_BARTYZEL_DESC:0 "After much deliberation, the regency council, presided by his father, has chosen Jacek Władysław as a new King of Poland. While he had his disagreements with his father on certain political matters, he nevertheless offered him his help in governing the county of Łowicz and later he kept public support at astoundingly high levels during his father's rebellion. He may not be as conservative a carlist candidate for the throne, but he's a much safer option, as he's already well versed in warlord politics and can actually speak Polish."
POLITICS_KAROL_BURBON_DESC:0 "The current head of the House of Bourbon-Parma, as well a member of the Dutch Royal Family. He is the claimant to the defunct throne of the extinct Duchy of Parma. In addition, he is considered by some a contested claimant to the throne of Spain under the name Carlos Javier I. While he had never contested the legitimacy of the Bourbon line currently ruling in Spain, he decided to accept the offer of the Legitimist Regency Council of Poland and become a new king of the soon-to-be unified kingdom. While he's not accustomed to the brutal reality of post-Fall Poland and can't communicate with his subjects due to his unfamiliarity with their local language, his rise to power is believed to be the only for truly virtuous government within Polish lands."

There, he started building a new, better world for creatures of this world to live in - one of vibrant magic, exotic cultures and fascinating peoples. \n§4And he based if all off a world he already built in the past...§!\n\n\nWelcome to the Duchy of Ellander - a state built entirely on a premise of being a Witcher-themed Disneyland, where the army, institutions, laws and even official talks, bureaucracy and terms used in inter-clique diplomacy are all themed after things from the world of Witcher, both ones already present in the books and ones that required new lore to be written for them to be fitted into the Witcher's setting. \nHere, in bureaus-made-throne rooms, Sapkowski holds public medieval courts over flamboyantly dressed feudal vassals, merchants and advisors, all to the delight of kids and fantasy enthusiasts. While this might make for fun public events, it makes for a poor system of governance - especially since even behind closed doors the Duke orders to be refered to as 'Gwynbleidd' and speaks of 'Vizimian envoys' and 'rebellious elves in the south', all without a hint of irony in his voice. \n§tFor now, the Duke's rulership continues to bring colour to the bleak lives of Poles and his rulership is thought of by most as 'a creative way of bringing constantly feuding people together'. Some, however, are cautious of how far this LARP goes and whether this still even is a LARP at all...§! \n\nTHE GWYNBLEIDD SEEKS GUIDANCE FROM HIS TEXTS ON HOW TO SHAPE HIS REALM.
