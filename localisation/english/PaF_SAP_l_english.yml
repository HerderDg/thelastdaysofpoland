sapek.1.t:0 "His Highness, the Delirious"
sapek.1.desc:0 "In the year of our Lord 2025 the world did not end. Even though many things indicated it will. Men became wolves to one another, and great calamities have fallen upon them. The Wormwood Star fell from the heavens and poisoned a third of the land and of the waters. \n\nBut it was fun anyway. \n\nAndrzej Sapkowski stood up and adjusted the map on the wall of his „innermost private ducal chamber”, that is, the toilet. The parchment was torn and bleaked from constant redrawing and erasing of borders between warlords, up to a point when the duke simply moved it to a place more appropriate. The lines and labels have changed so many times Sapkowski considered whether not to simply wrap up the worn out Poland and flush it down. It soon will be yet another work of fiction. \n\nTruth be told, that's how everything seemed recently. As if the fate of Poland fell into hands of a whole bunch of terrible writers, spitting out pages and pages of their kitschy, badly-written political and ideological fantasies. Naturally you shouldn’t blame people for retreating into fiction when things go south, but there’s escapism and then there are warlords. It’s not an issue that people die in the name of fiction – they’ve done it a lot – but let it be a good fiction, at least. \n\nThus, the Duke wrangled his fame and contacts, and voila – Ellander was born. Its mother was self-preservation, while lust of power and money was the father paying regular alimony. Not the worst place to be, until someone – in this case synonymous with anyone – comes knocking with a real army. \n\nBut for now – Sapkowski thought while washing hands – let the people enjoy the moment. Let them be glad they’re living in a fantasy or just still living, whatever. The storm has yet to begin."

sapek.2.t:0 "Echoes of Yesterday"
sapek.2.desc:0 "– Oh, Lord, your ways are strange indeed – muttered, praying, Jacek Bartyzel. His whispers echoed through the dome of the church, audible only to God and His Mother, as Bartyzel ordered to make the temple a restricted zone while he was conversing with the Almighty about the precarious situation he found himself in. \n\nMonarchy is, as every Catholic should know, the God-ordained form of government. It is the only barrier reliable enough to defend against moral corruption and communism. That is what Bartyzel believed, although during his years in PRL and the III Republic he witnessed how monarchic ideas faded even further into oblivion and he even began thinking the cause might be lost. But God took notice and sent calamities and Anarchy as a divine punishment reminding of the right way. A problem appeared, however – no legitimate pretender would be willing in their right mind to devote themself to a broken country. Where should the monarch come from, then? Indecisive and isolated, the monarchists made a bid for power, but they quickly found out they’ve bitten off more than they could chew. \n\nSapkowski’s rise to power reminded Bartyzel of the legends told about barbarian kings from the dawn of Christian Europe. True, he’s quite godless, and many of his supporters are outright blasphemous, but have things like that stopped the Word of God for long? Bartyzel put his pride on a shelf and offered his support to the Duke. This proved a deciding factor in stabilizing the realm and keeping its borders safe. \n\nIn time the ways of the Lord will straighten. Meanwhile, Bartyzel hones his supporters into an effective, loyal and zealous paramilitary, ready to uphold the tradition of true monarchism. Conventionally named the Order of the White Rose, it has become a home for all those sympathizing with the right. For now Bartyzel, as the Grandmaster of the Order, still has to tread carefully, but when the time is right, he might be strong enough to present the throne as an offering to a more respectable, worthy and virtuous monarch. \n\n– So help me God –  he concluded, rising from the church floor and heading towards the exit."

They are a disorganized mob, and either we deal with them like one should with brigands, or they’ll act like the ones in our lands. \nSome of the council members whispered angrily. This will anger our subjects, they said. Piekara prepared for a response, but Ziemiański interrupted him. \n– It’s better not to make any enemies just as our reign has solidified. Maribor fights with gold, and that weapon will prove deadly to us, if we engage our forces carelessly. \n\n – When it comes to my opinion – Sapkowski leaned over the map – I am concerned with what happens in Wyzima. They’ve elected a „king” from among their own. This city is lawless, and ripe with crime, debauchery and whoring. We can’t leave our capital in that state. \n– These are the words of wisdom, my liege! – Bartyzel proclaimed, as his supporters clapped and nodded in an overtly enthusiastic manner. – We surely could find an ally in the Brotherhood of Bełcha... I mean Mahakam. I can reach out to them for aid. \n\n – Let us not reveal that we’re the first ones asking for help – Sapkowski replied. – For now, all I wanted is to know your opinion, and with that knowledge I’ll take a bit of time to ponder over – his  face grimaced as if he was mocking someone – our politics. But you, sir Jacek – he nodded to Dukaj – you haven’t voiced your opinion yet. \n– I don’t think there’s any point in seeking conflict now, my liege. It’s going to find us soon enough."

sapek.4.desc:0 "The explosion shattered the west fence at 23:17. Panic ensued, and while guards rallied to the site of explosion, the northern gate was bombed with handgranades. Mutilated guards were finished off with short knives. A band of men armed with submachine guns and grenades broke through into the facility. \n\nThe Director (formally addressed as „master wizard potioner to the Duke”) tried to contact the city constable immediately, but the signal was jammed. The constabulary was put on alert immediately after the explosion was heard, but just a few minutes later the town square was filled with the rattle of machine guns. A few high-speed, pocket-size technicals have broken into the city, aiming at windows and passersby and throwing grenades through broken glass. The constable, fearing this is an attempt on the Duke’s life, sent a large detachment to guard the ducal palace, ordering the rest to block the streets and attempt to surround the technicals. \n\nMeanwhile, the facility burned. The attackers showered disoriented guards witch furious fire, spreading sheer terror through the premises. While they fought, another detachment of technicals rode through the western breach, aiming straight for the laboratories and warehouses. Men clad in balaclavas got off them and in a blink of an eye reached the most coveted secrets of Duchy’s wizards. Overwhelming the few remaining guards, they begun lading technicals with testing vials, newly-devised concoctions and strongboxes containing the recipes. \n\nJust as the Director tried to make one more call, one of the raiders broke into his room and stabbed his back, howling stridently in bloody rage. The wizard fell to the floor, seeing as the fiery glow overtook the sky behind the windows. Screams, both frenzied and terrified along with thunderous explosions came from the city."

unification.5.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Duchy of Ellander unifies Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.5.desc:0 "Post-Fall Poland is a home to many weird and outlandish political movements. Few of them, however, match the new masters of Łódź in their oddity. \nAndrzej Sapkowski's clique (or kingdom, as it calls itself) has managed to win the people's hearts with its Witcher-themed aesthetics and united all of Łódź, referring to the voivodeship as Temeria. The kingdom's state structure has been described by local and international observers as a "Disneyland-state", using names and references to the Witcher franchise as a way to push its social liberal agenda. The clique was able to succeed thanks to an alliance with Jacek Bartyzel's Carlists, who took a liking to Sapkowski's "monarchy". Other statelets surrounding Łódź, who so far have thought of Temeria as of an interesting, albeit doomed to fail experiment, now watch it in concern, wondering if this Witcher LARP will be convincing enough for the Carlists, and whether it wasn't a little bit *too* convincing for Sapkowski himself."

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_ANDRZEJ_SAPKOWSKI_DESC:0 "After the collapse of the Polish state, the famous writer of the “Witcher” series  gathered loyal fans and founded his own faction in the city of Skierniewice mainly as a way of protecting himself in these chaotic times. To keep the morale of fantasy fanatics up, he decided to stylise his faction in an image of the Witcher world he created. At least that's what the cynics say, as it is also possible that the old writer has gone completely mad and his duchy is not a mere masquerade, but a genuine attempt to create a truly Temerian realm. Truth may never be revealed as the "duke" rarely speaks in public and when he does his elusive answers and dry sense of humor make it really hard to figure out what's actually on his mind."
POLITICS_JACEK_BARTYZEL_DESC:0 "Who’s to say that monarchy is dead? Bartyzel would disagree. A radical conservative, he tried to create his own catholic monarchical state in Łowicz, but failed to become one of the key players in the region due to the lack of popularity of his ideas. The situation got worse for him, when Andrzej Sapkowski arrived in the area. The writer gained wide support thanks to his fame, while the number of Bartyzel's supporters was dwindling with each passing day. Realizing his faction won't survive on his own, he swore fealty to Duke Sapkowski, promising his faithful service in exchange for the autonomous rule of the newly formed county of Łowicz. Even though he views the Duchy of Velen as a farce, he can't deny that Sapkowski's regime is the only monarchical government, that gained traction in the lands of post-Fall Łódź provine and because of that, he will work with Sapkowski as long as the duke respects his right to autonomous rule."
POLITICS_WLADYSLAW_BARTYZEL_DESC:0 "After much deliberation, the regency council, presided by his father, has chosen Jacek Władysław as a new King of Poland. While he had his disagreements with his father on certain political matters, he nevertheless offered him his help in governing the county of Łowicz and later he kept public support at astoundingly high levels during his father's rebellion. He may not be as conservative a carlist candidate for the throne, but he's a much safer option, as he's already well versed in warlord politics and can actually speak Polish."
POLITICS_KAROL_BURBON_DESC:0 "The current head of the House of Bourbon-Parma, as well a member of the Dutch Royal Family. He is the claimant to the defunct throne of the extinct Duchy of Parma. In addition, he is considered by some a contested claimant to the throne of Spain under the name Carlos Javier I. While he had never contested the legitimacy of the Bourbon line currently ruling in Spain, he decided to accept the offer of the Legitimist Regency Council of Poland and become a new king of the soon-to-be unified kingdom. While he's not accustomed to the brutal reality of post-Fall Poland and can't communicate with his subjects due to his unfamiliarity with their local language, his rise to power is believed to be the only for truly virtuous government within Polish lands."
