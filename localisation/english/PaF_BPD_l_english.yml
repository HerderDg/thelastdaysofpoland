deblin.1.t: "Choosing the Successor of Technocracy"
deblin.1.desc: "With General Mirosław Hermaszewski stepping down as the leader of the Lublin Technocracy due to health reasons, the question of his successor arises. While there are many prominent figures within the technocratic state, two names stand out among the rest: Sławosz Uznański, an ESA astronaut and the second Polish person to be in space, known for his liberal and pro-European views; and Dariusz Hoffmann, a popular science educator and YouTuber known by his online alias SciFun, who is famous for his passionate advocacy of scientific thinking and debunking of pseudo-scientific beliefs.\n\nThe decision will likely shape the future direction of the Technocracy, as Uznański is seen as a more moderate and pragmatic figure, while Hoffmann is viewed as a more autocratic leader who emphasizes centralized control to achieve scientific progress. The citizens of the Technocracy eagerly await the announcement of their new leader."
deblin.1.a: "Sławosz will lead us to the stars!"
deblin.1.b: "SciFun will bring us the future!"

unification.13.t: "[GetNewspaper]Dęblin Technocrats unify Lublin Voivodeship!"
unification.13.desc: "The wars for Lubelskie seem to be over, with a technocratic faction managing to achieve full control over the entire region. The administration of the newly proclaimed Lublin Technocracy consists primarily of scientists, engineers, and science educators from a wide range of fields who believe that the best system of governance is one where all major decisions are made by technical specialists within their area of expertise in order find the most optimal, apolitical solution to any given problem. With its emphasis set on the pursuit of scientific advancements, the Technocratic state aims to progress humanity toward a seemingly elusive, utopian society, free from the strife currently besetting the world.\n\nThough this goal may seem far-fetched, under the leadership of General Mirosław Hermaszewski, the first Pole to reach space during the communist era and an icon representing the country's desires to reach the stars, no dream is set to remain beyond reality."
unification.13.a: "Can Poland into space for the third time?"

deblin.2.t: "[GetNewspaper]Sławosz Uznański assumes the leadership of the Technocracy"
deblin.2.desc: "In what seems to be a reflection of Poland's history of contributions to space exploration, the torch of leadership in the Lublin Technocracy has been passed from the first Polish person to be in space to the second one. The old Cosmonaut Mirosław Hermaszewski has announced that due to health reasons he'll be stepping down as the head of the technocratic state, and he named Sławosz Uznański to be his successor.\n\nThe ESA astronaut, while assuring to be a technocrat at heart in his first speech after assuming the leadership, seems to have a more moderate and pragmatic approach to implementing actual technocratic policies compared to his predecessor. During the speech he also stressed his liberal stance on social issues, as well as his general pro-European outlook. While many criticized him for his implied pro-German sympathies, the overall public sentiment towards the change seems to be positive."
deblin.2.a: "He seemed like the obvious choice."

deblin.3.t: "[GetNewspaper]Dariusz \"SciFun\" Hoffmann assumes the leadership of the Technocracy"
deblin.3.desc: "After successfully leading the Technocracy towards the unification of Lublin Voivodeship under its banner, the old Cosmonaut Mirosław Hermaszewski has announced that due to health reasons he decided to step down as the head of the technocratic state, and named Dariusz Hoffmann to be his successor.\n\nHoffmann, more widely known by his online alias SciFun, was chosen most likely due to his popularity as a YouTube science educator and entertainer. In his first speech after assuming the leadership he reaffirmed his commitment to the cause of pursuing scientific and technological advancements, and declared that he'll be cracking down on all influences of pseudo-scientific thinking on the Technocracy's society. Compared to his predecessor's Hoffmann's views seem to be somewhat more autocratic, as he claims that more centralized leadership is necessary to achieve more efficient path towards scientific progress."
deblin.3.a: "Flat-earthers be coping and seething."

super.13.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.13.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided.

As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.13.a: "United at last."
