unification.13.t: "[GetNewspaper]Technocracy unifies the Lublin Voivodeship!"
unification.13.desc: "The wars for Lubelskie seem to be now over, as the technocratic faction managed to achieve full control over the entire region. The administration of the newly proclaimed Lublin Technocracy consists mainly of various kinds of scientists, engineers and science educators. They believe that the best system of governance is the one where all the decisions are made by the technical experts in the respective fields, so that they can find the most optimal solution to any given problem. The Technocratic government also puts great emphasis on the significance of scientific and technological advancements as means to progress humanity towards utopian society, which is what they ultimately want to accomplish.\n\nThe state is led by General Mirosław Hermaszewski, famous for being the first Polish person to reach space during communist times, which turned him into an icon representing Polish desires for reaching the stars."
unification.13.a: "Can Poland into space for the third time?"

deblin.2.t: "[GetNewspaper]Sławosz Uznański assumes the leadership of the Technocracy"
deblin.2.desc: "In what seems to be a reflection of Poland’s history of contributions to space exploration, the torch of leadership in the Lublin Technocracy has been passed from the first Polish person to be in space to the second one. The old Cosmonaut Mirosław Hermaszewski has announced that due to health reasons he’ll be stepping down as the head of the technocratic state, and he named Sławosz Uznański to be his successor.\n\nThe ESA astronaut, while assuring to be a technocrat at heart in his first speech after assuming the leadership, seems to have a more moderate and pragmatic approach to implementing actual technocratic policies compared to his predecessor. During the speech he also stressed his liberal stance on social issues, as well as his general pro-European outlook. While many criticized him for his implied pro-German sympathies, the overall public sentiment towards the change seems to be positive."
deblin.2.a: "He seemed like the obvious choice."

deblin.3.t: "[GetNewspaper]Dariusz "SciFun" Hoffmann assumes the leadership of the Technocracy"
deblin.3.desc: "After successfully leading the Technocracy towards the unification of Lublin Voivodeship under its banner, the old Cosmonaut Mirosław Hermaszewski has announced that due to health reasons he decided to step down as the head of the technocratic state, and named Dariusz Hoffmann to be his successor.\n\nHoffmann, more widely known by his online alias SciFun, was chosen most likely due to his popularity as a YouTube science educator and entertainer. In his first speech after assuming the leadership he reaffirmed his commitment to the cause of pursuing scientific and technological advancements, and declared that he’ll be cracking down on all influences of pseudo-scientific thinking on the Technocracy’s society. Compared to his predecessor’s Hoffmann’s views seem to be somewhat more autocratic, as he claims that more centralized leadership is necessary to achieve more efficient path towards scientific progress."
deblin.3.a: "Flat-earthers be coping and seething."
