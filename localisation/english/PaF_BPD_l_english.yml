unification.13.desc:0 "The wars for Lubelskie seem to be now over, as the technocratic faction managed to achieve full control over the entire region. The government of the newly proclaimed Lublin Technocracy is mainly made up of various kinds of scientists as well as science educators, and its stated goal is to help humanity progress to an utopian society through rapid technological advancements. The state is led by General Mirosław Hermaszewski, famous for being the first Polish person to reach space during communist times, which made him an icon for Polish science enthusiasts.\n\nWhile the Technocracy’s goals may seem admirable at first, many consider putting such a big focus on advancing high technology during these difficult times to be counterproductive and foolish. And yet its leadership remains undeterred, staunch in its belief that science is what will allow its state and society to grow and prosper."
