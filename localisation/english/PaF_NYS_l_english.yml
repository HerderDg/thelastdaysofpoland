unification.68.t: "[GetNewspaper]City of Nysa unifies Opolskie!"
unification.68.desc: "To the shock of citizens both within and outside the region, the Opolskie Voivodeship has been reunified by Kordian Kolbiarz – the mayor of the relatively small and peaceful town of Nysa. While at first, no one believed that a simple local politician could possibly conquer the vast plains and canola-growing fields of the province, expecting him to serve merely as fodder for more powerful warlords, the forces of Nysa managed to not just repel Sanjaya’s goons out of the city, but maintain their momentum, first reclaiming the entirety of the county, and eventually also the whole voivodeship. Following a passionate speech from his headquaters’ balcony, Kolbiarz and his cabinet have been seen hurriedly making their way to the regional capital of Opole, where he is set to officially don the Marshall’s chain. Perhaps, against all odds, the town’s government has become a serious player on the national stage."
unification.68.a: "The mayor's career just got its much-needed boost"

super.68.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.68.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.68.a: "United at last."
