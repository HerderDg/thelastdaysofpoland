 better_city_stuff: "Reestablished Tertiary Education Network"
 better_city_stuff_desc: "Though our universities were reduced to mere ruins, and our professors scattered like leaves in the wind, the pursuit of knowledge cannot be extinguished so easily. With great effort (and a fair bit of bartering for intact textbooks), we have begun rebuilding a network of higher education institutions. While some faculties operate out of abandoned shopping malls and professors are paid in potatoes, the wheels of academia are turning once more." 
 better_januszex: "Commercial & Corporate Infrastructure Improvement"
 better_januszex_desc: "Our commercial infrastructure projects have managed to bring back some normalcy in our people's lives, but in order to fully bring them back to the XXIst century, we'll have to provide more than 80's sheet metal warehouses and kiosks. \n\nOur country's existing and future commercial infrastructure needs to be reelectrified and modernized: streets with shops need to be lit up again, shopping malls need to be repopulated by stores and corporate high-rises need to be resettled by poor office workers, toiling their lives away for their lovely corporate overlords."

primitive_high_tech_industry: "Professional Cable Theft"
primitive_high_tech_industry_desc: "We can supply ourselves with found, old electronics by recruiting people who already have some experience with stealing electronic wires and dumpster diving, and speaking of cable theft - do you remember how people before the Fall used scare off cable thieves? How they'd call cops on them? How they'd shout at them that they should 'get a real job' and that they should 'stop being homeless fucks who waste their life savings on alcohol'? Yeah, I wonder how those dumbasses feel NOW when these 'homeless fucks' are supplying the whole nation in cables and circuitry!"
basic_high_tech_industry: "Repurposed Civilian Electronics"
basic_high_tech_industry_desc: "Plenty of still functioning PC rigs and screens can be found in abandoned houses that scavengers didn't manage to break into. These machines - used previously to run the newest CoD and Arma installments at a whopping +20 frames per second - are just begging to be used by our military for what such games are trying (...or at least claiming) to replicate: actual combat. \n...so what that our armored vehicles are going to be operated using Xbox pads? I've even heard some soldiers actually prefer driving them by using console pads over their native steering devices!..."
advanced_high_tech_industry: "Chinese-Style Tech & Electronics Factories"
advanced_high_tech_industry_desc: "If we are to truly modernize our military, we have to have a developed tech & electronic systems manufacturing sector, and if we are to revive our mil-tech industry, we'll need to bring back the manufacturing of simple electronics first to then move up and restore the production of more advanced military tech of it. Let's begin by establishing low-cost electronic devices factories that employ thousands of badly paid workers. \nStep aside, China - it's OUR time to trap hundreds of people in factories to make crappy LED displays and malfunctioning rangefinders!"
world_renown_high_tech_industry: "Military High-Tech & Electronics Industry Revival"
world_renown_high_tech_industry_desc: "Our state has completely changed over the years, evolving from a small clique centered around a bunch of hooligans commanded around by some old, rich people into a state with a proper, modern, *computerized* army - one whose very weapons make complex calculations to provide their users with information and guide their missiles to score pinpoint hits on enemy positions and vehicles. \nSuch smart weaponry costs extreme amounts of cash on the market, so supplying ourselves in foreign-made models only is a no-no at this point -- we have to kickstart our own production of smart weapons and military computers instead."

basic_coalstuff: "Professional Artisanal Miners"
basic_coalstuff_desc: "Mining in bootleg pits ain't easy, son. Random people thrown into the mines with the hope that they won't send the mine's ceiling crashing down are too unreliable and unprepared for hard physical work underground for 15 hours at a time. \n\nWe need SPECIALISTS. The most crafty and resilient types -- those who can endure crawling though a suffocating wooden tunnel for long enough to strike it big. It's those specific people we should rely on to provide us with the black stuff."
improved_coalstuff: "Coal Mining Industry Revival"
improved_coalstuff_desc: "No matter if it's a strip mine, a shaft mine or an open-pit mine, digging for coal ultimately boils down to hitting dirt with a shovel or a pick. And what's so hard in bringing a couple of elevators and air pumps glued to a tunnel back to function? We're perfectly capable of restoring our country's coal mines without any hardships. \n\nWe'll just have to ignore their profitability." 
advanced_coalstuff: "Modernized Coal Mines"
advanced_coalstuff_desc: "Poland managed to quickly reestablish her communist economy into a free market one, but in order to do so, she had to sacrifice her mining industry. Due to this, plenty of coal mines in the country remain in an unrenovated, outdated Cold War-era form, lagging behind modern ones in efficiency. So -... \n\n...if we are to fully restore them to function, we might as well renovate and upgrade them, right?"

basic_recycling: "Abandoned Areas Surveys"
basic_recycling_desc: "Our ''army'' lives off found items left behind by those who escaped or perished during the Fall, collecting tools, materials and even their service weapons from locations near their posts. All this work must be very tiring to them, however, and we should relieve them from this. \nWe need to survey the areas abandoned during the Fall and thoroughly search through them, collecting any supplies that can be used by our troops and sending them to 'em so that they don't have to bother with scavenging for supplies themselves."
improved_recycling: "Partial Materials Recovery Facilities Revival"
improved_recycling_desc: "Bringing trash recycling facilities back to function could greatly raise the standard of living in our lands by restoring everyday items like bottles or cans back to a serviceable state, reducing their scarcity and thus - the amount of hoarding of trash everyday citizens have to do. Sure, we might be ideologically opposed to this and sure, it will be very costly, but - counterpoint: \na) who said we can't use this to punish people \nand b) ...who said we have to pay them?"
advanced_recycling: "Steel Industry Revival"
advanced_recycling_desc: "As our army increases in size and we simultaneously move towards forming armored corps, we need to make sure we've got enough equipment to give them. To have enough equipment, we need to produce enough stuff to make that equipment from - and thankfully, it doesn't take a genius to reforge some scrap into a big metal donut. \nWe have enough money and usable scrap to partially restart the fragments of steel industry that reside in our lands. Soon, we can have our own, properly made knives, shovels, guns, cars and even simplistic tanks."

basic_smelters: "Small-Scale Military-Grade Alloy Foundries"
basic_smelters_desc: "Attempting to develop an industry producing tank armor-issue materials whilst ruling over a bumfuck statelet that hasn't even developed a proper infantry army seems like a lost cause... \n\n...because it is, but by organizing at least a few small alloy producing plants we could potentially start supplying ourselves in enough military-grade metal to be able to conduct very basic, uncomplicated repairs of armored vehicles we managed to purchase from abroad."
improved_smelters: "High-Grade Metals Use"
improved_smelters_desc: "With more money in our hands and less bombs flying over our industrial centers that might accidentally set off some weird chemical reaction in one of our metal-making facilities that would burn it and the entire city surrounding it, we're more easily able to supply ourselves in higher-grade, less commonly available materials used to produce vehicle armor that's harder, better, lighter and stronger."
advanced_smelters: "Military-Grade Alloy Manufacturing Industry"
advanced_smelters_desc: "Since we're getting closer and closer to completely restoring the country's borders, we have to start preparing our troops to defend the country from foreign forces - ones that aren't composed of ragtag militias with just a few properly organized units hidden among the ranks. In order to at the very least bog down any invading forces, we need to at least be able to produce our own rockets or drones and to outfit old vehicles with some additional armor made of more durable, advanced materials."

heavy_monitor_armor_3_desc: "Simple, but thick armor used by heavy ships, mitigating most of damage dealt by impromptu weaponry used by warlord navies."
heavy_monitor_armor_4: "Modern Heavy Naval Armor"
heavy_monitor_armor_4_desc: "Though most modern navies only use light armor due to heavier armor not being that effective against most modern naval and rocket weaponry, in a combat between not as strongly armed warlord fleets heavy protection can be extremely useful."

torpedos_4_desc: "Proper torpedo launchers and modern torpedoes, used by navies worldwide."
post_collapse_assesment: "Post-Fall Assessment"
post_collapse_assesment_desc: "The Polish state has succumbed into chaos and disintegrated. Laws are enforced ad-hoc, most industries have died or stopped working and most people have to ration food, water and other resources due to the downfall of most supply chains and shops (besides Żabka. Żabka could survive a fucking nuclear disaster and still somehow capitalize on it), resulting in what is basically a light post-apo scenario. \n\nWe have to assess the damage done during the Fall to start rebuilding a new state out of the ruins of old Poland."
improvised_computing: "Civilian-Grade Government Computing"
improvised_computing_desc: "We currently have to rely on mobile phones, handwritten documents and a few spare printers and laptops that belonged to people forming our new government, most of them still running Windows Vista. By gathering and restoring whatever civilian computers we can find, we can at least *partially* restore normalcy in how the government operates. At least in moments when the neighbouring warlords aren't burdening the power grid."
early_civilian_computing: "Reestablishment Of Businesses & Civilian Computing"
early_civilian_computing_desc: "As the chaos in the country died down, the emerging political movements became entrenched and people got used to living in a war-torn country, the population slowly started rebuilding itself, reestablishing their businesses and/or workplaces and using computers on a daily basis again, which sets us on a course to veeeeeeeeeeery slowly revert the brain drain that our country suffered from during the Fall."
civilian_computing: "Reestablished Education System & Basic Military Development Sectors"
civilian_computing_desc: "As our statelet grows in power and possesses more resources, we can finally start rebuilding the education sector of the government, reestablishing smaller, rural education facilities, providing them with resources and providing people with easier access to them. \nWe can also establish a proper - if very basic - military development sector in the army and the government, so that our army no longer has to test and adapt new equipment by testing it in a far-away field, hoping that it doesn't explode and instantly kill them during usage."
imported_mainframes: "Reestablished Intelligentsia"
imported_mainframes_desc: "As the country rebuilds itself, and more and more elements of pre-Fall life return back, our political and academic spheres start to claw back to life, with academies and universities slowly filling back in and various small political notions evolving amongst people. By luring parts of intelligentsia back to our country, we can start to properly revert the brain drain in our lands."
military_grade_computing: "Military-Grade Government Computing & Advanced Military Development Sectors"
military_grade_computing_desc: "As we've evolved into a proper state, our need for computing power, room for data storage and a proper military development sector in the government has increased tenfold. By establishing an advanced governmental military R&D body and restoring the military-grade governmental computers that used to serve the old Polish gov, we can finally enter the Proper Government Club and start operating as a proper, established power in Central Europe."
improvised_ballistic_computer: "Civilian-Grade Computers w/ Military Integration"
improvised_ballistic_computer_desc: "We have barely any (if any at all) access to computers that whould allow us to use modern military vehicles and equipment - ergo, we have to resort to using normal, civilian computers that have been integrated with military tech, allowing us to use modern weapons or to use them as improvised onboard computers."

modern_ballistic_computer_desc: "G.I. Joe shit used by modern military weapon systems and vehicles, such as onboard computers, radars, guiding lasers, etc."
improvised_radio: "Civilian Radio & Radar Technology"
improvised_radio_desc: "As Poland vanished, so did most of its military infrastructure and equipment - most army facilities have been robbed clean or thrashed completely, leaving us only with civilian radios (usually household ones or old, portable ones used by fishing grandpas), walkie-takies used by kids and few civilian radars that usually serve single, very specific purposes. Thankfully, most cliques in Poland are as ragtag as us, so currently we're fine with civilian radios and radars that have been tinkered with to adapt them for army purposes."
battlefield_management_systems: "Modern Battlefield Management Systems"
battlefield_management_systems_desc: "A battlefield management system - BMS for short - is a system meant to integrate information acquisition and processing to enhance command and control of a military unit. Tech like this whould sharply increase our commandeering possibilities and the ease of acquiring data about the battlefield and the general terrain around it for both us AND for soldiers transmitting data to us."
air_radio_control_1: "Rudimentary Aircraft Detection Techniques"

air_radio_control_3: "Cold War-Era Air Radar"
air_radio_control_3_desc: "Cheap military air radars that - given their age and Soviet origins - were probably used back in the Polish People's Army before getting sold and then bought back to Poland. Obviously, they're completely terrible compared to modern detection techniques."

air_radio_control_4_desc: "Modern military aircraft detection techniques and systems that help with detecting and dealing with most modern air vehicles used in armies."
reconnecting_to_www: "Reconnecting to the Web"
reconnecting_to_www_desc: "In order to grow our influence, enstreghten our agendas and make new connections with powerful factions, we need to establish a social media presence that will appeal to useful idiots such as jaded millenials, 12 year old redditors and weirdos enhabiting various imageboards. Having our own social media presence, it will be easy for us to "

basic_opsec_desc: "Guide on how to avoid blewing all of our plans by talking too much on the Internet: \n1) DO NOT TALK ABOUT OUR PLANS, GOALS AND LOCATIONS, 2) CHECK WHAT'S IN THE BACKGROUND OF PHOTOS TAKEN BY YOU, 3) DO NOT CLICK SHADY LINKS OR RUN SHADY PROGRAMS, 4) DO NOT BROWSE PORN ON COMPUTERS BELONGING TO GOVERNMENT BODIES, 5) IF YOU'RE ABOVE 45 YEARS OLD, LET THE YOUNGSTERS OPERATE YOUR WORK STATION - AT THIS POINT, YOU'RE JUST TOO OLD TO LEARN HOW TO USE A COMPUTER."
vpn_and_tor: "VPNs & Onion Routing"
vpn_and_tor_desc: "To further secure our data, we can employ cheaply available civilian-grade encryption techniques, such as using VPNs and onion routing. A proper government would still have an easy time finding our Internet activity, but for Polish standards such measures will be more than enough. \n\nNow comes the hard part, however: how do we teach 60 years old clerks how to use Tor?"
not_pegasus: "Exclusive Communication Networks"
not_pegasus_desc: "With much more funds and power in our hands, we are finally able to create our own network for exchanging information between various government agencies - one inaccessible to anyone outside the government.

adhoc_trollbrigades: "Ad Hoc Troll Brigades"
adhoc_trollbrigades_desc: "Cold War has ruined the public image of wars. World order set in 2001 started to break down and now people start to thirst for blood of others once more, yet war is still percieved as an ugly, and - most importantly - a very unnecessary thing. Because of that, every modern country that gets into conflicts with others employs internet trolls to sway people to their side and cover any mishaps that happened while they were enforcing their will upon others. We should do the same - let's recruit some people to start spreading propaganda in social media to turn people against our enemies and to make ourselves look better in their eyes."
internet_troll_agencies: "Professional Troll Brigades"
internet_troll_agencies_desc: "Amateurish trolls can be useful, but over time people start to realise they're just shouting things on the Internet. Professional troll agencies, however, are able to sow so much disinformation and chaos in the Web to affect politics in other countries and create loyalists that support foreign regimes with their lives despite never having any contact with them or their countries. The past Russian government has mastered this technique, employing internet troll farms to dictate how anti-American politics are conducted on the Internet, and we should establish similar troll cells in our government to sow foreign support for our cause."
ai_trollbots: "AI Trollbots & Troll Brigades"
ai_trollbots_desc: "The early '20s were a period of major development of machine learning bots. Bots of all kinds - image-creating bots, chat bots, and of course - trollbots. Trollbots that were fed with so many data samples, that they were almost able to pass the Turing test, as shown by a bot fed with samples from /pol/ that managed to fool many 4chan users into thinking that it's a real person. Over years, more and more such bots were employed by troll farms to spread agendas over the Internet, therefore, to increase the effeciency of our troll agencies, we should start investing into bots (let's start with simple ones) helping with sowing chaos in Internet discourses."
advanced_ai_trollbots: "Professionally-Made AI Trollbots & Troll Brigades"
advanced_ai_trollbots_desc: "An advanced, machine-learning algorythm - a perfect propaganda machine, that lures edgy American teenargers and 'woke' horoscope-reading spiritualists into sacrificing their hearts and minds for an agenda that was made up by a bunch of old men fighting a war in Central Europe. If we were to find the right person that could create a bot like this for our purposes, our government's trolls could multiply the effectiveness and the reach of our troll agencies by tenfolds, potentially creating a permament mark on Internet politics and worldviews."
