unification.64.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Mandate of Opole unifies Opolskie!"
unification.64.desc: "When the last fights between the armies of, let's say gently, the 'reason-skeptical' warlords and the Opole State were dying down in the Opole region, Paweł Kukiz already addressed the nation. In this Appeal, its Provisional Government promised to hold a new election for President in the 'near future'. Considered by many as the only guarantor of stability for the Polish population in the Opole region, there are high hopes for him. Congratulations are already coming to Opole from various parts of Poland, mainly from warlords related to a greater or lesser extent with the 'pre-fall' authorities.\n\nThe city is definitely awake, and it's not going to go to sleep anytime soon. However, will Opole have enough strength to overcome the more powerful authorities of Lower and Upper Silesia?"
unification.64.a: "Cit...no, Poland wakes up!"

super.64.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.64.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
