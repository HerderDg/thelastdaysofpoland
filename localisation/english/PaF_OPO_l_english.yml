unification.64.desc:0 "When the last fights between the armies of, let's say gently, the "reason-skeptical" warlords and the Opole State were dying down in the Opole region, Paweł Kukiz already addressed the nation. In this Appeal, its Provisional Government promised to hold a new election for President in the "near future". Considered by many as the only guarantor of stability for the Polish population in the Opole region, there are high hopes for him. Congratulations are already coming to Opole from various parts of Poland, mainly from warlords related to a greater or lesser extent with the 'pre-fall' authorities.\n\nThe city is definitely awake, and it's not going to go to sleep anytime soon. However, will Opole have enough strength to overcome the more powerful authorities of Lower and Upper Silesia?"
unification.64.a:0 "Cit...no, Poland wakes up!"
