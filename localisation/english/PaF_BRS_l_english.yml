unification.179.t: "[GetNewspaper]Estates of Brzesko Unite Lesser Poland Voivodeship!"
unification.179.desc: "In a monumental shift, the Estates of Brzesko - formerly known as Optimus - have united the Lesser Poland Voivodeship under the banner of a new, technocratic age. With precision and innovation at their helm, the Estates declare the dawn of a future where technology, industry, and intellect reign supreme.\n\nFrom the bustling streets of Tarnów to the industrious heart of Kraków, engineers, scholars, and machine enthusiasts alike have rallied to the cause, pledging to forge a society that balances progress with tradition. The Estates, now reimagined as a force of calculated ambition, vow to rebuild the region through digital prowess, automated agriculture, and perhaps even the occasional robot-powered joust. With gears turning, computers humming, and the spirit of innovation driving them forward, the Estates of Brzesko lead Lesser Poland into a new era of prosperity and precision."
unification.179.a: "To technology! To progress! To future!"
