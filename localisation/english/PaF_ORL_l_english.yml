unification.110.t: "[GetNewspaper]Petrocracy of Płock unifies North Mazovia!"
unification.110.desc: "The Fall did little to stifle the growing influence of the corporate giant known as PKN Orlen. Morawiecki's decision to empower the company would prove to be one of his gravest errors, as one day, he'd find himself directly opposed by the full might of its hegemonic economic influence. History books will forever remember that the end of the longest-serving Prime Minister's reign and the final, dying breath of the Third Polish Republic came at the hands of Daniel Obajtek. The petrobaron's state is one built on total corporate oversight, with Orlen spreading into virtually every branch of daily life, from groceries to housing, creating an ingenious system where the products of the population's labor are immediately reinvested back into the company. Now menacingly overlooking the capital, Orlen's chairman eyes new avenues for growth, and no part of Poland is safe from his grasp."
unification.110.a: "The only true gold is black."

super.110.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.110.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.110.a: "United at last."
