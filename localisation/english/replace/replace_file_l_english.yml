 construction4:0 "Large-Scale Reconstruction"
 construction4_desc:0 "Abandoned sports centres, factories and shopping malls might make for good urban exploration spots, but their size and upkeep costs significantly outweight the benefits of simply leaving them be and letting them slowly crumble away.

 fuel_refining2_desc:0 "We desperately need to secure more gas for ourselves, and we have no ways of producing any ourselves. That leaves us with only one option: let's just steal from the supplies of our rivals! We need to organize raiding parties dedicated to looting enemy gas stations and fuel silos.
