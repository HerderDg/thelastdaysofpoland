czarnek.1.t:0 "Lord’s Guidance"
czarnek.1.desc:0 "It was early morning and the Lublin Cathedral was still almost empty, with only one man being present inside. Kneeling at the church pews and quietly muttering the words of prayer was Przemysław Czarnek. He came here, as he often does, to ask God to guide him in his next day of work of ruling the Catholic Republic, and to give him the strength and courage to fight against the corrosive forces that are constantly trying to undermine his people’s proud society. But as long as he lives he will never allow leftism to win, and to further destroy everything he holds so dear.\n\nHe finished his prayer, crossed himself, grabbed the pew in the front of him and was about to stand up and leave. But he sensed that his thumb touched something unusual underneath the grabbed surface. He leaned to check what it was, and was shocked when he saw the symbol. It was a sticker of the LGBT rainbow flag.\n\nRage immidiately started filling him inside. Not necessarily towards the cultural Marxism itself, or the proof that there are still rebellious people hiding their leftist loyalties while walking on the Republic-controlled streets of Lublin. He was furious that someone dared to do this disgusting act in such a sacred place. It seems that some Marxist pretended to be a devout Christian, came to the Mass, and while pretty much standing right in front of God decided to spit into His face by sneakily placing this symbol of deviancy right in the middle of the praying crowd. Czarnek couldn’t imagine a greater offense.\n\nA few moments of quiet, internal anger passed, after which he took few deep breaths and forced himself to calm down. This wasn’t the place to get angry, even if he had every right to be. But no, not here."
czarnek.1.a:0 "Not in the House of God."


unification.7.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Catholic Republic unifies the Lublin Voivodeship"
unification.7.desc:0 "Some new information has reached us from Eastern Poland. Reports say that the provisional government of Przemysław Czarnek, a Deputy Prime Minister before the state’s collapse and a former Lublinian Voivode, after many months of local conflicts has recently gained control of the entirety of the Lublin Voivodeship.\n\nPrzemysław Czarnek has been considered one of the most outspoken and controversial figures of the Law and Justice government. As a staunch social conservative, he’s been claiming that cultural Marxism and LGBT ideology are the biggest threats to the Polish nation, and their spread needs to be stopped as quickly as possible. His rule in the now unified Lublin region seems to be reflecting that, with reports of LGBT persecution and a strong presence of the Catholic Church commonly making their way to other parts of the country."
unification.7.a:0 "A conservative region, reclaimed by Law and Justice."

POLITICS_PRZEMYSLAW_CZARNEK_DESC:0 "Cultural Marxism has infiltrated Poland. European neo-Bolshevism, LGBT deviancy, spineless atheism, Western so-called \"progressivism\" and \"liberalism\" – they are all trying to destroy the very foundations of our nation and society. They want to indoctrinate our children, dismantle the natural, traditional model of the family, erase our proud history, and make us abandon Christ and His teachings. In these dire times, only one man still has the courage to oppose these evil forces.\n\nPrzemysław Czarnek has been warning the Polish people for many years. As a KUL professor, as a Lublinian Voivode, then as a Minister of Education, and later as a deputy Prime Minister of Poland. And yet people wouldn’t listen. He has been ridiculed, despised, protested against. But he never lost faith in his mission. He stood firm in the defense of Polish and Christian values. And when the next step of the leftist plan succeeded and the Polish state fell apart, he knew that his mission became more important than ever.\n\nHe managed to secure and alliance of convenience with two influential Lublinian far-right activists, and with their combined forces they were able to gain control of a large, Western portion of Lublin Voivodeship, including its capital. This newly founded power called the National Front was ready to keep expanding in their quest of bringing Polish society back to their Christian roots, but the cracks in the alliance rapidly began to show. In a predictable turn of events, the primitive fascist brute and the crazy Protestant cult leader have proved themselves to be as vile as everyone else, and soon they betrayed him in a miserable attempt to gain as much personal power as they can.\n\nThe Front lies fractured. Czarnek couldn’t stop neither their secession in the north and south, nor the anarchist uprising in the east, which even spread to a large part of Lublin. However, while he lost most of the territory, he finally gained actual control. Only now is he able to fully implement his Catholic policies, free from squabbles of his former allies. The real crusade for the Polish soul begins now, and as Czarnek has never lost faith in his mission before, he doesn’t intend to do it today."
