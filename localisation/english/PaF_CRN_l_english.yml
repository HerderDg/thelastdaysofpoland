unification.7.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Catholic Republic of Lublin unifies Lublin Voivodeship"
unification.7.desc:0 "Some new information has reached us from Eastern Poland. Reports say that the provisional government of Przemysław Czarnek, a Deputy Prime Minister before the state’s collapse, and a former Lublinian voivode, after many months of local conflicts has recently gained control of the entirety of the Lublin voivodeship.\n\nPrzemysław Czarnek has been considered one of the most outspoken and controversial members of Law and Justice government. As a staunch social conservative, he’s been claiming that cultural Marxism and LGBT ideology are the biggest threats to Polish nation, and their spread needs to be stopped as quickly as possible. His rule in the now unified Lublin region seems to be reflecting that, with reports of LGBT persecution and a strong presence of Catholic Church commonly making their way outside his territory."
unification.7.a:0 "A conservative region reclaimed by Law and Justice."

POLITICS_PRZEMYSLAW_CZARNEK_DESC:0 "The cultural Marxism has infiltrated Poland. European neo-Bolshevism, LGBT deviancy, spineless atheism, Western so called \"progressivism\" and \"liberalism\" – they are all trying to destroy the very foundations of our nation and society. They want to indoctrinate our children, dismantle the natural, traditional model of the family, erase our proud history, and make us abandon Christ and His teachings. In these dire times, only one man still has the courage to oppose these evil forces.\n\nPrzemysław Czarnek has been warning the Polish people for many years. As a KUL professor, as a Lublinian voivode, then as a Minister of Education, and later as a deputy Prime Minister of Poland. And yet people wouldn’t listen. He has been ridiculed, despised, protested against. But he never lost faith in his mission. He stood firm in the defense of Polish and Christian values. And when the next step of leftist plan succeeded and Polish state has fallen apart, he knew that his mission became more important than ever.\n\nHe managed to secure and alliance of convenience with two influential Lublinian far-right activists, and with their combined forces they were able to gain control of a large, Western portion of Lublin voivodeship, including its capital. This newfound power called National Front was ready to keep expanding in their quest of bringing the Polish society back to their Christian roots, but instantly the cracks have begun to show. In a predictable turn of events the primitive fascist brute and the crazy Protestant cult leader have proved themselves to be as vile as everyone else, and soon they betrayed him in a miserable attempt to gain as much personal power as they can.\n\nThe Front lies fractured. Czarnek couldn’t stop neither their secession in the North and South, nor the anarchist uprising in the East, which even spread to a large part of Lublin. However, while he lost most of the territory, he finally gained actual control. Only now he is able to fully implement his Catholic policies, free from squabble of his former allies. The real crusade for Polish soul begins now, and as Czarnek never lost faith in his mission before, he doesn’t intend to do it today."
