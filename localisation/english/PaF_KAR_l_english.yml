POLITICS_JACEK_BARTYZEL_DESC: "Who’s to say that monarchy is dead? Bartyzel would disagree. \n\nA radical conservative, he tried to create his own catholic monarchical state in Łowicz, but failed to become one of the key players in the region due to the lack of popularity of his ideas. The situation got worse for him, when Andrzej Sapkowski arrived in the area. The writer gained wide support thanks to his fame, while the number of Bartyzel's supporters wasn't even high enough to start dwindling in the first place. Realizing his faction won't survive on his own, he swore fealty to Duke Sapkowski, promising his faithful service in exchange for the autonomous rule of the newly formed county of Łowicz. Even though he views the Duchy of Ellander as a farce, he can't deny that Sapkowski's regime is the only monarchical government that gained traction in the lands of post-Fall Łódź Voivodeship, and because of that, he will work with Sapkowski as long as the duke respects his right to autonomous, Catholic-style rule."

POLITICS_WLADYSLAW_BARTYZEL_DESC: "After much deliberation, the regency council, presided by his father, has chosen Jacek Władysław as a new King of Poland. While he had his disagreements with his father on certain political matters, he nevertheless offered him his help in governing the county of Łowicz and later he kept public support at astoundingly high levels during his father's rebellion. He may not be as conservative a carlist candidate for the throne, but he's a much safer option, as he's already well versed in warlord politics and can actually speak Polish."

POLITICS_KAROL_BURBON_DESC: "Carlos Javier Bernardo Sixto Marie prins de Bourbon de Parme is the current head of the House of Bourbon-Parma, as well a member of the Dutch Royal Family. His bloodline makes him a claimant of the long extinct Duchy of Parma and - according to Carlists - the Kingdom of Spain as well, and while it's unsurprising that he has made no real attempts to obtain neither of those thrones, absolutely noone expected him ending up being invited to rule a wartorn, Central European shithole. \n\nKarol Ksawery Burbon-Parmeński - as those moonrunes-speaking locals call him - has been declared by the Legitimist Regency Council of Poland to be the monarch of their soon-to-be united kingdom. Not accustomed to the brutal reality of post-Fall Poland and unable to communicate with his new subjects, Karol tries his hardest to hide his wishes of abstinence from politics and ruling as a purely symbolic monarch away from the monarchists in charge who see him as the only force able to cleanse Poland of its imperfections and lack of virtue. Unable to pull off a Henryk Walezy, the only option left for him is to clench his teeth, muster up some strenght and give Poland what she wants - a Catholic ruler worth following into battle for their country"
