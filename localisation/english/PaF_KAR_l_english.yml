POLITICS_JACEK_BARTYZEL_DESC: "Who's to say that monarchy is dead? Bartyzel would disagree. \n\nA radical conservative, he tried to create his own catholic monarchical state in Łowicz, but failed to become one of the key players in the region due to the lack of popularity of his ideas. The situation got worse for him, when Andrzej Sapkowski arrived in the area. The writer gained wide support thanks to his fame, while the number of Bartyzel's supporters wasn't even high enough to start dwindling in the first place. Realizing his faction won't survive on his own, he swore fealty to Duke Sapkowski, promising his faithful service in exchange for the autonomous rule of the newly formed county of Łowicz. Even though he views the Duchy of Ellander as a farce, he can't deny that Sapkowski's regime is the only monarchical government that gained traction in the lands of post-Fall Łódź Voivodeship, and because of that, he will work with Sapkowski as long as the duke respects his right to autonomous, Catholic-style rule."

POLITICS_WLADYSLAW_BARTYZEL_DESC: "After much deliberation, the regency council, presided by his father, has chosen Jacek Władysław as a new King of Poland. While he had his disagreements with his father on certain political matters, he nevertheless offered him his help in governing the county of Łowicz and later he kept public support at astoundingly high levels during his father's rebellion. He may not be as conservative a carlist candidate for the throne, but he's a much safer option, as he's already well versed in warlord politics and can actually speak Polish."

POLITICS_KAROL_BURBON_DESC: "Carlos Javier Bernardo Sixto Marie prins de Bourbon de Parme is the current head of the House of Bourbon-Parma, as well a member of the Dutch Royal Family. His bloodline makes him a claimant of the long extinct Duchy of Parma and - according to Carlists - the Kingdom of Spain as well, and while it's unsurprising that he has made no real attempts to obtain neither of those thrones, absolutely noone expected him ending up being invited to rule a wartorn, Central European shithole. \n\nKarol Ksawery Burbon-Parmeński - as those moonrunes-speaking locals call him - has been declared by the Legitimist Regency Council of Poland to be the monarch of their soon-to-be united kingdom. Not accustomed to the brutal reality of post-Fall Poland and unable to communicate with his new subjects, Karol tries his hardest to hide his wishes of abstinence from politics and ruling as a purely symbolic monarch away from the monarchists in charge who see him as the only force able to cleanse Poland of its imperfections and lack of virtue. Unable to pull off a Henryk Walezy, the only option left for him is to clench his teeth, muster up some strength and give Poland what she wants - a Catholic ruler worth following into battle for their country"

KAR_masks_on: "Keeping our Masks on"
KAR_masks_on_desc: "Duke Jacek Bartyzel is in a particular predicament. He wants to uphold the organic, catholic, legitimist order on his lands as well as hold influence on the court of the Grand Duke, whose deteriorating mind will only accept an etiquette based on the world created for his books. This is problematic on many levels. The travels are highly restricted so as not to have spies report to Sapkowski about Łowicz's heresy. The Skierniewice diplomats and traders are directed towards specially built villages and fairs to keep the façade of ideological compliance. In turn, Bartyzel's own diplomats have to play like jesters at Sapkowski's court, causing much discontent among their ranks. "
KAR_proud_locals: "Proud Locals"
KAR_proud_locals_desc: "Right now, the vast majority of Księżaks (lit. the Duchy Inhabitants) are thankful that the Duchy of Łowicz, which they consider to be a vice-capital of Poland, is once again on maps, even as a dependent polity. They are willing to support most of Duke's policies as well as fight for what they consider to be the native lands of the Duchy. But as the times go by, they may become restless about the lack of achievements and expansion, realising the domain of Bartyzel doesn't control even the pre-Fall Łowicz province, not to mention the whole territory of the old Duchy that once controlled Skierniewice, not the other way around."
KAR_grand_duke_march: "The Grand Duke's March"
KAR_grand_duke_march_desc: "Its existence, as humble as it is, Łowicz owes to a promise made to the Grand Duke. It's a promise of the efficient mobilization and organization of levies and protection of the rims of Ellander. Despite his intellectual and not administrative or military background, Duke Jacek does whatever he can to fulfil his vassal contract. If he fails at his task, Sapkowski may at any time enter with his army to Łowicz and end the Duchy's autonomy, effectively obliterating Bartyzel's cause before it even had a chance to properly start."

unification.184.t: "[GetNewspaper]Duchy of Łowicz unifies Łódź Voivodeship!"
unification.184.desc: "Hiding from the spotlight behind Andrzej Sapkowski's forces during the initial phase of the Łódź standoff, Jacek Bartyzel now emerges as the local hegemon. Beginning his rise to power by declaring his support for the most powerful monarchical faction in voivodeship - the Grand Duchy of Ellander, Bartyzel endured Sapkowski's excesses, slowly building support for his cause. While most of the Grand Duke's subjects accepted the oddities resulting from his growing inability to differentiate fantasy from reality, many of them drew the line when he introduced a series of laws they interpreted as leftist and progressive. This situation provided an excellent opportunity for the Carlists, who quickly stabbed their suzerain in the back and defeated him in a rebellion. Now, as the regent of the Kingdom of Poland, Bartyzel purified the realm from the Witcher ideology and began establishing a radically right-wing regime emphasizing the importance of traditionalist Catholicism and integral monarchism."

super_b.5.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished.

As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
