unification.132.t: "[GetNewspaper]Bieszczady Free Republic unifies Subcarpathia!"
unification.132.desc: "A blast from the past for some, the Free Bieszczady Republic has seen quite the resurgence since the Fall, KSU seems to be back in style in Subcarpathia, as they’ve managed the seemingly insurmountable task of uniting the greater region of Subcarpathia. Having accomplished their goal of liberating an independent Subcarpathia, it is not known what plans the Punk Republic has in store for the rest of Poland. Eugeniusz Olejarczyk, the de facto leader of the Republic, has already announced that KSU will be going on tour all around Subcarpathia, which will end in a grand concert in the city of Ustrzyki Dolne meant to unveil their new yet to be released album. Invitations packed with VIP passes have also reportedly been sent out to leaders of other relatively stable regions. Time will tell who will show up, though one thing is clear, the Punks are here to stay."
unification.132.a: "Rock on!"
