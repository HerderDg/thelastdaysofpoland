unification.26.t: "[GetNewspaper]Duchy of Beuthen unifies Upper Silesia!"
unification.26.desc: "The past never lets go. Not quite. The German history of Silesia is very rich, and therefore very nostalgic for the descendants of those expelled from these lands. But also the current inhabitants of Silesia relate with unknown sympathy to the past, when the Germans ruled in Silesia and brought order and stability.\n\nThis can be seen, for example, in the case of Bytom and Count von Schaffgotsch, who, adored by his subordinates - both Polish, Silesian and German, took over the entire Upper Silesia for ownership, and now many descendants of landowners and entrepreneurs return to their rightful lands. Will Poles once again play the role of colonial slaves exploited by German capital? Not necessarily, because the count is a very popular ruler in these lands, and definitely more popular than any Polish ruler so far."
unification.26.a: "Schlesien is Deutsch!"

super.26.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.26.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.26.a: "United at last."
