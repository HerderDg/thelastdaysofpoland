POLITICS_ZBIGNIEW_ZIOBRO_DESC:0 "Zbigniew Ziobro could, perhaps, claim he is both the Law and the Justice. Although pursuing a legal career, his thirst for power predisposed him to participate in politics of an ever greater scale. His ambition and cunning made him one of the leading figures of the ruling camp – a political capital that he eagerly drew upon amidst the direst crisis. \n\nOnce rebellions sprung up in the south of Poland, Ziobro was sent out to crush them. It might have been a ploy to drive him away from the capital and dispatch him, as his forces were hardly suited for combat. Regardless of that, Ziobro was too smart to let himself be thrown out of the game he played for the last 20 years. He managed his army carefully enough to secure a large chunk of Poland for himself. Having granted some appanages to his most loyal vassals, he turned out to rooting dissent in his domain. This hasn’t been going well so far. \n\nWhile no one would deny his talents, it seems that people just won’t give Ziobro due respect, and this seems to be a trait of his personality prevalent at least since he’s been famously equated to a zero by Leszek Miller. While he’s a solid contender for reunification and holds some legitimacy, only the staunchest legalists could stomach supporting him out of conviction. As for now, the claim for IV Republic laid by Ziobro rests on force alone, and it is quite likely that overdosing this measure will end it. Time will tell, if Ziobro manages to hold fast and prove that he’s worth much more than most would think."

ziobro.1.desc:0 "Dark shadows loom over Holy Cross Mountains as Prosecutorship's authorities in Kielce have proclaimed they are in full control over the voivodeship once more. Amidst heavy fighting Ziobro's forces entered Starachowice and Sandomierz, overwhelming Combinate and Republic's militias, and thus brining an end to all so-called liberal dissention. \n\nAs purges are conducted in recaptured counties, rumours are coming in that relocation of forces to the northern front, as well as heavy casualties sustained during combat, have brought yet another wave of unrest, this time both among the population and armed forces of the Prosecutorship. It is expected that both rebellious cities will serve as examples to those unwilling to submit to Ziobro's will."

ziobro.2.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Ziobro Fails to Subjugate Northern Counties"
ziobro.2.desc:0 "Uplifting news come from Kielce as the city falls into chaos following Starachowice and Sandomierz successful defiance of the Prosecutor's authority. As Ziobro's forces are shattered, his grip over the whole region is dramatically loosened. Unrest seems out of control and there are rumours emerging about paramilitaries' commanders refusing to follow further orders. \n\nIt is widely believed Ziobro has little to no control over the whole situation and will try to save his sorry ass."
ziobro.2.a:0 "The clock hand goes backwards."

ziobro.3.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Holy Cross Moutains Uprising"
ziobro.3.desc:0 "Despite Ziobro's best efforts, the unrest in his lands has proved to large to be contained. Nationalist paramilitaries have seceded from his forces and opened fire on those sent in to negotiate. Communists and socialists took control over Starachowice, and there are rumours of a libertarian militias setting up in the south. In Sandomierz, a popular uprising has elected a priest to lead and protect the city. And, well, whatever the hell has appeared in the southwest, even we would not wish Ziobro to meet them. \n\nDespite radical differences between them, the rebels do not attack each other, as they are largely focused on fighting a common enemy - atleast for now. Ziobro was last seen running to Lesser Poland to establish safe operational base in there; if he acts quick, he might stamp out the rebels before they overrun his domain completely."
ziobro.3.a:0 "The Prosecutor, prosecuted."

ziobro.4.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Holy Cross Mountains Uprising"
ziobro.4.desc:0 "The realm of Ziobro is shattered as both paramilitaries and population reject his authority en masse following a humiliating defeat while trying to subjugate the Northern Counties of the voivodeship. \nNationalist paramilitaries have seceded from Ziobro's forces and took control over northwestern parts of the voivodeship. Communists and socialists took control over Starachowice, and there are rumours of libertarian militias overtaking the south. In Sandomierz, a popular uprising has overthrown Sienkiewicz and elected Fr. Mateusz Żmigrodzki as the protector of the city. And, well... whoever has appeared in the southwest, even we would not wish Ziobro to meet him. \nFor now, the rebels do not attack each other, as they are largely focused on fighting a common enemy. Ziobro was last seen running to Lesser Poland to establish a safe operational base in there; given the strength of the uprising, it is quite likely he'll have to stay there for a bit longer than he initially expected."
