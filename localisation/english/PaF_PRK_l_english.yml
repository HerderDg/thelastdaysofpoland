POLITICS_ZBIGNIEW_ZIOBRO_DESC:0 "Zbigniew Ziobro could, perhaps, claim he is both the Law and the Justice. Although pursuing a legal career, his thirst for power predisposed him to participate in politics of an ever greater scale. His ambition and cunning made him one of the leading figures of the ruling camp – a political capital that he eagerly drew upon amidst the direst crisis. \n\nOnce rebellions sprung up in the south of Poland, Ziobro was sent out to crush them. It might have been a ploy to drive him away from the capital and dispatch him, as his forces were hardly suited for combat. Regardless of that, Ziobro was too smart to let himself be thrown out of the game he played for the last 20 years. He managed his army carefully enough to secure a large chunk of Poland for himself. Having granted some appanages to his most loyal vassals, he turned out to rooting dissent in his domain. This hasn’t been going well so far. \n\nWhile no one would deny his talents, it seems that people just won’t give Ziobro due respect, and this seems to be a trait of his personality prevalent at least since he’s been famously equated to a zero by Leszek Miller. While he’s a solid contender for reunification and holds some legitimacy, only the staunchest legalists could stomach supporting him out of conviction. As for now, the claim for IV Republic laid by Ziobro rests on force alone, and it is quite likely that overdosing this measure will end it. Time will tell, if Ziobro manages to hold fast and prove that he’s worth much more than most would think."
