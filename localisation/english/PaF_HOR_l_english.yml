procesja.3.t: "[GetNewspaper]Eternal Procession Sets Off"
procesja.3.desc: "The congregation of pilgrims from all over Poland, which came to Włocławek to protect the body of Pope John Paul II, decided to leave the unstable region of Kujawy plagued by the political cold war and go to even more dangerous territory.\n\nTheir goal is to recapture Wadowice from the hands of the communist barbarians who now desacrate these holy grounds. The Eternal Procession, as the people called it, is made up of believers of all kinds, from the lowest classes to the military, to politicians and the higher clergy. It is led by the former deputy marshal on behalf of Law and Justice, Ryszard Terlecki, who himself looks as if he could jump into a coffin in any second.\n\nThe road ahead is long, full of threats, and the procession must additionally protect the Pope's body. And above all, one does not simply walk into Wadowice ..."
procesja.3.a: "Godspeed!"
procesja.3.b: "What the f..."
 
procesja_west.1.t: "Eternal Procession approaches the Consortium"
procesja_west.1.desc: "Dear board of the Flower Consortium - Ryszard Terlecki began with a monotonous and seemingly bored voice - The Holy Procession needs to pass through your lands to rescue the body of Saint John Paul II from the hands of the vile communists. If the money you possess hasn't wiped away your conscience, then you'll know our cause is just.\n The entirety of the board was listening to the announcement thanks to a live broadcast from the border guard post nearest to the pilgrims.\n - Such imperitinence - Wesołowska complained.\n - Can't we just shoot'em? - Rutkowski asked.\n - Ah, a fellow corpse enthusiast - Ebrantil whispered with admiration, yet apparently not quietly enough, as the others quickly gave him a suspicious look. Luckily for him, they ultimately decided to ignore his behavior. \n- Sounds profitable. - Skrzydlewski decided to break the awkward silence.\n - Father, you can't just let those fanatics roam all over our territory, no matter how much they are willing to pay for it. And I don't think they can even pay that much."
procesja_west.1.a: "Pay up, Terlecki"
procesja_west.1.b: "Get those zealots out of my sight"
 
procesja_west.4.t: "Eternal Procession approaches the Scouts"
procesja_west.4.desc: "When the Procession came the Scouts were, as always, prepared. The reconnaissance they carried out allowed them to come up with potential topics of discussion. They didn't expect Terlecki would just demand the right to pass. And mock them.\n- Scouts! I've been told you've strayed from the path of Christ, but your new gods couldn't have poisoned the mind of every person under your jurisdiction. And I call to scoutmaster Duda to remember his past allegiances and let the poor pilgrims pass so they can honor the Polish Pope."
procesja_west.4.a: "The conservatives need to be appeased"
procesja_west.4.b: "We will not tolerate these impertinents"
 
unification.142.t: "[GetNewspaper]Eternal Procession unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.142.desc: "Setting out from Włocławek, singing prayers and praises to God, the procession embarked on a great voyage through a war torn Poland. Braving the dangers that lurk around every corner, traversing the lands of many warlords who graciously granted them passage, the Eternal Procession arrived at their destination, only to find it swarming with bandits, in a state of anarchy worse than the one they left. At the sight of Sodom and Gomorrah incarnate, their mission gained a new purpose; They needed to bring order and the word of God to these chaotic lands. And so they did. Mustering their strength, they slain the Bandits of Skawina, freeing the peoples from their oppression and reclaimed the lands of Lesser Poland, gracing them with their divine guidance. All rejoice in Kraków, Wadowice and all across the reunified Voivodeship as they pour their hearts into Eternal Prayer. For those gathered before the altars one thing is certain..."
unification.142.a: "...The Procession must go on."
