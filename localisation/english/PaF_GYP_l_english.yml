GYP_tancowanie: "Khelel Roma!"
GYP_tancowanie_desc: "War is a savage, traumatic ordeal. For some, it is best to ignore it entirely. While the country bleeds itself to death in an unending series of conflicts, betrayals, and collapses, the towns of Ciechocinek and Aleksandrów calm their minds with something far more pleasant. Here, life is akin to a never-ending festival, directed by a minority hated everywhere but in this quiet haven, where it has found its place, providing cheap entertainment to the Poles who'd rather look the other way than face the reality their nation has found itself in. Eventually, the chaos will come for them, too. For now, they'd just rather not think about it."

GYP_kurorty: "Diplomatic Haven"
GYP_kurorty_desc: "The Saline Graduation Towers of Ciechocinek helped turn an otherwise unremarkable city into a spa town renowned all across the region. Thanks to the area's relative stability, many travellers still risk crossing the border to spend even a few hours in one of the many available resorts and find some reprieve for their daily troubles. Politicians, dignitaries, businessmen... elites representing each of the Kuyavian warlords put their differences aside and walk the streets of Ciechocinek in peace. As such, the city plays an important role in facilitating diplomacy and understanding in the voivodeship. If agreements can't be brokered here, they can't be brokered anywhere."
