WML_sphere_of_dialogue:0 "Sphere of Dialogue"
WML_sphere_of_dialogue_desc:0 "Thanks to the reverance regional warlords hold for Łódź, the free city became a sole island of peace, commerce and free exchange of ides among the sea of violence. But as a price for the neutrality, the republic must not expand it's miitary so as to not aggrevate it's neighbours."
WML_baluty_radiation:0 "Bałuty Radiation"
WML_baluty_radiation_desc:0 "As much effort as the Łódź government makes trying to improve the standard of living in the city, it simply lacks resources to deal with the radiation that emanates from the uninhabitable Zone still pollutes the Łódź center, resulting in the highest rates of cancer in the region."
WML_den_of_decadence:0 "Den of Decadence"
WML_den_of_decadence_desc:0 "A massive urban center and peaceful foreign policy caused many people to visit Łódź to relax and forget about traumating events. Here the visitors engage in the consumption mimicking and sometimes surpassing the pre-Fall one."

WML_fragile_denial_of_reality_desc:0 "§tFree city of Łódź stays in constant denial of situation they are in. They live and treat life exactly like it was in 2010-19, unaware of horror behind their city state. If this ilusion was ever to break, consequences would be horribly bad.§!"

 ####NATIONAL FOCUS####
 WML_new_morning_in_old_lodz:0 "New Morning in Old Łódź"
 WML_new_morning_in_old_lodz_desc:0 "Sun rises again - and this time it's not artificial. Rubble has been cleared, most of the victims buried and the zone delimited. Now Łódź looks as good as ever, although in this case the bar was set exceptionally low. With the most pressing matters dealt with, we can move on to solve further problems. This will be our first step on the road to regional reconstruction."
 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial:0 "A look behind the Curtains"
 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial_desc:0 "Though some people in Łódź would still atribute rising food prices to inflation caused by government's social programs and high cancer rates to 5G transmitters, the ugly truth is we're in a much worse place than we would like to think we are. Nationwide collapse of society is a domino effect and sooner or later it will affect us. We should send out emissaries and conduct spying operations beyond our borders to find out what is happening in our region and check for every possibility to avert imminent shortage of resources. As long as we make the right decisions quickly, the social order won't hopefully turn upside down."
 WML_energy_issues:0 "Energy Issues"
 WML_energy_issues_desc:0 "Each day we're tethering on the brink of total blackout. Most of our power grid always has been old and decrepit, and it's serviced by those few power plants that are currently under our control. Łódź is the light shining in darkness (not just because it's radioactive), and it can't go off. We must discuss possibilities of supplying additional energy."
 WML_food_shortages:0 "Food Shortage"
 WML_food_shortages_desc:0 "Famine isn't a word said out loud in Łódź, although the situation is getting dire enough. Some people started to use toothpaste as an appetizer with vodka and that's an ONZ approved indicator of a humanitarian crisis. There is little place to grow food in the city, so if we wish to avoid the shortage spiralling out of control, we might have to reach out to our neighbors for help."
 WML_lack_of_materials:0 "Lack of Materials"
 WML_lack_of_materials_desc:0 "The demand for raw materials exerted by every production centre is, in our case, mostly unmet. Our factories and workshops are empty and market supply comprises mostly of scavenged or found second-hand products. This puts health and safety of our populace in great risk, as well as threatens to pull off any semblance of normal-functioning market out of our economy. Resuming trade is of utmost importance."
 WML_city_will_hold_on:0 "City will Survive"
 WML_city_will_hold_on_desc:0 "We have found a way to meet every basic need of our society. Although the balance is fragile, at the present there is nothing more we can do. Everything else will be fixed in time with further implementation of the power of the Dialogue."
 WML_the_beginning_of_the_dialogue: "Dialogue begins"
 WML_the_beginning_of_the_dialogue_desc: "'No more blood spilt in Łódź' - that is the well known motto of Szymon Hołownia. Our president is determined to end the chaos in voivodeship with the least number of casualties possible. To do so, he's ready to implement numerous concessions to various factions and the negotiations are about to begin."
 WML_election_of_vice_president: "Elections of the vice-president"
 WML_election_of_vice_president_desc: "Managing all those ridiculous warlods is a formidable task indeed. One that, can't be done alone. As much as he may not like it Hołownia will have to share power with vice-president. He may choose from plethora of various candidates who are lobbied by the surrounding factions."

unification.1.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Free City of Łódź unifies Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.1.desc:0 "Ever since the tragic accident in Bałuty, it seemed like most of the past Łódź Voivodeship was doomed to spiral into insanity, with various ideologically outlandish cliques securing both large swaths of land and large followings in the region. The victor in the region, however, was the government of tbe City of Łódź, and a balanced, diplomatic approach won in the end. Today, Szymon Hołownia - the head of Łódź's government and the mediator in diplomatic talks concerning the Bałuty incident - proclaimed that all of Łódź Voivodeship has been united under a single flag. The newly born state aims to become a fully democratic republic that takes every citizen's opinion and worldview into account. This highly diplomatic and centrist approach made most local and international observers dismiss the City of Łódź as a noble, but doomed to fail state. Now that Hołownia united the whole voivodeship, however, the republic's neighbours start preparing their best orators to engage the state of Łódź on the diplomatic battlefield."
unification.1.a:0 "Is Dialogue a form of radical centrism?"

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_SZYMON_HOLOWNIA_DESC:0 "Szymon Hołownia (born 3 September 1976) is a Polish journalist, politician, television personality, writer, political commentator and humanitarian activist. From 2008 to 2019 he co-hosted Mam talent!, the Polish version of Got Talent, together with Marcin Prokop. He was an independent presidential candidate in 2020 elections, coming in third place in the first round of the elections. Terrified of the complete degradation of Poland, he escaped to Łódź, which was relatively far away from most of the chaos in the country. Known for his diplomatic approach, he was invited by the warring factions of Łódź as a mediator in the talks and the main overseer of the joint Łodzian investigation searching for answers on who and what caused the nuclear explosion in Bałuty."
