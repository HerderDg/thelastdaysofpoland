WML_sphere_of_dialogue_desc:0 "Thanks to the reverence the regional warlords hold for Łódź, the free city became the sole island of peace, commerce and free exchange of ideas among the sea of violence. But as a price for her neutrality, the republic must not expand its military so as to not aggravate its neighbors."

WML_baluty_radiation_desc:0 "As much effort as the Łódź government puts into trying to improve the standard of living in the city, it simply lacks resources to deal with the radiation that emanates from the uninhabitable Zone that still pollutes the city’s central regions, resulting in the highest rates of cancer ever seen in Poland"

WML_den_of_decadence_desc:0 "A massive urban center and peaceful foreign policy caused many people to visit Łódź to relax and forget about the traumatic events outside of our saving graces.

 WML_new_morning_in_old_lodz_desc:0 "The sun rises again - and this time it's not artificial. Rubble has been cleared, most of the victims buried and the zone made off limits. Now Łódź looks as good as ever, although in this case the bar was set exceptionally low. With the most pressing matters dealt with, we can move on to solving further problems. This will be our first step on the road to regional reconstruction."
 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial:0 "A Peek Behind the Curtains"
 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial_desc:0 "Though some people in Łódź would still attribute the rising food prices to inflation caused by government's social programs and high cancer rates thanks to 5G transmitters, the ugly truth is we're in a much worse place than we would like to think we are. Nationwide collapse of society is a domino effect and sooner or later it will affect us. We should send out emissaries and conduct spying operations beyond our borders to find out what is happening in our region and check for every possibility to avert imminent shortages of resources. As long as we make the right decisions quickly, the social order hopefully won’t be turned upside down."
 WML_energy_issues:0 "Energy Issues"
 WML_energy_issues_desc:0 "Each day we're teetering on the brink of total blackout. Most of our power grid has always been old and decrepit, and it's serviced by those few power plants that are currently under our control. Łódź is the light shining in the darkness (not just because it's radioactive), and it can't go dark. We must discuss possibilities of supplying additional energy."
 WML_food_shortages:0 "Food Shortage"
 WML_food_shortages_desc:0 "Famine isn't a word said out loud in Łódź, although the situation is getting dire enough. Some people started to use toothpaste as an appetizer with vodka and that's an ONZ approved indicator of a humanitarian crisis. There is little place to grow food in the city, so if we wish to avoid the shortage spiraling out of control, we might have to reach out to our neighbors for help."
 WML_lack_of_materials:0 "Lack of Materials"
 WML_lack_of_materials_desc:0 "The demand for raw materials exerted by every production center is, in our case, mostly unmet. Our factories and workshops are empty and our market’s supply mainly comprises scavenged or found second-hand products. This puts the health and safety of our populace at great risk, as well as threatens to pull off any semblance of a normal-functioning market out of our economy. Resuming trade is of utmost importance."
 WML_city_will_hold_on:0 "The City will Survive"
 WML_city_will_hold_on_desc:0 "We have found a way to meet every basic need of our society. Although the balance is fragile, at the present there is nothing more we can do. Everything else will be fixed in time with further implementation of the power of the Dialogue."

 WML_the_beginning_of_the_dialogue_desc:0 "'No more blood spilt in Łódź' - that is the well known motto of Szymon Hołownia. Our president is determined to end the chaos in our voivodeship with the least number of casualties possible. To do so, he's ready to implement numerous concessions to various factions. Let the negotiations begin!"
 WML_striking_workers:0 "Striking Workers"
 WML_striking_workers_desc:0 "Rising prices, decreasing quality of life, slacking social security and crippling lack of supplies all contribute to huge unrest among the working population of Łódź – and the tradition of lackluster workers’ rights enforcement in Pre-Fall Poland certainly did not help. We risk another 1905, but this time the revolution is quite likely to succeed. Dialogue is the way to solve this problem, but we must apply it with utmost care, lest we wish to spark the powder keg..."
 WML_minuscule_civil_guard:0 "Minuscule Civil Protection"
 WML_minuscule_civil_guard_desc:0 "With no delusions of making Łódź a safe city, we should nonetheless strive to make it as secure and stable as possible. With Polish Police practically disintegrated, the City Guard tried to stand up to this task – with predictable results. The formation is incompetent, yes, but first of all – understaffed and thinned out. As a result, crime is rampant, law goes unenforced, and our authority is a joke. For now, we need as many boots on the ground as we can get; quantity is a quality of its own."
 WML_election_of_vice_president:0 "Vice-Presidential Elections"
 WML_election_of_vice_president_desc:0 "Managing all those ridiculous warlords is a formidable task indeed. One that can't be done alone. As much as he may not like it, Hołownia will have to share power with a vice-president. He may choose from a plethora of various candidates who are being lobbied by the surrounding factions."
 WML_incomplete_compromise:0 "Incomplete Compromise"
 WML_incomplete_compromise_desc:0 "Despite Hołownia’s best efforts, it has become clear that  war in the Voivodeship is unavoidable. Only a small alliance with two factions at best will prove to be manageable in the long term. The power of Dialogue has been proven just as fragile as everyone had expected it to be. At least it wasn’t all for nothing in the end."
 WML_industrial_lodz:0 "Łódź Among Factories"
 WML_industrial_lodz_desc: "The Brotherhood of Coal is the most reasonable candidate for an ally. With their military and industrial might, they guarantee a swift military victory in the coming conflict. A victory that the alliance with the senile writer and some boys in shorts wouldn't bring."
 WML_forest_lodz:0 "Łódź Among Trees"
 WML_forest_lodz_desc:0 "To put things bluntly: Łódź is the only REAL city in an area. Most of the terrain in the Voivodeships is one big forest with some rural areas sprinkled about. For that sort of environment the Scout’s rough and tumble lifestyle, and expertise in guerilla warfare will prove invaluable to a victory against the region’s other powers."
 WML_lodz_industry:0 "Industrial Łódź"
 WML_lodz_industry_desc:0 "The Brotherhood is an ever churning machine and if we wish to keep up with it we must rapidly expand our industrial potential. We’ll cut down parks and forests sick with the Bałutian plague and old rundown hovels to march onwards into the future. We’ll build great modern factories never before seen in Łódź, by pulling inspiration from Ziemkiewicz’s “Common Sense”."
 WML_renovation_of_lask_airport:0 "Renovating the Łask Airport"
 WML_renovation_of_lask_airport_desc:0 "As a token of our appreciation we have decided to help out the Brotherhood by renovating the air force base in the city of Łask. Their workers are somewhat unsurprisingly very overstretched, with their ethos of breakneck industrialisation acting like a vacuum for skilled engineers, a void we can fill with some of our own. This would not only be seen as a great act of kindness on our part, but it would also supply our alliance with a fully operational airport ready for all of our military uses."
 WML_state_positions_for_the_power_plant_staff:0 "Employment for Engineers"
 WML_state_positions_for_the_power_plant_staff_desc:0 "Industrial planners from the Brotherhood have reached out to us with a suggestion to a perceived problem they’ve noticed within our industrial sector. They claim we should employ even more engineers at our workplaces as we are apparently not operating at full capacity. While we’ve considered our production methods to be perfect as is, their helpful tip has really opened our eyes to how much potential we’re wasting by not putting more boots on the ground. This may however upset some of our current workers, as a more crowded workspace and new colleagues with less practice put into their work may not make the most pleasant work environment.\n\nThey’ll get used to it eventually."

We have come up with a solution to this issue however; there is a whole lot of unused space, or run down buildings that could be turned into new beautiful parks. This would without a doubt not only make our new partners very happy, but it would also pull eyes away from the sore thumb that’s the Bałuty Exclusion Zone."
 WML_scout_commandos:0 "Scout Commandos"
 WML_scout_commandos_desc:0 "The ruthless upbringing and training routine in the Scouts’ ranks has caused them to be highly disciplined and skilled soldiers. We could adapt some of their methods to better teach our own Commandos how things are done. Ontop of that, older scouts could be integrated into our Special Forces' ranks as leaders and teachers."
 WML_spartan_standards:0 "Spartan Standards"
 WML_spartan_standards_desc:0 "As with our army, we must implement rigor and discipline into the lives of our population. We cannot enable the spread of cancerous decadence through our state’s body. Facing reality and adapting our lives to the issues facing us after the Fall instead of pretending that Poland never fell apart around must be our top priority, no matter how harsh the means."
 WML_lily_agents:0 "Gray Lily Agents"
 WML_lily_agents_desc:0 "Let’s face it, the City Guard that enforces our authority is more than incompetent. A sweeping reform of its apparatus is a possibility, however it would be a time-consuming and very costly endeavor given its current state. The Scouts however have reached out to us with a proposal. They suggest we allow their Gray Lilies to operate within our territories. This elite rank of enforcers, while harsh and even considered oppressive by some, if given a less authoritarian makeover will do wonders in replacing our current defunct system."
 WML_fantastical_lodz:0 "Łódź Among Elves"
 WML_fantastical_lodz_desc:0 "Duke Andrzej may not have as many forces as the other militaristic factions, but his influence and popularity simply cannot go unnoticed. Thanks to his works (and games that were based on them) he gained world-wide fame and taking a slice of that fame for ourselves would surely help with our public opinion and our men’s morale."

 WML.1.t:0 "The Little Things"
 WML.1.desc:0 "It was the little things in Łódź that made guests smile. \n\nThe rattling and screeching of the trams, filled with bored people looking into their smartphones. \n\nCars in a traffic jam on a narrow street, honking, driven by people looking dead inside. \n\nA reactivated vagina-shaped fountain, bubbling ceaselessly and splashing water, much to the joy of children walking by it to preschool, much to the embarrassment of their caretakers. \n\nFull tables in bars and restaurants, people chattering carelessly while sharing foods and drinks. \n\nThose rushing to work – and sporting some wear formal enough to make the onlooker sure they weren't *just* office workers, but office professionals. \n\nJuvenile delinquents with enough decency left to resort to enjoying beer on a nice afternoon. \n\nA vague demonstration in front of city hall, consisting of one art school girl, two of her friends, her how-do-you-do-fellow-kids aunt and that one basement-dwelling guy who heard about it on the internet and thought there'd be a show. \n\nSeen through the eyes of a native, these images could seem superficial and banal. But a visitor from other parts of the Polish Anarchy, having seen the city simply functioning, with its blood pumping and breathing palpable, could not help but wish they could spend some more time in that freeze-frame of an early 2020s (para)documentary."

 WML.2.desc:0 "The opulent halls of Łódź City Hall were silent. Gil-Piątek pulled back the curtains and smiled upon a handful of protesters outside. Hołownia combed his hair in front of the mirror, while Lubnauer looked at both of them nervously. \n– You’re sure this is a good idea? \nSzymon’s smile appeared in the mirror. \n– That’s just a few kids. Nothing wrong is going to happen, besides, we might get some nice publicity and free bottom-level feedback. Invite them inside and ask if they’d like some tea or coffee. \n\nOnce the protesters came in, Hołownia seated them behind a round table. \n– I’d like to welcome you at Łódź City Hall. Please state your demands and we might come to an agreement. \nThe organizer was anxious for a second, but then she started explaining something incoherently about rights of same sex couples to marry and how they were opressed and bullied in the schools. \n– Maybe you could talk with the schoolmistress – suggested Hołownia, feeling rather uneasy about making any political statements. – That way you could start the change in your own environment and then... \n– Oh, it won’t work – interrupted the organizer. – The bullies are in the gang, and they have a deal with… \n– Wait, what gang? \n– The amphetamine one – answered the girl. – That’s kinda sensible of the schoolmistress. I mean bills and food prices are rising every day, but... \n–But why would you produce amphetamine? \n– Erm, I guess crystal meth is more profitable, but this one is monopolised by... \n– No, why would you produce drugs at all? – cried Hołownia. \n– What else could we do, work? – a boy in a dirty hoodie with some face on it joined the conversation. – Everything is closing, and those jobs that remain are so poorly paid there’s no point in... \n– That’s true – interrupted the organizer. – In our school, ever since Ms. Mycielska and Ms. Dzierzgoń were diagnosed with pancreas cancer, there is no one willing to step in, and... \n\nA Few hours later, the conversation was over. Hołownia was left alone behind the table, covering the bottom of his face with his hands."

 WML.4.desc:0 "– To put it bluntly, Mr President, we’re in deep shit – said the engineer, wiping sweat off his forehead. – Each day number of flats disconnected from electricity grows exponentially, and we can only be happy spring’s coming and days are getting longer. Most of public venues already use emergency generators. Price of fuel grows with each day. Yesterday I’ve had to scrap off the floor seven guys. Six of them, they tried to leech off the grid on their own, and the seventh – electrician's face turned pale – installed makeshift water turbine in his toilet. It’s only a matter of days until some bloke from the Faculty of Physics builds a nuclear reactor and we'll have to deal with another Zone. \n\n– Couldn’t we just have a sincere talk with them how dangerous it is? – asked Hołownia. Katarzyna Lubnauer shook her head. \n– We can’t let people know how bad things really are. We either act and tell them what’s the solution right now, or... \n– But do we really know the solution? – Szymon rolled his eyes. \n\n– This electric palace I see in front of me is the Łódź oldest power plant – Tomasz Zimoch actually looked into Hołownia’s eyes, but it didn’t matter  – its chimneys, like high masts of a majestic sailing ship, will carry us out of this storm, and you, you Mr President, you will be the captain, the one to bring power like Prometheus brough fire to miserable Greeks... \n\n– Mr. Zimoch, if you please – Marek Belka interrupted – why would we try to bring old, decrepit power plants back to life, when we can easily make a deal with the Brotherhood? They have enough coal, and, thus, enough energy to fulfill all our needs. \n\nHołownia pondered for a while. \n– Fly, fly Adaś, fly over the atomic debris! – shouted Zimoch."

 WML.5.desc:0 "– They don’t even care anymore in the Chinese place – sighed Lubnauer, putting bags filled with takeout boxes on the table. Famished by hours of debates, Hołownia reached quickly to the bag, grabbed the first box and dug into fried rice with a plastic fork. Sharp and somewhat putrid smell filled the hall. \n– What’s this? – asked Belka, lifting his box up to sniff the contents and see it closely. \n– Fried rice with pigeon – Lubnauer replied. In a silent room, a single slow and loud gulp could be heard, followed by coughing. \n\n– I’m so glad I’m vegan – said Gil-Piątkowska, taking her box out of the bag. – Why would anyone buy this shit in the first place? \n– This is the last Chinese bar in the city that did not rise prices – replied Lubnauer. – And the line was atrocious. That’s the only semblance of the old food people can afford. \n– It  d o e s  taste similar – Hołownia remarked. – Guess we should’ve put the line when kebabs stopped pretending the lamb was actually beef. \n– Hadn’t we got any other food options? – asked Belka. \n– It’s for the envoy – replied Lubnauer, as a large, quite hairy and quite smelly individual entered the room. \n\n– Oh shit, a Chinese – exclaimed the neckbeard, stomping towards the table. – None of these survived in Eliander. Anyways – he continued with his mouth full – we could supply you with some fresh produce from our estates. You know, meat, milk, mead, some grains and veggies, so on. \n– Maybe we’ve got some alternatives... – Hołownia muttered, looking at the numerous flock of pigeons behind the window. \n– Yeah, coal, matzah or pinecones – replied the neckbeard. – You’ll be better off with us. Although, judging by this, there’s nothing wrong with your food..."

 WML.6.desc:0 "– It’s not like the industry fared really great before, I must admit – Marek Belka pointed at a piechart of dubious quality, made most likely just to give anything to point at – but right now, when we could and should become industrial powerhouse in this shithole of a country, it all went into dumps. As an isolated urban area, we’ve travelled back to the times of cottage industry and 90’s unemployment simultaneously. We can’t build new houses without scavenging in the rubbles, we can’t print books without recycling the old ones, we can’t service our army, our public institutions, our... \n\n– I get the point – Hołownia interrupted. – Why we aren’t importing anything yet? Won’t any of our neighbors like to make a profit? \n\n– Balance of power – replied Lubnauer. – We’ll pick one, the other’s not gonna like it. They’ll think we’re plotting against them. \n\n– Well then, we shall invite them both to Łódź to settle their differences, and voila! We’re gonna live in a prosperous, democratic society in no time. \n\n – But first – Belka cut in – we have to pick one. Otherwise, in the worst case, we’ll be eaten by the jobless, and in the best, our guests will have to use leaves instead of toilet paper. \n\n– Mayyybe this isn’t the worst idea – said Gil-Piątek. – With the amount of rubble and scrap material in Łódź there’s really no need to ask anyone for help. Not at least at the cost of antagonising a dangerous enemy. We wouldn’t really like to get on the Consortium’s or the Jews’ bad side, right? And we could create new jobs in the scavenging and recycling sector. \n\nBelka scoffed. Lubnauer looked sceptic, but turned expectantly to Hołownia."

POLITICS_SZYMON_HOLOWNIA_DESC:0 "Leaving safe and comfortable work show bussiness has not been an easy decision, but Szymon Hołownia has knew since 2020 that the escalating polarization in Polish society would lead to its downfall and he had to do something about it, as it would seem the largest political parties were only encouraging the animosities to grow. He may have known that prolonging the 'Polish-Polish war' would end tragically, but even he couldn't forsee the scale of the 2025 collapse.\n After the Fall, he tried his luck organising people in his native Podlasie, but was soon expulsed by the deranged local warlords. Trying to find most fertile land for him to introduce his ideas, he eventually came to Łódź voivodeship. In his eyes the collective memory of Bałuty Tragedy could serve as a backbone for a sense unity unseen in Poland since 1989, if the local factions will be eager to see the things that they have in common.\nDetermined, well-mannered and reasonable, many believe Szymon Hołownia will be the one to successfully bring balance to the voivodeship."
