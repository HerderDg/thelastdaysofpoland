WML_sphere_of_dialogue_desc:0 "Thanks to the reverence the regional warlords hold for Łódź, the free city became the sole island of peace, commerce and free exchange of ideas among the sea of violence. But as a price for her neutrality, the republic must not expand its military so as to not aggravate its neighbors."
WML_baluty_radiation:0 "Bałuty Radiation"
WML_baluty_radiation_desc:0 "As much effort as the Łódź government puts into trying to improve the standard of living in the city, it simply lacks resources to deal with the radiation that emanates from the uninhabitable Zone that still pollutes the city’s central regions, resulting in the highest rates of cancer ever seen in Poland"
WML_den_of_decadence:0 "Den of Decadence"
WML_den_of_decadence_desc:0 "A massive urban center and peaceful foreign policy caused many people to visit Łódź to relax and forget about the traumatic events outside of our saving graces. Here the visitors engage in pleasures that mimic and sometimes surpass the luxuries of the city before the Fall."

WML_fragile_denial_of_reality_desc:0 "§tThe free city of Łódź stays in constant denial of the situation they are in. They live and treat life exactly like it was in 2010-19, unaware of the horrors outside of their city state. If this illusion was ever to break, the consequences would be horrendous.§!"

 ####NATIONAL FOCUS####
 WML_new_morning_in_old_lodz:0 "New Morning in Old Łódź"
 WML_new_morning_in_old_lodz_desc:0 "The sun rises again - and this time it's not artificial. Rubble has been cleared, most of the victims buried and the zone made off limits. Now Łódź looks as good as ever, although in this case the bar was set exceptionally low. With the most pressing matters dealt with, we can move on to solving further problems. This will be our first step on the road to regional reconstruction."
 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial:0 "A peek behind the Curtains"
 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial_desc:0 "Though some people in Łódź would still attribute the rising food prices to inflation caused by government's social programs and high cancer rates thanks to 5G transmitters, the ugly truth is we're in a much worse place than we would like to think we are. Nationwide collapse of society is a domino effect and sooner or later it will affect us. We should send out emissaries and conduct spying operations beyond our borders to find out what is happening in our region and check for every possibility to avert imminent shortages of resources. As long as we make the right decisions quickly, the social order hopefully won’t be turned upside down."
 WML_energy_issues:0 "Energy Issues"
 WML_energy_issues_desc:0 "Each day we're teetering on the brink of total blackout. Most of our power grid has always been old and decrepit, and it's serviced by those few power plants that are currently under our control. Łódź is the light shining in the darkness (not just because it's radioactive), and it can't go dark. We must discuss possibilities of supplying additional energy."
 WML_food_shortages:0 "Food Shortage"
 WML_food_shortages_desc:0 "Famine isn't a word said out loud in Łódź, although the situation is getting dire enough. Some people started to use toothpaste as an appetizer with vodka and that's an ONZ approved indicator of a humanitarian crisis. There is little place to grow food in the city, so if we wish to avoid the shortage spiraling out of control, we might have to reach out to our neighbors for help."
 WML_lack_of_materials:0 "Lack of Materials"
 WML_lack_of_materials_desc:0 "The demand for raw materials exerted by every production center is, in our case, mostly unmet. Our factories and workshops are empty and our market’s supply mainly comprises scavenged or found second-hand products. This puts the health and safety of our populace at great risk, as well as threatens to pull off any semblance of a normal-functioning market out of our economy. Resuming trade is of utmost importance."
 WML_city_will_hold_on:0 "The City will Survive"
 WML_city_will_hold_on_desc:0 "We have found a way to meet every basic need of our society. Although the balance is fragile, at the present there is nothing more we can do. Everything else will be fixed in time with further implementation of the power of the Dialogue."
 WML_the_beginning_of_the_dialogue:0 "The Dialogue begins"
 WML_the_beginning_of_the_dialogue_desc:0 "'No more blood spilt in Łódź' - that is the well known motto of Szymon Hołownia. Our president is determined to end the chaos in our voivodeship with the least number of casualties possible. To do so, he's ready to implement numerous concessions to various factions. Let the negotiations begin!"
 WML_striking_workers:0 "Striking workers"
 WML_striking_workers_desc:0 "Rising prices, decreasing life quality, lacking social security and crippling lack of supplies all contribute to huge unrest among working population – and the tradition of lackluster workers’ rights enforcement in pre-impact Poland certainly did not help. We risk another year 1905, but this time the revolution is quite likely to succeed. The Dialogue is the way to solve this problem, but we must apply it with utmost carefulness, lest we’ll spark the powder keg..."
 WML_minuscule_civil_guard:0 "Minuscule civil guard"
 WML_minuscule_civil_guard_desc:0 "With no delusions of making Łódź a safe city, we should nonetheless strive to make it as secure and stable as possible. With Polish Police disintegrated, the City Guard tried to stand up to this task – with predictable results. The formation is incompetent, yes, but first of all – understaffed and thinned out. As a result, crime is rampant, law is nonenforced, and our authority’s a joke. For now, we need as many boots on the floor as we can get; the quantity is a quality of its own."
 WML_election_of_vice_president:0 "Vice-Presidential Elections"
 WML_election_of_vice_president_desc:0 "Managing all those ridiculous warlords is a formidable task indeed. One that can't be done alone. As much as he may not like it, Hołownia will have to share power with a vice-president. He may choose from a plethora of various candidates who are being lobbied by the surrounding factions."

 WML.4.t:0 "Searching for an Energy Source"
 WML.4.desc:0 "– To put it bluntly, Mr President, we’re in deep shit – said the engineer, wiping sweat off his forehead. – Each day number of flats disconnected from electricity grows exponentially, and we can only be happy spring’s coming and days are getting longer. Most of public venues already use emergency generators. Price of fuel grows with each day. Yesterday I’ve had to scrap off the floor seven guys. Six of them, they tried to leech off the grid on their own, and the seventh – electrician's face turned pale – installed makeshift water turbine in his toilet. It’s only a matter of days until some bloke from the Faculty of Physics builds a nuclear reactor and we'll have to deal with another Zone. \n\n– Couldn’t we just have a sincere talk with them how dangerous it is? – asked Hołownia. Katarzyna Lubnauer shook her head. \n– We can’t let people know how bad things really are. We either act and tell them what’s the solution right now, or... \n– But do we really know the solution? – Szymon rolled his eyes. \n\n– This electric palace I see in front of me is the Łódź oldest power plant – Tomasz Zimoch actually looked into Hołownia’s eyes, but it didn’t matter  – its chimneys, like high masts of a majestic sailing ship, will carry us out of this storm, and you, you Mr President, you will be the captain, the one to bring power like Prometheus brough fire to miserable Greeks... \n\n– Mr. Zimoch, if you please – Marek Belka interrupted – why would we try to bring old, decrepit power plants back to life, when we can easily make a deal with the Brotherhood? They have enough coal, and, thus, enough energy to fulfill all our needs. \n\nHołownia pondered for a while. \n– Fly, fly Adaś, fly over the atomic debris! – shouted Zimoch."
 WML.4.a:0 "The Brotherhood is probably the best option."
 WML.5.t:0 "In search of a Food Supplier"
 WML.5.desc:0 "– They don’t even care anymore in the Chinese place – sighed Lubnauer, putting bags filled with takeout boxes on the table. Famished by hours of debates, Hołownia reached quickly to the bag, grabbed the first box and dug into fried rice with a plastic fork. Sharp and somewhat putrid smell filled the hall. \n– What’s this? – asked Belka, lifting his box up to sniff the contents and see it closely. n\– Fried rice with pigeon – Lubnauer replied. In a silent room, a single slow and loud gulp could be heard, followed by coughing. \n\n– I’m so glad I’m vegan – said Gil-Piątkowska, taking her box out of the bag. – Why would anyone buy this shit in the first place? \n– This is the last Chinese bar in the city that did not rise prices – replied Lubnauer. – And the line was atrocious. That’s the only semblance of the old food people can afford. \n– It  d o e s  taste similar – Hołownia remarked. – Guess we should’ve put the line when kebabs stopped pretending the lamb was actually beef. \n– Hadn’t we got any other food options? – asked Belka. \n– It’s for the envoy – replied Lubnauer, as a large, quite hairy and quite smelly individual entered the room. \n\n– Oh shit, a Chinese – exclaimed the neckbeard, stomping towards the table. – None of these survived in Eliander. Anyways – he continued with his mouth full – we could supply you with some fresh produce from our estates. You know, meat, milk, mead, some grains and veggies, so on. \n– Maybe we’ve got some alternatives... – Hołownia muttered, looking at the numerous flock of pigeons behind the window. \n– Yeah, coal, matzah or pinecones – replied the neckbeard. – You’ll be better off with us. Although, judging by this, there’s nothing wrong with your food..."
 WML.5.a:0 "Maybe the Duke will toss us a coin?"
 WML.6.t:0 "The Search for Raw Materials"
 WML.6.desc:0 "– It’s not like the industry fared really great before, I must admit – Marek Belka pointed at a piechart of dubious quality, made most likely just to give anything to point at – but right now, when we could and should become industrial powerhouse in this shithole of a country, it all went into dumps. As an isolated urban area, we’ve travelled back to the times of cottage industry and 90’s unemployment simultaneously. We can’t build new houses without scavenging in the rubbles, we can’t print books without recycling the old ones, we can’t service our army, our public institutions, our... \n\n– I get the point – Hołownia interrupted. – Why we aren’t importing anything yet? Won’t any of our neighbors like to make a profit? \n\n– Balance of power – replied Lubnauer. – We’ll pick one, the other’s not gonna like it. They’ll think we’re plotting against them. \n\n– Well then, we shall invite them both to Łódź to settle their differences, and voila! We’re gonna live in a prosperous, democratic society in no time. \n\n – But first – Belka cut in – we have to pick one. Otherwise, in the worst case, we’ll be eaten by the jobless, and in the best, our guests will have to use leaves instead of toilet paper. \n\n– Mayyybe this isn’t the worst idea – said Gil-Piątek. – With the amount of rubble and scrap material in Łódź there’s really no need to ask anyone for help. Not at least at the cost of antagonising a dangerous enemy. We wouldn’t really like to get on the Consortium’s or the Jews’ bad side, right? And we could create new jobs in the scavenging and recycling sector. \n\nBelka scoffed. Lubnauer looked sceptic, but turned expectantly to Hołownia."

 WML.7.desc:0 "Ever since the tragic accident in Bałuty, it seemed like most of the past Łódź Voivodeship was doomed to spiral into insanity, with various ideologically outlandish cliques securing both large swaths of land and large followings in the region. The victor in the region, however, was the government of the City of Łódź, and its balanced, diplomatic approach won in the end. Today, Szymon Hołownia - the head of the Łódź government and the mediator in diplomatic talks concerning the Bałuty incident - proclaimed that all of Łódź Voivodeship has been united under a single flag. The newly born state aims to become a fully democratic republic that takes every citizen's opinion and worldview into account. This highly diplomatic and centrist approach made most local and international observers dismiss the City of Łódź as a noble state, however one that was destined to fail. Now that Hołownia united the whole voivodeship, however, the republic's neighbors have started preparing their best orators to engage the state of Łódź on the diplomatic battlefield."

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_SZYMON_HOLOWNIA_DESC:0 "Leaving safe and comfortable work show bussiness has not been an easy decision, but Szymon Hołownia has knew since 2020 that the escalating polarization in Polish society would lead to its downfall and he had to do something about it, as it would seem the largest political parties were only encouraging the animosities to grow. He may have known that prolonging the 'Polish-Polish war' would end tragically, but even he couldn't forsee the scale of the 2025 collapse.\n After the Fall, he tried his luck organising people in his native Podlasie, but was soon expulsed by the deranged local warlords. Trying to find most fertile land for him to introduce his ideas, he eventually came to Łódź voivodeship. In his eyes the collective memory of Bałuty Tragedy could serve as a backbone for a sense unity unseen in Poland since 1989, if the local factions will be eager to see the things that they have in common.\nDetermined, well-mannered and reasonable, many believe Szymon Hołownia will be the one to successfully bring balance to the voivodeship."
