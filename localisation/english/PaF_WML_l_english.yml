unification.1.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Free City of Łódź unifies Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.1.desc:0 "Ever since the tragic accident in Bałuty, it seemed like most of the past Łódź Voivodeship was doomed to spiral into insanity, with various ideologically outlandish cliques securing both large swaths of land and large followings in the region. The victor in the region, however, was the government of tbe City of Łódź, and a balanced, diplomatic approach won in the end. Today, Szymon Hołownia - the head of Łódź's government and the mediator in diplomatic talks concerning the Bałuty incident - proclaimed that all of Łódź Voivodeship has been united under a single flag. The newly born state aims to become a fully democratic republic that takes every citizen's opinion and worldview into account. This highly diplomatic and centrist approach made most local and international observers dismiss the City of Łódź as a noble, but doomed to fail state. Now that Hołownia united the whole voivodeship, however, the republic's neighbours start preparing their best orators to engage the state of Łódź on the diplomatic battlefield."

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_SZYMON_HOLOWNIA_DESC:0 "Szymon Hołownia (born 3 September 1976) is a Polish journalist, politician, television personality, writer, political commentator and humanitarian activist. From 2008 to 2019 he co-hosted Mam talent!, the Polish version of Got Talent, together with Marcin Prokop. He was an independent presidential candidate in 2020 elections, coming in third place in the first round of the elections. Terrified of the complete degradation of Poland, he escaped to Łódź, which was relatively far away from most of the chaos in the country. Known for his diplomatic approach, he was invited by the warring factions of Łódź as a mediator in the talks and the main overseer of the joint Łodzian investigation searching for answers on who and what caused the nuclear explosion in Bałuty."
