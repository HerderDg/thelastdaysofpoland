WML_sphere_of_dialogue:0 "Sphere of Dialogue"
WML_sphere_of_dialogue_desc:0 "Thanks to the reverence the regional warlords hold for Łódź, the free city became the sole island of peace, commerce and free exchange of ideas among the sea of violence. But as a price for her neutrality, the republic must not expand its military so as to not aggravate its neighbors."
WML_baluty_radiation:0 "Bałuty Radiation"
WML_baluty_radiation_desc:0 "As much effort as the Łódź government puts into trying to improve the standard of living in the city, it simply lacks resources to deal with the radiation that emanates from the uninhabitable Zone that still pollutes the city’s central regions, resulting in the highest rates of cancer ever seen in Poland"
WML_den_of_decadence:0 "Den of Decadence"
WML_den_of_decadence_desc:0 "A massive urban center and peaceful foreign policy caused many people to visit Łódź to relax and forget about the traumatic events outside of our saving graces. Here the visitors engage in pleasures that mimic and sometimes surpass the luxuries of the city before the Fall."

WML_fragile_denial_of_reality:0 "Fragile Ilusion of Normality"
WML_fragile_denial_of_reality_desc:0 "The free city of Łódź stays in comfortable denial of situation they're in. They live and treat life exactly like it was in 2010-19 or even 2023-2025, unaware of the horrors outside of their city state borders.§t If this comfortable illusion was ever to break, the consequences would be Catastrophic!§!"
WML_brotherhood_energy_reliance:0 "Łódź-Brotherhood Energy Deal"
WML_brotherhood_energy_reliance_desc:0 "§RWe have become almost fully reliant on Brotherhood's energy network, if something bad happened we would have a serious blackout. It's a massive security concern and a possible political leverage.§!"
WML_duchy_food_reliance:0 "Łódź-Duchy Food Deal"
WML_duchy_food_reliance_desc:0 "§RFrom now on, our country is almost fuly dependent on Duchies of Ellander food supply, it's a great deal for us but, it grants Duchy a great tool of political pressure on us, which might hurt if we end up in bad relations with them.§!"
WML_consortium_material_reliance:0 "Łódź-Consortium Material's Deal"
WML_consortium_material_reliance_desc:0 "§YWith signing this deal, we have become completely monopolised in terms of material and resource deliveries into our beloved city. It's not as bad as it seems, as Consortium's people are professional and smart society, able to take care of this responsibility.§!"

 ####5 PROBLEMÓW FOCUSY####

 WML_new_morning_in_old_lodz:0 "New Morning in Old Łódź"
 WML_new_morning_in_old_lodz_desc:0 "The sun rises again - and this time it's not artificial. Rubble has been cleared, most of the victims buried and the zone made off limits. Now Łódź looks as good as ever, although in this case the bar was set exceptionally low. With the most pressing matters dealt with, we can move on to solving further problems. This will be our first step on the road to regional reconstruction."
 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial:0 "A Peek Behind the Curtains..."
 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial_desc:0 "Though some people in Łódź would still attribute the rising food prices to inflation caused by government's social programs and high cancer rates thanks to 5G transmitters, the ugly truth is we're in a much worse place than we would like to think we are. Nationwide collapse of society is a domino effect and sooner or later it will affect us. We should send out emissaries and conduct spying operations beyond our borders to find out what is happening in our region and check for every possibility to avert imminent shortages of resources. As long as we make the right decisions quickly, the social order hopefully won’t be turned upside down."
 WML_energy_issues:0 "Energy Issues"
 WML_energy_issues_desc:0 "Each day we're teetering on the brink of total blackout. Most of our power grid has always been old and decrepit, and it's serviced by those few power plants that are currently under our control. Łódź is the light shining in the darkness (not just because it's radioactive), and it can't go dark. We must discuss possibilities of supplying additional energy."
 WML_food_shortages:0 "Food Shortage"
 WML_food_shortages_desc:0 "Famine isn't a word said out loud in Łódź, although the situation is getting dire enough. Some people started to use toothpaste as an appetizer with vodka and that's an ONZ approved indicator of a humanitarian crisis. There is little place to grow food in the city, so if we wish to avoid the shortage spiraling out of control, we might have to reach out to our neighbors for help."
 WML_lack_of_materials:0 "Lack of Materials"
 WML_lack_of_materials_desc:0 "The demand for raw materials exerted by every production center is, in our case, mostly unmet. Our factories and workshops are empty and our market’s supply mainly comprises scavenged or found second-hand products. This puts the health and safety of our populace at great risk, as well as threatens to pull off any semblance of a normal-functioning market out of our economy. Resuming trade is of utmost importance."
 WML_city_will_hold_on:0 "The City will Survive"
 WML_city_will_hold_on_desc:0 "We have found a way to meet every basic need of our society. Although the balance is fragile, at the present there is nothing more we can do. Everything else will be fixed in time with further implementation of the power of the Dialogue."
 WML_striking_workers:0 "Striking Workers"
 WML_striking_workers_desc:0 "Rising prices, decreasing quality of life, slacking social security and crippling lack of supplies all contribute to huge unrest among the working population of Łódź – and the tradition of lackluster workers’ rights enforcement in Pre-Fall Poland certainly did not help. We risk another 1905, but this time the revolution is quite likely to succeed. Dialogue is the way to solve this problem, but we must apply it with utmost care, lest we wish to spark the powder keg..."
 WML_minuscule_civil_guard:0 "Minuscule Civil Protection"
 WML_minuscule_civil_guard_desc:0 "With no delusions of making Łódź a safe city, we should nonetheless strive to make it as secure and stable as possible. With Polish Police practically disintegrated, the City Guard tried to stand up to this task – with predictable results. The formation is incompetent, yes, but first of all – understaffed and thinned out. As a result, crime is rampant, law goes unenforced, and our authority is a joke. For now, we need as many boots on the ground as we can get; quantity is a quality of its own."
 WML_and_a_look_onto_the_stage:0 "...And a look onto the Stage"
 WML_and_a_look_onto_the_stage_desc:0 "We may talk, we may assure, we may dance the same dance of Wyspiański’s Wedding, but we are not blind to our problems. Unlike our populace, that are our faithful dance partners, they are blissfully ignorant to just how bad things really are. This dance must go round and round until we manage to solve these issues.\n\nIf we break the tempo, well, let’s not dwell on that too much..."
 WML_hungry_and_lost:0 "Hungry and Lost"
 WML_hungry_and_lost_desc:0 "Our people may not realize it, but we are running almost exclusively on fumes, and even those are running out. Just about any basic resource a state would need, we do not have. Many of our shops and industrial facilities had to slow down work or completely go offline for the time being. We have to hurry up, the doomsday clock is ticking."
 WML_why_cant_we_just_agree:0 "Why Can't we Just Agree?"
 WML_why_cant_we_just_agree_desc:0 "Everyone in Łódź wants everything done their way. Those who see through the veil push for reform, those who don’t push through lines to get the last cup of coffee at their favorite coffee shop. Our job of keeping our citizen’s discontent to an absolute minimum is being stretched so thin, it is hard to take our eyes off of it. We have to fix the issues with the social side of our affairs, to at the very least, prevent protests breaking out in the streets."
 WML_sow_the_seeds_of_dialogue:0 "Sow the Seeds of Dialogue"
 WML_sow_the_seeds_of_dialogue_desc:0 "Not everyone in our government is on board with Hołownia’s Dialogue. It’s hard to blame them really, so far Łódź has been in a downward spiral, and now it is just barely keeping itself afloat. But surely enough, if we simply talk to those who don’t agree with our peaceful rhetoric, they will surely come around. And if they don’t then they’ll wish they had when they’re looking for a new job."

 ####DIALOG FOCUSY####

 WML_the_beginning_of_the_dialogue:0 "The Dialogue Begins"
 WML_the_beginning_of_the_dialogue_desc:0 "'No more blood spilled in Łódź' - that is the well known motto of Szymon Hołownia. Our president is determined to end the chaos in our voivodeship with the lowest number of casualties possible. To do so, he's ready to implement numerous concessions to various factions. Let the negotiations begin!"
 WML_election_of_vice_president: "Vice-Presidential Elections"
 WML_election_of_vice_president_desc:0 "Managing all those ridiculous warlords is a formidable task indeed. One that can't be accomplished alone. As much as he may not like it, Hołownia will have to share power with a vice-president. The warlords along with our own government have already put forward their “suggestions” for the position. We have the final say in the matter however, and whoever we pick will be eternally grateful to have such close ties with us."
 WML_send_out_delegations:0 "Send out Delegations"
 WML_send_out_delegations_desc:0 "If we actually want the warlords around us to talk to us, then we’ll have to reach out to them first. We’ll assemble delegations including our best politicians and send them on their way deep into the heartlands of our soon to be partners. Getting them to talk about anything beyond purely material gain will be tough at first, but they’ll come to talk in no time."
 WML_insider_perspective:0 "An Insider's Perspective"
 WML_insider_perspective_desc:0 "A team of delegates is purely not enough to see what makes the warlords tick, so we’ll send “economic advisors” over to their lands to poke around and gather valuable intel for us. A little bit of cloak-and-dagger never hurt anyone, and besides, who would ever suspect an advisor of spying on them?"
 WML_convene_general_assembly:0 "Convene the Łódzkie General Assembly"
 WML_convene_general_assembly_desc:0 "To expedite our negotiations with the warlords we have decided to push for the creation of a Council of delegates from each state. This group of five will reside in the capital district of Łódź to help speed up and simplify communication between our friends. A small drawback to this is that all the representatives will know about what we promise the others, possibly leading to some grievances."
 WML_industrial_lodz:0 "Łódź Among Factories"
 WML_industrial_lodz_desc: "The Brotherhood of Coal is one of the most reasonable candidates for an ally. With their military and industrial might, they guarantee a very powerful position in the Voivodeship, and maybe even in the other territories surrounding us. Something that prioritising the senile writer and some boys in shorts would not be able to accomplish in the short term."
 WML_forest_lodz:0 "Łódź Among Trees"
 WML_forest_lodz_desc:0 "To put things bluntly: Łódź is the only REAL city in an area. Most of the terrain in the Voivodeships is one big forest with some rural areas sprinkled about. In that sort of environment the Scout’s rough and tumble lifestyle, and expertise in guerilla warfare will prove an invaluable asset in case of any possible conflicts and disasters that might strike us."
 WML_lodz_industry:0 "Industrial Łódź"
 WML_lodz_industry_desc:0 "The Brotherhood is an ever churning machine and if we wish to keep up with it we must rapidly expand our industrial potential. We’ll cut down parks and forests sick with the Bałutian plague and old rundown hovels to march onwards into the future. We’ll build great modern factories never before seen in Łódź, by pulling inspiration from Ziemkiewicz’s “Common Sense”."
 WML_renovation_of_lask_airport:0 "Renovating the Łask Airport"
 WML_renovation_of_lask_airport_desc:0 "As a token of our appreciation we have decided to help out the Brotherhood by renovating the air force base in the city of Łask. Their workers are somewhat unsurprisingly very overstretched, with their ethos of breakneck industrialisation acting like a vacuum for skilled engineers, a void we can fill with some of our own. This would not only be seen as a great act of kindness on our part, but it would also supply our alliance with a fully operational airport ready for all of our military uses."
 WML_state_positions_for_the_power_plant_staff:0 "Employment for Engineers"
 WML_state_positions_for_the_power_plant_staff_desc:0 "Industrial planners from the Brotherhood have reached out to us with a suggestion to a perceived problem they’ve noticed within our industrial sector. They claim we should employ even more engineers at our workplaces as we are apparently not operating at full capacity. While we’ve considered our production methods to be perfect as is, their helpful tip has really opened our eyes to how much potential we’re wasting by not putting more boots on the ground. This may however upset some of our current workers, as a more crowded workspace and new colleagues with less practice put into their work may not make the most pleasant work environment.\n\nThey’ll get used to it eventually."
 WML_mining_in_lodz:0 "Future of Voivodeship Mines"
 WML_mining_in_lodz_desc:0 "Our voivodeship sits on a wealth of coal and other resources that we’re simply not mining fast and well enough. We’ve drawn up investment plans meant to modernize and expand our mines, using the cash we’ve gained from our recent industrial successes. This bounty of basic materials will fuel our rapidly expanding industry and surely give it the boost it needs to be the powerhouse our people expect it to be."
 WML_construction_of_parks:0 "Building Parks"
 WML_construction_of_parks_desc:0 "The Scout’s ideology claims that cities are unnatural and something that’s directly opposite to nature, which they love all so much. We have come up with a solution to this issue however; there is a whole lot of unused space, or run down buildings that could be turned into new beautiful parks. This would without a doubt not only make our new partners very happy, but it would also pull eyes away from the sore thumb that’s the Bałuty Exclusion Zone."
 WML_scout_commandos:0 "Scout Commandos"
 WML_scout_commandos_desc:0 "The ruthless upbringing and training routine in the Scouts’ ranks has caused them to be highly disciplined and skilled soldiers. We could adapt some of their methods to better teach our own Commandos how things are done. Ontop of that, older scouts could be integrated into our Special Forces' ranks as leaders and teachers."
 WML_spartan_standards:0 "Spartan Standards"
 WML_spartan_standards_desc:0 "As with our army, we must implement rigor and discipline into the lives of our population. We cannot enable the spread of cancerous decadence through our state’s body. Facing reality and adapting our lives to the issues facing us after the Fall instead of pretending that Poland never fell apart around must be our top priority, no matter how harsh the means."
 WML_lily_agents:0 "Gray Lily Agents"
 WML_lily_agents_desc:0 "Let’s face it, the City Guard that enforces our authority is more than incompetent. A sweeping reform of its apparatus is a possibility, however it would be a time-consuming and very costly endeavor given its current state. The Scouts however have reached out to us with a proposal. They suggest we allow their Gray Lilies to operate within our territories. This elite rank of enforcers, while harsh and even considered oppressive by some, if given a less authoritarian makeover will do wonders in replacing our current defunct system."
 WML_fantastical_lodz:0 "Łódź Among Elves"
 WML_fantastical_lodz_desc:0 "Duke Sapkowski may not have as many forces as the other militaristic factions, but his influence and popularity simply cannot go unnoticed. Thanks to his works (and games that were based on them) he gained world-wide fame and taking a slice of that fame for ourselves would surely help with our public opinion and our men’s morale."
 WML_ignacy_moscicki_potions_laboratory:0 "Ignacy Mościcki Potion Laboratories"
 WML_ignacy_moscicki_potions_laboratory_desc:0 "With most modern foodstuffs being filled with artificial ingredients and preservatives, it might be profitable to centralize chemical production for all industries in single-purpose factories. This also gives us the perfect opportunity to experiment with chemicals which are not usually employed in the food industry, and seek for the new generation of combat drugs fit for a modern battlefield. The health risks of whatever we concoct aren’t a top priority though."
 WML_wizardring_schools:0 "Wizarding Schools"
 WML_wizardring_schools_desc:0 "It is said any technology advanced enough is undistinguishable from magic... or maybe it's the other way. Anyway, it is about time we get back to education and start creating a new caste of elite thinkers and engineers with help of our new friends."
 WML_witcher_training:0 "Witcher Training"
 WML_witcher_training_desc:0 "We really would waste the naming potential if we didn't name our special forces Witchers. Truth be told, the only thing stopping us was the copyright. With Duke Andrzej's consent, we can freely go ahead calling our commandos Witchers, so long as they have some knightley flair. We’ll just give them a service saber or something."
 WML_support_of_landowners:0 "Supporting Landowners"
 WML_support_of_landowners_desc:0 "Landowners are vital for the survival of the farming industry, and we have to care for them appropriately, both economically and symbolically. With the help of right-wing Sapkowski's supporters, we will grant a number of legal concessions to the landowners that will help them develop their businesses. The traditionalists will also make sure the society will treat them with respect they are due for their labor."
 WML_fairer_lodz:0 "Łódź Among Zealots"
 WML_fairer_lodz_desc:0 "Devotion in a cause. The main driving force behind any ideal, the burning embers of fervor deep within someone. That’s one thing that the Hooligans of Widzew have more than enough of. Their unending belief in their crusade of sorts to reclaim Łódź is a great cause for concern. However, what if we let them in peacefully? They’ll reclaim their New Canaan, and we’ll gain a lot of favor with them, not to mention the aid of their zealous ranks of bat wielding roughnecks."
 WML_the_primacy_of_entrepreneurs:0 "Łódź Among Businessmen"
 WML_the_primacy_of_entrepreneurs_desc:0 "Krośniewice’s Triumvirate is simply swimming in money. Money which we’d be very glad to take a slice out of. While they’re not the most popular candidate, their financial power and close ties with the medical services make them a very alluring option, especially among the richer folks within our leadership. After all, their expertise in fields like medicine, investigation… and burials of all things, would make them a very useful partner."
 WML_the_rights_of_religious_minorities:0 "Rights for Religious Minorities"
 WML_the_rights_of_religious_minorities_desc:0 "Jews, Muslims, Protestants and everyone else exist within our country and there’s no denying it. A motion pushed forward by the Hooligans that meant to grant Judaism equal status to Catholicism has spiraled into a discussion about broader tolerance of faith within our state. When the dust settled, it seems that everyone had agreed to grant equal rights to all religions and beliefs within Łódź."
 WML_primacy_of_trade_unions:0 "Primacy of Trade Unions"
 WML_primacy_of_trade_unions_desc:0 "Trade Union presence in Łódzkie has been abnormally low just about everywhere. We see the issue with that, or well, saw when half of our workers held a general strike against us. To prevent such further issues, the Hooligans have reached out to us with an offer to help spread awareness of active unions and establish new ones where they were lacking."
 WML_co_-_financing_of_sports:0 "Grants for Sport Events"
 WML_co_-_financing_of_sports_desc:0 "The Hooligans love soccer. They love it above everything else and it can prove a very good bargaining chip in negotiations with them. If we invest some money into invigorating the sports industry in Łódź and especially in Old Widzew, we’d get a lot of favor from Rabbi and his crew of goons."
 WML_defenders_of_faith:0 "Defenders of Faith"
 WML_defenders_of_faith_desc:0 "While Rabbi might not have much to offer in terms of actual military capabilities, his “coaches” may very well serve as an often forgotten part of warfare: Chaplains. Their contribution to soldiers’ morale through sermons and kind words in trying times has been seen time and time again, even if they rarely get the credit for it. Our soldiers will thank us for having ones of our own to support them."
 WML_preferential_government_contracts:0 "Government Contracts"
 WML_preferential_government_contracts_desc:0 "Financial support granted to us by the Consortium has allowed us to sign some brand new contracts with weapons manufacturers. This will finally allow us to arm out troops with real, modern weapons. Our forces will look more like an actual army, instead of a bunch of reservists with one rifle and half a magazine for five men."
 WML_tax_breaks:0 "Tax Breaks"
 WML_tax_breaks_desc:0 "Business in our city won’t simply grow up and out of the cracks in the sidewalk on its own, that’s why we need to give it a helping hand. Lowering taxes will be like a flower pot full of fresh, well fertilized earth which will lead to the blooming of the beautiful blossoms of commerce all across Łódź. Soon we’ll have a whole bouquet of new companies and enterprises for our people to enjoy."
 WML_graves_of_an_unknown_soldier:0 "Graves of Unknown Soldiers"
 WML_graves_of_an_unknown_soldier_desc:0 "The return of the funeral home “H. Skrzydlewska” to Łódź has been a hidden boon, not only in a commercial sense, but also for uplifting the spirits of our citizens. They can bury their dead family members in a proper, ceremonial manner once again. Let’s just hope we have enough space in our graveyards."
 WML_private_security_agencies:0 "Private Security Agencies"
 WML_private_security_agencies_desc:0 "While the City Guard has been doing a... decent job, optimistically speaking, we need a gentler touch for cases that they’re simply not skilled enough for. We can’t expect a group of so-called officers who can barely dish out a parking ticket to actually catch a criminal that knows the basics of how to cover their tracks.For this exact reason we’ve decided to officially integrate Rutkowski’s agency into our law enforcement structure."

 WML_hold_great_conference: "Hold the Great Conference"

 WML_lodz_among_spokesmen_desc: "While the Dialogue is important, we cannot forget about our own interest. Łódź has many problems, more than the Five Problems that plagued us and we need to go about fixing or mitigating them in any way possible. There’s no rush though, after all if we play our cards right, the warlords will solve a big chunk of our problems for us."
 WML_hold_onto_normality_desc: "The illusion of normality we try our best to hold up is a  very fragile thing, and as times change, upkeeping it becomes a more and more strenuous task. Our latest overtures to the warlords have probably been one of the biggest strains on that illusion thus far. However, through some gentle web weaving and a few sensible explanations, we can simply frame these communications as a normal part of Post-Fall politics."
 WML_crackdown_on_consoomers_desc: "Łódź has long been called “The Den of Decadence” and its name is sadly not without merit. With people living like the Fall had never happened, telling them that some commodities are in short supply is practically impossible, with us having to operate within black markets behind their backs to get them their coveted bottle of wine from Bydgoszcz. This has to end, or we’ll become so reliant on the black market, it will barely be what it’s meant to be. Limiting some of the highest “luxuries” will be a step in the right direction."
 WML_pamper_delegations_desc: "Now, we want a good look for ourselves in the eyes of our soon to be allies and one way to do that is to get them to look at Łódź through rose tinted glasses. The other warlords’ representatives will be given the highest standard of living possible in our city, as if they weren’t getting it before. Free passes into spas, the best smuggled alcohol we have and just about anything else we can come up with to make their stay here as pleasant as possible. They’ll love it here, and hopefully they’ll recommend their experience to their peers."
 WML_ultimate_compromise_desc: "The balancing act we’ve been showing off to everyone has been interpreted in many different ways, a masterstroke of diplomacy, bootlicking and so on and so forth. Though few can deny its effectiveness. Through our inventiveness we have managed to accrue favors with just about everyone around us and it’s time to turn them in for real assurances of good terms between us."
 WML_send_final_letters_desc: "The Conference’s date is nearly upon us and there’s no time to wait. Letters and delegations have been sent. Soon we’ll see the fruits of our labor. We will prepare the finest reception for all the leaders, a banquet at the best restaurants, comfortable lodging in the most expensive hotels and any amenity they could imagine for the duration of their stay. We’re all crossing our fingers hoping for the best."
 WML_hold_great_conference_desc: "The day we have all been waiting for has come. The Great Conference. The fate of Łódzkie hangs in the balance as everyone completes the final preparations to host the other warlords’ heads’ of state and their ministers. We have come this far and we can’t afford to trip up now."

 ####INCOMPLETE COMPROMISE FOCUS TREE####

 WML_incomplete_compromise:0 "Incomplete Compromise"
 WML_incomplete_compromise_desc:0 "Despite Hołownia’s best efforts, it has become clear that  war in the Voivodeship is unavoidable. Only a small alliance with two factions at best will prove to be manageable in the long term. The power of Dialogue has been proven just as fragile as everyone had expected it to be.

 WML_total_dialogue:0 "Total Dialogue"
 WML_total_dialogue_desc:0 "We’ve done it!\n\nThanks to Szymon Hołownia’s best efforts we’ve managed to unite the Łódź Voivodeship under one banner. The sheer fact we’ve managed to reach a compromise between all the region’s factions is simply impossible to comprehend, however now before us lies another great issue; managing this shaky at best alliance. Our solution for this problem is very simple on paper, integrating the highly clashing ideologies of our new allies into our governance, however in reality finding common threads between these entirely different nations will be a very time consuming and difficult process."
 WML_system:0 "Łódź for All"
 WML_system_desc:0 "Finally, Łódź can return to being our region’s hotbed of democracy. All sorts of ideologies, ideals and ways of thought all in one place, not in strife but in relative harmony. People from every corner of our voivodeship fill our streets to the brim. Families and groups long separated have the chance to unite again, much like us and these warlords.\nIn the end, we’ve finally become friends with everyone."
 WML_economy:0 "Shared Economy"
 WML_economy_desc:0 "What’s the use in keeping our economies separate? If we are such great allies, then what’s stopping us from forming one united economic bloc. The might of our economy will be unlike any other. The Brotherhood’s immense industrial might, the Consortium’s unending wealth and the many workshops littering just about everywhere else will make us a true powerhouse among Poland’s squalor.\nWho could possibly stand up to us then?"
 WML_military:0 "Together for Victory"
 WML_military_desc:0 "Our armies will stand hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder together on the front, behind enemy lines and on the homefront. The Scouts’ guerilla warfare will wreak havoc behind enemy lines, the Hooligans’ Warrior-Rabbis will lift our men’s spirits, the Duke’s valiant knights will make a show of their prowess, striking fear into the hearts of our enemies just as hard as their steel will clash against their armor.\nAll together we will be indomitable!"

 WML.1.t:0 "The Little Things"
 WML.1.desc:0 "It was the little things in Łódź that made guests smile. \n\nThe rattling and screeching of the trams, filled with bored people looking into their smartphones. \n\nCars in a traffic jam on a narrow street, honking, driven by people looking dead inside. \n\nA reactivated vagina-shaped fountain, bubbling ceaselessly and splashing water, much to the joy of children walking by it to preschool, much to the embarrassment of their caretakers. \n\nFull tables in bars and restaurants, people chattering carelessly while sharing foods and drinks. \n\nThose rushing to work – and sporting some wear formal enough to make the onlooker sure they weren't *just* office workers, but office professionals. \n\nJuvenile delinquents with enough decency left to resort to enjoying beer on a nice afternoon. \n\nA vague demonstration in front of city hall, consisting of one art school girl, two of her friends, her how-do-you-do-fellow-kids aunt and that one basement-dwelling guy who heard about it on the internet and thought there'd be a show. \n\nSeen through the eyes of a native, these images could seem superficial and banal. But a visitor from other parts of the Polish Anarchy, having seen the city simply functioning, with its blood pumping and breathing palpable, could not help but wish they could spend some more time in that freeze-frame of an early 2020s (para)documentary."

 WML.2.t:0 "The Curtains of Denial"
 WML.2.desc:0 "The opulent halls of Łódź City Hall were silent. Gil-Piątek pulled back the curtains and smiled upon a handful of protesters outside. Hołownia combed his hair in front of the mirror, while Lubnauer looked at both of them nervously. \n– You’re sure this is a good idea? \nSzymon’s smile appeared in the mirror. \n– That’s just a few kids. Nothing wrong is going to happen, besides, we might get some nice publicity and free bottom-level feedback. Invite them inside and ask if they’d like some tea or coffee. \n\nOnce the protesters came in, Hołownia seated them behind a round table. \n– I’d like to welcome you at Łódź City Hall. Please state your demands and we might come to an agreement. \nThe organizer was anxious for a second, but then she started explaining something incoherently about rights of same sex couples to marry and how they were opressed and bullied in the schools. \n– Maybe you could talk with the schoolmistress – suggested Hołownia, feeling rather uneasy about making any political statements. – That way you could start the change in your own environment and then... \n– Oh, it won’t work – interrupted the organizer. – The bullies are in the gang, and they have a deal with… \n– Wait, what gang? \n– The amphetamine one – answered the girl. – That’s kinda sensible of the schoolmistress. I mean bills and food prices are rising every day, but... \n–But why would you produce amphetamine? \n– Erm, I guess crystal meth is more profitable, but this one is monopolised by... \n– No, why would you produce drugs at all? – cried Hołownia. \n– What else could we do, work? – a boy in a dirty hoodie with some face on it joined the conversation. – Everything is closing, and those jobs that remain are so poorly paid there’s no point in... \n– That’s true – interrupted the organizer. – In our school, ever since Ms. Mycielska and Ms. Dzierzgoń were diagnosed with pancreas cancer, there is no one willing to step in, and... \n\nA Few hours later, the conversation was over. Hołownia was left alone behind the table, covering the bottom of his face with his hands."

 WML.4.desc:0 "– To put it bluntly, Mr President, we’re in deep shit – said the engineer, wiping sweat off his forehead. – Each day number of flats disconnected from electricity grows exponentially, and we can only be happy spring’s coming and days are getting longer. Most of public venues already use emergency generators. Price of fuel grows with each day. Yesterday I’ve had to scrap off the floor seven guys. Six of them, they tried to leech off the grid on their own, and the seventh – electrician's face turned pale – installed makeshift water turbine in his toilet. It’s only a matter of days until some bloke from the Faculty of Physics builds a nuclear reactor and we'll have to deal with another Zone. \n\n– Couldn’t we just have a sincere talk with them how dangerous it is? – asked Hołownia. Katarzyna Lubnauer shook her head. \n– We can’t let people know how bad things really are. We either act and tell them what’s the solution right now, or... \n– But do we really know the solution? – Szymon rolled his eyes. \n\n– This electric palace I see in front of me is the Łódź oldest power plant – Tomasz Zimoch actually looked into Hołownia’s eyes, but it didn’t matter  – its chimneys, like high masts of a majestic sailing ship, will carry us out of this storm, and you, you Mr President, you will be the captain, the one to bring power like Prometheus brough fire to miserable Greeks... \n\n– Mr. Zimoch, if you please – Marek Belka interrupted – why would we try to bring old, decrepit power plants back to life, when we can easily make a deal with the Brotherhood? They have enough coal, and, thus, enough energy to fulfill all our needs. \n\nHołownia pondered for a while. \n– Fly, fly Adaś, fly over the atomic debris! – shouted Zimoch."
 WML.4.a:0 "The Brotherhood is probably the best option."
 WML.5.t:0 "In search of a Food Supplier"
 WML.5.desc:0 "– They don’t even care anymore in that Chinese place – sighed Lubnauer, putting bags filled with takeout boxes on the table. Famished by hours of debates, Hołownia reached quickly for the bag, grabbed the first box and dug into fried rice with a plastic fork. A Sharp and somewhat putrid smell filled the hall. \n– What’s this? – asked Belka, lifting his box up to sniff the contents and see it closely. \n– Fried rice with pigeon – Lubnauer replied. In a silent room, a single slow and loud gulp could be heard, followed by coughing. \n\n– I’m so glad I’m vegan – said Gil-Piątkowska, taking her box out of the bag. – Why would anyone buy this shit in the first place? \n– This is the last Chinese bar in the city that did not rise prices – replied Lubnauer. – And the line was atrocious. That’s the only semblance of the old food people can still afford. \n– It  d o e s  taste similar – Hołownia remarked. – Guess we should’ve drawn the line when kebabs stopped pretending the lamb was actually beef. \n– Haven’t we got any other food options? – asked Belka. \n– It’s for the envoy – replied Lubnauer, as a large, quite hairy and quite smelly individual entered the room. \n\n– Oh shit, Chinese takeout?! – exclaimed the neckbeard, stomping towards the table. – None of these survived in Ellander. Anyways – he continued with his mouth full – we could supply you with some fresh produce from our estates. You know, meat, milk, mead, some grains and veggies, so on. \n– Maybe we’ve got some alternatives... – Hołownia muttered, looking at the numerous flock of pigeons behind the window. \n– Yeah, coal, matzah or pinecones – replied the neckbeard. – You’ll be better off with us. Although, judging by this, there’s nothing wrong with your food..."

 WML.6.t:0 "The Search for Raw Materials"
 WML.6.desc:0 "–...It’s not like the industry fared any much better, I must admit – Marek Belka pointed at a pie chart of dubious quality, made most likely just as something to point at – but right now, when we could and should become an industrial powerhouse in this shithole of a country, all of that went straight into the dumpster. As an isolated urban area, we’ve traveled back to the times of cottage industry and 90’s unemployment simultaneously. We can’t build new houses without scavenging through the rubble, we can’t print books without recycling old ones, we can’t service our army, our public institutions, our… \n\n– I get the point – Hołownia interrupted. – Why aren't we importing anything yet? Won’t any of our neighbors like to make a profit? \n– These loonies are at eachother’s throats – replied Lubnauer. – We have to place our trust carefully and pick the most profitable and sensible option. Either way they’re gonna notice we trade with their enemies and we won’t gain shit. \n\n– Let’s discuss the possibilities, then – concluded Hołownia briskly, but the response wasn’t really enthusiastic. \n– There’s only one possibility here – said Belka resignedly. – The Consortium is the only statelet with an industrial base capable enough and appropriate attitude. We should contact them ASAP. \n\nHołownia’s eyes became glassy. – Why can’t we simply... just... get along with each other! – he cried. – It’s something we can all benefit from! They know it for sure! No matter how dumb or crazy they are! Even if they’d plan to kill us later, they just have to see that, for now, the Dialogue is the best solution! Just a moment of peace in this God forsaken pigsty of a country! Why they don’t understand? n\n\The room fell silent. Gil Piątek approached Hołownia and embraced him. \n– Don’t worry, Szymon. We’ll have enough time to fork them over. We’ll just have to wait for some things to unfold..."

President was willing to provide the lighting as the energy blackouts were ended thanks to the deal with the Brotherhood, but the IT specialists denied the offer. They said they prefer the lab the way it is.\nCome on, patch it up.

And it's done. The last click of enter silenced seemingly unending clicking. Ventilators had to continue to chill the machinery, but the difference in noise was still noticable.\nThirty minutes later Hołownia arrived at the lab.\nWelcome, Mr. President, we're pleased to visit you in the Main Govermental Computer Lab - Świętochowska welcomed the famed Mediator form Łódź - We are ready to turn Jaśmina on.\n - Thank you, professor Świętochowska  - If he was put of by the look and the closeness of the room, he could mask it very well. Or it he may have been to excited to be bothered - I would like to see the result of your work.\n - Certainly - she gave a signal to the part of the crew still siting at the computer to start the process. Ventilators started to spin faster rening the all to familiar noise. However, the giant monitor that was supposed to show the highlit of their project was still inactive. The light turned on especially for president's visits begun to flicker only to go off completely. Soon after the ventilators stopped as well. Five infinately long seconds of complete darkness passed.

She was *the* local safekeeper - mostly because there was no other authority to enforce abiding to the law.

Surely more city guards would make the not-really-black-but-darkish-grey market she'd just been to more annoying and expensive. However, as she was hauling her cart filled with groceries to home, a man in an once white, mud-stained tracksuit crossed her path. \n– Gimme 10 złoty or this crowbar's gonna sing Bad Boys Blue – he slurred, brandishing a rugged piece of iron. Basia noted the shaky movements, reached calmly to her purse and unloaded a shitton of teargas in the guy's eyes. \n\nUnfortunately, the madlad was high enough to become only enraged. He swung his crowbar violently, but while Basia evaded the hit and blocked his arms, in the subsequent clench she felt her strength waning. \n\n– Leave that lady, you thug! – someone cried in a pre-mutation voice. Basia saw the gleam of steel as a scout approached the attacker with his knife out and pulled his hood violently – to no avail. The thug wasn't shaken at all and turned back to see the scout visibly hesitant to actually stab someone. As he pulled back from the clench to punch the kid, Basia took the opportunity and strangled the crowbar from his hand. Seconds later, the thug was lying on the ground with his skull mauled. \n\n– Thank you, ma'am – muttered the scout, while Basia helped him to his feet. \n– The pleasure's mine, boy. But aren’t you a bit too young for guard duties? \n– They wouldn’t let me do the patrol – he answered, a bit flustered. – I was sent to Łódź to do some menial shit for our instructors. But that doesn’t mean I will leave someone without help! \n– Only you needed help there, lad! – answered Basia, laughing. At least now there was someone who cared."

 WML.21.desc:0 "Ms. Basia was well known in her neighborhood for two things: relentless monitoring of her yard's environs from her window and being a large, imposing person with an astonishing, if not mildly threatening aura. Over 1,8 meter tall and only a little less wide, she represented the type of elderly lady invulnerable to the Polish proverbial electrocuting. She was *the* local safekeeper - mostly because there was no other authority to enforce abiding to the law.

He swung his crowbar violently, but while Basia evaded the hit and blocked his arms, in the subsequent clench she felt her strength waning. As she became weaker and weaker, she shouted for help, but no one came. The last thing she remembered, falling, was the thug’s face as he swung a crowbar at her head. \n\n– Who the fuck is that supposed to be? – a bald, pug-nosed man walked into the gate where the thug, sitting on the pavement, rumbled among things found in the cart. \n– That’s some good shit inside – he answered, lifting up a blueberry cottage cheese. The bald man grasped his throat, pressed him against the wall and whispered into his ear. \n– The deal was simple. First of all, you aim for men walking out of the speakeasy. Not into it, and certainly not women. Second, I give you meth, you give me cash or valuables. Is this a valuable? – asked the bald man, nodding to the cottage cheese. – You’ve crossed the line, I’m afraid. \n\nThe policeman reached for a taser and pointed it right to the thug’s heart. No fucking party tonight, only paperwork."

unification.1.desc:0 "Ever since the tragic accident in Bałuty, it seemed like most of the past Łódź Voivodeship was doomed to spiral into insanity, with various ideologically outlandish cliques securing both large swaths of land and large followings in the region. The victor in the region, however, was the government of the City of Łódź, and its balanced, diplomatic approach won in the end. Today, Szymon Hołownia - the head of the Łódź government and the mediator in diplomatic talks concerning the Bałuty incident - proclaimed that all of Łódź Voivodeship has been united under a single flag. The newly born state aims to become a fully democratic republic that takes every citizen's opinion and worldview into account. This highly diplomatic and centrist approach made most local and international observers dismiss the City of Łódź as a noble state, however one that was destined to fail. Now that Hołownia united the whole voivodeship, however, the republic's neighbors have started preparing their best orators to engage the state of Łódź on the diplomatic battlefield."

POLITICS_SZYMON_HOLOWNIA_DESC:0 "Leaving safe and comfortable work show bussiness has not been an easy decision, but Szymon Hołownia has knew since 2020 that the escalating polarization in Polish society would lead to its downfall and he had to do something about it, as it would seem the largest political parties were only encouraging the animosities to grow. He may have known that prolonging the 'Polish-Polish war' would end tragically, but even he couldn't forsee the scale of the 2025 collapse.\n After the Fall, he tried his luck organising people in his native Podlasie, but was soon expulsed by the deranged local warlords. Trying to find most fertile land for him to introduce his ideas, he eventually came to Łódź voivodeship. In his eyes the collective memory of Bałuty Tragedy could serve as a backbone for a sense unity unseen in Poland since 1989, if the local factions will be eager to see the things that they have in common.\nDetermined, well-mannered and reasonable, many believe Szymon Hołownia will be the one to successfully bring balance to the voivodeship."
