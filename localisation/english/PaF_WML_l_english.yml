POLITICS_SZYMON_HOLOWNIA_DESC:0 "Szymon Hołownia (born 3 September 1976) is a Polish journalist, politician, television personality, writer, political commentator and humanitarian activist. From 2008 to 2019 he co-hosted Mam talent!, the Polish version of Got Talent, together with Marcin Prokop. He was an independent presidential candidate in 2020 elections, coming in third place in the first round of the elections. Terrified of the complete degradation of Poland, he escaped to Łódź, which was relatively far away from most of the chaos in the country. Known for his diplomatic approach, he was invited by the warring factions of Łódź as a mediator in the talks and the main overseer of the joint Łodzian investigation searching for answers on who and what caused the nuclear explosion in Bałuty."
