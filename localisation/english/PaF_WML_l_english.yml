WML_sphere_of_dialogue:0 "Sphere of Dialogue"
WML_sphere_of_dialogue_desc:0 "Thanks to the reverence the regional warlords hold for Łódź, the free city became the sole island of peace, commerce and free exchange of ideas among the sea of violence. But as a price for her neutrality, the republic must not expand its military so as to not aggravate its neighbors."
WML_baluty_radiation:0 "Bałuty Radiation"
WML_baluty_radiation_desc:0 "As much effort as the Łódź government puts into trying to improve the standard of living in the city, it simply lacks resources to deal with the radiation that emanates from the uninhabitable Zone that still pollutes the city’s central regions, resulting in the highest rates of cancer ever seen in Poland"
WML_den_of_decadence:0 "Den of Decadence"
WML_den_of_decadence_desc:0 "A massive urban center and peaceful foreign policy caused many people to visit Łódź to relax and forget about the traumatic events outside of our saving graces. Here the visitors engage in pleasures that mimic and sometimes surpass the luxuries of the city before the Fall."

WML_fragile_denial_of_reality:0 "Fragile Ilusion of Normality"
WML_fragile_denial_of_reality_desc:0 "§tThe free city of Łódź stays in constant denial of the situation they are in. They live and treat life exactly like it was in 2010-19, unaware of the horrors outside of their city state. If this illusion was ever to break, the consequences would be horrendous.§!"

 ####NATIONAL FOCUS####
 WML_new_morning_in_old_lodz:0 "New Morning in Old Łódź"
 WML_new_morning_in_old_lodz_desc:0 "The sun rises again - and this time it's not artificial. Rubble has been cleared, most of the victims buried and the zone made off limits. Now Łódź looks as good as ever, although in this case the bar was set exceptionally low. With the most pressing matters dealt with, we can move on to solving further problems. This will be our first step on the road to regional reconstruction."
 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial:0 "A peek behind the Curtains"
 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial_desc:0 "Though some people in Łódź would still attribute the rising food prices to inflation caused by government's social programs and high cancer rates thanks to 5G transmitters, the ugly truth is we're in a much worse place than we would like to think we are. Nationwide collapse of society is a domino effect and sooner or later it will affect us. We should send out emissaries and conduct spying operations beyond our borders to find out what is happening in our region and check for every possibility to avert imminent shortages of resources. As long as we make the right decisions quickly, the social order hopefully won’t be turned upside down."
 WML_energy_issues:0 "Energy Issues"
 WML_energy_issues_desc:0 "Each day we're teetering on the brink of total blackout. Most of our power grid has always been old and decrepit, and it's serviced by those few power plants that are currently under our control. Łódź is the light shining in the darkness (not just because it's radioactive), and it can't go dark. We must discuss possibilities of supplying additional energy."
 WML_food_shortages:0 "Food Shortage"
 WML_food_shortages_desc:0 "Famine isn't a word said out loud in Łódź, although the situation is getting dire enough. Some people started to use toothpaste as an appetizer with vodka and that's an ONZ approved indicator of a humanitarian crisis. There is little place to grow food in the city, so if we wish to avoid the shortage spiraling out of control, we might have to reach out to our neighbors for help."
 WML_lack_of_materials:0 "Lack of Materials"
 WML_lack_of_materials_desc:0 "The demand for raw materials exerted by every production center is, in our case, mostly unmet. Our factories and workshops are empty and our market’s supply mainly comprises scavenged or found second-hand products. This puts the health and safety of our populace at great risk, as well as threatens to pull off any semblance of a normal-functioning market out of our economy. Resuming trade is of utmost importance."
 WML_city_will_hold_on:0 "The City will Survive"
 WML_city_will_hold_on_desc:0 "We have found a way to meet every basic need of our society. Although the balance is fragile, at the present there is nothing more we can do. Everything else will be fixed in time with further implementation of the power of the Dialogue."
 WML_the_beginning_of_the_dialogue:0 "The Dialogue begins"
 WML_the_beginning_of_the_dialogue_desc:0 "'No more blood spilt in Łódź' - that is the well known motto of Szymon Hołownia. Our president is determined to end the chaos in our voivodeship with the least number of casualties possible. To do so, he's ready to implement numerous concessions to various factions. Let the negotiations begin!"
 WML_election_of_vice_president:0 "Vice-Presidential Elections"
 WML_election_of_vice_president_desc:0 "Managing all those ridiculous warlords is a formidable task indeed. One that can't be done alone. As much as he may not like it, Hołownia will have to share power with a vice-president. He may choose from a plethora of various candidates who are being lobbied by the surrounding factions."

unification.1.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Free City of Łódź unifies Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.1.desc:0 "Ever since the tragic accident in Bałuty, it seemed like most of the past Łódź Voivodeship was doomed to spiral into insanity, with various ideologically outlandish cliques securing both large swaths of land and large followings in the region. The victor in the region, however, was the government of the City of Łódź, and its balanced, diplomatic approach won in the end. Today, Szymon Hołownia - the head of the Łódź government and the mediator in diplomatic talks concerning the Bałuty incident - proclaimed that all of Łódź Voivodeship has been united under a single flag. The newly born state aims to become a fully democratic republic that takes every citizen's opinion and worldview into account. This highly diplomatic and centrist approach made most local and international observers dismiss the City of Łódź as a noble state, however one that was destined to fail. Now that Hołownia united the whole voivodeship, however, the republic's neighbors have started preparing their best orators to engage the state of Łódź on the diplomatic battlefield."
unification.1.a:0 "Is Dialogue a form of radical centrism?"

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_SZYMON_HOLOWNIA_DESC:0 "Szymon Hołownia (born 3 September 1976) is a Polish journalist, politician, television personality, writer, political commentator and humanitarian activist. From 2008 to 2019 he co-hosted Mam talent!, the Polish version of Got Talent, together with Marcin Prokop. He was an independent presidential candidate in 2020 elections, coming in third place in the first round of the elections. Terrified of the complete degradation of Poland, he escaped to Łódź, which was relatively far away from most of the chaos in the country. Known for his diplomatic approach, he was invited by the warring factions of Łódź as a mediator in the talks and the main overseer of the joint Łodzian investigation searching for answers on who and what caused the nuclear explosion in Bałuty."
