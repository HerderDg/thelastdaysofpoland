unification.166.t: "[GetNewspaper]NORDBAT unifies Western Pomerania!"
unification.166.desc: "The UN came to Poland as peacekeepers, but in West Pomerania, they have become something else entirely. NORDBAT - the infamous Nordic Battalion - has crushed the region's warlords, enforcing a fragile stability with discipline as cold as the lands they hail from. These hardened veterans, Scandinavia's finest troops, impose their own tough brand of law and order. Checkpoints dot the highways, patrols move with military precision, and those who resist quickly learn these "peacekeepers" are warriors first, diplomats second. Civilians murmur about abuses, homes raided without cause, and forced disarmament in what NORDBAT refers to as harsh but necessary counterinsurgency measures. Though, undeniably, life has improved. Markets reopen, banditry fades, and supply chains reconnect. But in a country that has fought invaders for centuries, even saviors wear the face of conquerors. The UN’s mission is clear, but what of the Poles? Will they ever see the foreign soldiers as more than just the latest force to rule them over?"
unification.166.a: "SWEDES! *spit*"

super.166.t: "[GetNewspaper]United Nations pacify Poland!"
super.166.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.166.a: "United at last."
