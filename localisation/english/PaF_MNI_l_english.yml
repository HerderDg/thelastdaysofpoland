 POLITICS_RICHARD_GALLA_DESC:0 "As a man of two nations, Ryszard Galla could only hope he’d never have to choose between them. Reality isn’t always so kind, however. \n\nThe life of Galla is one defined by his efforts to ensure peaceful co-existence between two hostile nations. Himself of German descent, he has served as the minority’s sole representative in the Polish parliament ever since the turn of the century. The job of softening their image to the staunchly nationalistic Poles, still unforgiving of the crimes inflicted upon them nearly a hundred years ago, was a thankless one. Yet, undeterred, the politician persisted, making the position his own, growing throughout his lengthy tenure into one of the most recognizable faces of the ever-changing parliament. With each election season, hundreds would come and go, yet he managed to become a constant in the nation’s politics. Although, with his voice having little influence alone, he was often forced to bend to one of the major parties’ will. With PO increasingly kowtowing to von der Leyen and the ruling party’s hostile rhetoric towards Germany making life unsafe for his constituents, it became painfully clear that Galla’s mission was becoming untenable. \n\nAnd so, when German forces crossed the border in Zgorzelec to topple the Polish government, the representative faced a difficult choice. He mused constantly about his position and whether to condone or condemn the invasion. \n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the ringing of his telephone. A personal ultimatum, directly from Donald Tusk. Either he’d join the German forces, rewarded for his loyalty with all of Opolskie, free to implement all his ideals, or refuse and meet the same fate as PiS. Intimidated by the offer, Galla would find himself accepting the deal, forever binding his fate to Tusk.  \n\nWith the invasion stalling, it became abundantly clear that governance was far more than the politician bargained for. Stuck ruling over an overwhelming, hostile Polish majority, no day passes in Opole without a riot or a protest. If the situation within the Eurokommissariats were to ever deteriorate, little hope remains for Galla to retain control of his state. So far, he hangs onto power purely by the grace of his superiors, his dream of peace between Poles and Germans shattered. \n\n§RDid you make the right choice, Herr Bundeskanzler?§!"

unification.63.desc:0 "After the collapse of the Eurokommissariats - and thus the collapse of Oberschlesische Republik - no one thought that the German minority would be able to consolidate its fallen German state on Polish soil and restore its power over individual communes of the Opolskie Voivodeship. After the destruction of the last places of resistance of the Mandate of Opole and the imprisonment of Lechite warlords in prisons, Richard Galla appealed to Poles living in these areas for "Unification of Polish and German thought" and for "Restoration of normality in the Opole region."\n\nHow will the renewed Oberschlessische Republik fit into the structures of the European Union and what will their relationship with Germany look like, who, after all, left them in the hour of trial? And above all, how long will a minority be able to rule the majority?"
