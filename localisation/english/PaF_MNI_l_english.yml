unification.63.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]German Minority unifies Opolskie!"
unification.63.desc:0 "After the collapse of the Eurocommissariats - and thus the collapse of Oberschlesische Republik - no one thought that the German minority would be able to consolidate its fallen German state on Polish soil and restore its power over individual communes of the Opolskie Voivodeship. After the destruction of the last places of resistance of the Mandate of Opole and the imprisonment of Lechite warlords in prisons, Richard Galla appealed to Poles living in these areas for "Unification of Polish and German thought" and for "Restoration of normality in the Opole region."\n\nHow will the renewed Oberschlessische Republik fit into the structures of the European Union and what will their relationship with Germany look like, who, after all, left them in the hour of trial? And above all, how long will a minority be able to rule the majority?"
unification.63.a:0 "Congratulations, we shall see how long they will last."
