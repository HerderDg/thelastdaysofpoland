unification.164.t: "[GetNewspaper]Mafia unifies Capital District!"
unification.164.desc: "Warsaw was always a battlefield - once for politicians, then for warring factions, now for gangsters. But the fight is supposedly over. The Wołomin Mafia has done what no politician could: they've united the Capital District under one flag, even if it's bloodstained.\nOld gangs? Either buried or brought into the fold. Police? A memory. Any government? That's gone as far as 2025. In their place, a different kind of order. Extortion is now 'taxation', rackets are 'businesses', and disappearances of some people are 'justice' They call it stability. People call it survival.\nSome locals don't mind - better a mafia boss than a warlord or even worse - a politician. The markets are open, the streets are patrolled, and the city runs on bribes instead of bullets. But for how long? Criminal empires don't fall at the ballot box, and in this new Warsaw, power is only as strong as the men willing to kill for it."
unification.164.a: "A warlord you can't refuse."

super.164.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.164.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.164.a: "United at last."
