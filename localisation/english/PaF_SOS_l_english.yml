POLITICS_WLODZIMIERZ_CZARZASTY_DESC:0 "These were not good years for the left-wing parties. The growth of Law and Justice's power has significantly limited the possibilities of an effective democratic campaign, mainly due to a series of persecutions against left-wing politicians and their electorate. The relentless obstruction of life by law enforcement became one of the many reasons why the Left finally snapped. Radicalized groups of socialist militias began to form throughout the country, ranging from the vandalization of monuments to attempt the bomb attack on Nowogrodzka Street. During the days before The Fall, Włodzimierz Czarzasty managed to escape the capital but found himself in an uncomfortable position as persona non grata. The EU intervention and the total disintegration of the Polish government did not surprise Czarzasty, but the nightmare that followed was not comparable to the most pessimistic scenarios. Czarzasty quickly organized a substitute administration in Sosnowiec and proclaimed the Republic of Zagłębie. The provisional apparatus of power stretched across the entire Dąbrowa Basin, from Czeladź to Dąbrowa Górnicza and Jaworzno. The left-wing Polish Committee of National Liberation, which was established, had several problems. In his search for allies who would support Czarzasty's dreams of maintaining power, he turned to the two largest factions in Zagłębie: communists from Dąbrowa Górnicza and anti-fascists from Jaworzno, creating a alliance of Międzypowiatówka. It is not hard to guess that the cracks in the common front of the left began to appear almost immediately, which resulted in these two factions being granted great autonomy. Now it is only up to Włodzimierz Czarzasty whether Międzypowiatówka will survive as one or another civil war will break out, drowning the region in blood once again."
