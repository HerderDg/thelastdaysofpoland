 INT_first_intercounty_desc: "During the Fall, the advancing forces of Ziobro from one side and the rising Silesian League from the other placed Zagłębie once again between the hammer and the anvil. The pleas of Zagłębie's politicians during the Katowice Congress—that we must stand united against outside threats—fell on deaf ears. The metropolitan authority failed us, severing everything east of the Brynica from its care. These events laid the foundation for the emergence of an entirely new movement - The Intercounty"

POLITICS_WLODZIMIERZ_CZARZASTY_DESC: "These were not good years for the left-wing parties. The growth of Law and Justice's power has significantly limited the possibilities of an effective democratic campaign, mainly due to a series of persecutions against left-wing politicians and their electorate. The relentless obstruction of life by law enforcement became one of the many reasons why the Left finally snapped. Radicalized groups of socialist militias began to form throughout the country, ranging from the vandalization of monuments to attempt the bomb attack on Nowogrodzka Street. During the days before The Fall, Włodzimierz Czarzasty managed to escape the capital but found himself in an uncomfortable position as persona non grata. The EU intervention and the total disintegration of the Polish government did not surprise Czarzasty, but the nightmare that followed was not comparable to the most pessimistic scenarios. Czarzasty quickly organized a substitute administration in Sosnowiec and proclaimed the Republic of Zagłębie. The provisional apparatus of power stretched across the entire Dąbrowa Basin, from Czeladź to Dąbrowa Górnicza and Jaworzno. The left-wing Polish Committee of National Liberation, which was established, had several problems. In his search for allies who would support Czarzasty's dreams of maintaining power, he turned to the two largest factions in Zagłębie: communists from Dąbrowa Górnicza and anti-fascists from Jaworzno, creating a alliance of Międzypowiatówka. It is not hard to guess that the cracks in the common front of the left began to appear almost immediately, which resulted in these two factions being granted great autonomy. Now it is only up to Włodzimierz Czarzasty whether Międzypowiatówka will survive as one or another civil war will break out, drowning the region in blood once again."

unification.15.t: "[GetNewspaper]Sosnowiec unifies Zagłębie and Jura!"
unification.15.desc: "After his past failures, Włodzimierz Czarzasty did not ever expect to hold any position of importance. In part, he was right, as the state he did manage to construct was merely a shadow, a distant echo of a former dream. However, the place he chose to spread his ideas from was more than welcoming. Red Zagłębie's left-wing traditions are longstanding, making it simple for Czarzasty to garner the people's support. Though the Intercounty alliance of the region's quasi-socialist states collapsed, the Chairman's militias nonetheless remained victorious.\n\nNow, the leader of the new republic faces an important task - to strategically navigate the landscape of neighboring warlords as each of them will wait for the other to stumble. With every faction hoping to unite all of Poland, a new Cold War begins. Yet, for Czarzasty, there is more than just hope to fight for."

super.15.desc: "Fall of socialist state in 1989 was only a temporary solution for four decades. But failure of capitalism and threat of an authoritarian state showed many, that the flame of revolution can never be truly extinguished.\n\nLocating his government in one of the most prominent seats of socialism in Poland, Włodzimierz Czarzasty wasn't at first sure about the way he was supposed to take to bring Poland back to life. If only he could resurrect what was best in marxist-leninist theories, and not fail like the communist states before him...\n\nBut they weren't true communists. Not really. It's Lenin after all, who was right. Together with our loyal red banners we shall liberate every man, woman and non-binary gender on this planet from their own demise."

But failure of capitalism and threat of an authoritarian state showed many, that the flame of revolution can never be truly extinguished.\n\nDeclared a Prime Minister of Republic of Zagłębie, Włodzimierz Czarzasty was still true to ideals of a socialism, and so he continued to bring back many forgotten relicts of the bygone era, as well as mixing it with modern society.\n\nAs for now, the red flags are flying all over Polish territory, and while Polish national spirit wasn't thrown away, instead it was embraced as the foundation of a better society. Czarzasty now promises a bright future and restoration of a true European Union, instead of this neoliberal German behemoth that it became."
