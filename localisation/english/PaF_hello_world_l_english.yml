## Regional Info
 MAIN_LORE:0 "\n\n The year is 2027. The world has gone crazy. Where the Polish state once flourished, anarchy and lawlessness reign. In the center and in the east of the country, power is held undividedly by a herd of various warlords fighting among themselves for the meager remains of their former riches. In the west, on the other hand, there are the Eurocommissariats, supported by the European Union's intervention forces that struggle to survive because of the economic crisis and peoples' unrest. But how did this happen?\n\nNobody knows how in the world PiS won the elections in 2023. The scandals about the use of the Pegasus system to spy on the opposition, and observers' doubts about the honesty of the electoral commissions shed some light on this. The fact is that Law and Justice has achieved their desired monopoly. In the following years, TVN was closed, abortion was banned, and costly investments in the CPK, the Vistula Spit cut, and the reconstruction of the Saxon Palace were maintained. There was a growing anxiety in the country, which was expressed in requests for an intervention by the European Union, in which significant changes took place at that time.\n\nThe elections in Germany in 2021 ended with a victory for the CDU, which was radicalized as a result of the growing economic crisis and the pandemic. The solution to these problems was supposed to lie in radical European integration. With time, the German government merged into one with the structures of the EU, becoming the European government. Some of the countries where Eurosceptic movements began to come to power, such as Hungary, Bulgaria or Slovakia, left the EU, while others, under the pressure of the European army, a successor to the Bundeswehr, were forced to stay.\n\nThe situation in Russia made the European Union's attempts to sway governments all the more appealing. There, as a result of the revolution, Alexei Navalny came to power and Vladimir Putin escaped under the cover of Rosguard to Kaliningrad. The reason being election fraud. It soon turned out that the new master of the Kremlin began to use more and more nationalist rhetoric in order to stay in power. This was followed by a full-scale invasion of Belarus ending with a complete annexation of the smaller country. A shadow of terror fell on Europe, hanging on a thin thread like a sword of Damocles.\n\nHowever, nothing could stop the outbreak of social anger in Poland when the presidential election was canceled under the pretext of pandemic restrictions. The European Union responded to the opposition's appeals and entered the country plunged into chaos. The defenses collapsed after few hours. The Russians made a pre-emptive attack on Masuria. European forces stopped on the Warta line. They feared escalating the conflict between the EU and Russia, and unrest in Western Europe was becoming more and more apparent. For this reason, the creation of the Eurocommisariats was a necessary measure. The Polish government, meanwhile, tore itself apart after when a nuclear explosion of an unknown origin evaporated whole Bałuty district of the city of Łódź. Local warlords began to take power over the unoccupied territories and anarchy prevailed.\n\nThe whole of Europe is trembling in its boots and nobody knows what the next day will bring...§!"

The §1Optimates§! must stand their ground, especially during times of crisis. \n\nYou need to pass the §1Optimates§! version of the law in the focus §YLex Barbarorum§!.\n\n§03. Praetorian Plot:§!\n\nFor the §0Praetorian Plot§! to fire, the §0Praetorian Guard§! must at some point become disloyal to the §YEmperor§! (below 30 loyalty). The plot will fire during a time of Crisis, during the §pPopulares§! path, when their gerrymandering in the Senate becomes apparent. After the plan is formed, §0Praetorian§! gravitas needs to be kept above that of the §YEmperor's§! in order to prevent it from being found out.\n\nTheir path allows them to secure power all for themselves, or follow in the steps of Cincinnatus, relinquishing power back in the hands of the Senate, with a good dose of oversight.\n\n§03a.

If the §0Praetorians§! are ever made disloyal to the §YEmperor§! and their gravitas higher than the §1Optimates'§! when the §1Optimates§! move to secure their rule over Calisia during Crisis, the §YEmperor§! will meet a mysterious death.\n\n§R5.
