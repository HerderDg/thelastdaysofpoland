Rotten to the core. There's no saving it -- we need to pull it out by the roots. WIpe the slate clean. BURN IT DOWN! And from the ashes, a new Poland will be born. Evolved, but untamed! The weak will be purged, and the strongest will thrive -- free to live as they see fit, they will make Poland GREAT AGAIN!\n\nWhat the hell are you talking about?\n\nYou still don't get it.

 REGIONAL_INFO_EUROPE: "§G==EUROPE==§!\n\nIt was not under the glorious banners of heroic men that Europe descended towards oblivion, nor was it the forward progress of the world that left all of Western Civilization scarred and deformed in the wake of the 1940's. Rather, it was the fear and terror inspired by the §gGerman Reich§! in its scornful conquests across the fields of France, Russia, and beyond. Everywhere one may look, the §gGerman Reich§! has brought about its influence, whether through its overlordship of a dozen European puppets leading a cleansing effort against the native populaces, or the gutted nature of the §OMediterranean§! following the failures of the Atlantropa project, all has been touched by the iron heart of Führer Adolf Hitler, self-described as the "Master of Europe."\n\nHowever, such a master does not bear the likeness of its subjects, nor the respect of its neighbors. Instead, the South of Germany finds itself tied into a massive Anti-German alliance known as the §OTriumvirate§!, intent on rebuilding the ruined European economy through the political gauntlet of §yItaly's§! upper chambers in the rapidly changing political climate of the insatiable Empire, the insufferable bureaucracy of Franco and Salazar's dual-dictatorship which breeds discontent among the populace of the §wIberian Union§!, and the distant, angered, wronged cries of the §rTurkish§! over foreign conquests denied from it for so long.\n\nHowever, such is not the only notable threats to the Führer's borders as well, as whispers of the storm of dissent hovering over the previously stormed lands of the §wUnited Kingdom§! has left the collaborationist government in fear of an incoming battle for their homeland, while the §jEast§! finds the many cultures of Slavs, Poles, and other large minorities waging a war of the underground against the many Reichskommissars and other collaborationist regimes operating in the Balkans claiming dictatorial, imperial dominion over their homeland.\n\n§gThe German Eagle§! has soared high over Europe, and greatly has this flight left it's wings burned; however, the fight is not over yet. Whilst the Reich brews in its own hotbed of sycophancy, betrayal, and competition for succession in lieu of the Führer's impending demise, a §PState of Shadow§! lies due west, biding its time, watching each and every move of the many states across Europe, plotting its own machinations in the wake of disenchantment from the Reich's failures. And the §POrdensstaat§! only has so much time left to accomplish its mark upon this corrupted world..."
 
 REGIONAL_INFO_ENGLAND: "§G==BRITISH ISLES==§!\n\nAn empire long united must divide. And an empire long divided must unite. The United Kingdom of §PGreat Britain and Northern Ireland§! is no more, the horrors of World War 2 and the §gGerman§! Invasion sundering the nation apart.\n\nChief of the nations in former §PGreat Britain§! still is §xEngland§!. Though once at the head of an empire which spanned the globe, in the modern era §xEngland§! has fallen on hard times. The collaborationist government of the §gRoyal Party§!, a loose alliance of those unwilling to risk the ire of Germania, governs the country in a decidedly undemocratic manner. Nonetheless, under the leadership of §gAlec Douglas-Home§!, the collaborationists have managed to piece together a functional administration for the first time in years. Yet not all the men of §xEngland§! submit to the §gGerman§! yoke. Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance, the §eHMMLR§!, are the foremost group in the struggle against fascism. A mix of communists, monarchists and everything in between §eHMMLR§! is united almost solely by their mutual antipathy for the collaborationists and all who serve them. But the balance between these two groups is precarious, and who knows what could happen should the international stage move erratically?\n\nIn the north the §MRepublic of Scotland§! holds out as the last truly democratic nation in the isles. Formed not by treaty but by the rogue Field Marshal Wimberley and John McCormick's §YScottish National Party§! as a last bid to ward off advancing §gGerman§! forces, §MScotland§! is an eclectic mix of exiles, natives and soldiers that share only their hatred of the Reich and all who serve her in common. Yet despite existing for nigh on two decades the Republic is fundamentally unstable, riven by divides between nationalists, unionists and other parties still. The future of Scotland is dependent on that of §xEngland§!, and whether an independent Scotland is the future or a blip on the historical radar is yet to be seen.\n\nTo the west of §xEngland§! lies the nation of §GWales§!. Forcedly separated from §xEngland§! during the course of the treaty of surrender, the Welsh have attempted to rebuild their nation which hasn't existed in over seven centuries, to varying results. Internally the Welsh are even more split by the matter of unionism than their Scottish brethren, with parties all across the political spectrum holding a variety of opinions on the matter, the only consistent agreement being that a union at present would be disastrous. A potential issue in the future of Wales though might be with their primary export. The coal mines of the Welsh primarily export to §gGermany§! after all, and were something to interrupt this it might prove disastrous for the fledgling celtic nation.\n\nAcross the Irish Sea, the §yRepublic of Ireland§! eeks out a meagre existence as the second of the §gUnity§! §gPakt's§! allies in the British Isles. Aiding the Germans in their conquest of §oNorthern Ireland§! during the course of the Second World War, the Irish have few friends to be found outside the §gPakt's§! influence. With the situation growing ever more unstable in Europe however, the future of the emerald isle is an uncertain one, and is likely to be impacted heavily by whomever emerges victorious in Britain. But the Irish people are not known for giving in to inevitable results, one way or another the English will find that out firsthand when the time comes.\n\nBritain is a land of chaos, a land of unrest, a land of opportunity. Whom shall rise and whom shall fall is left up to those who take power for themselves. Let the winner take all!"
 
 REGIONAL_INFO_EAST_ASIA: "§G==EASTERN ASIA==§!\n\n§MEast Asia§!, a region now free of §RWestern Imperialism§! has a new master - §eThe Empire of Japan§!. With it's crushing victories in the Greater East Asia War, the Imperial State commands the loyalty of the liberated nations previously under the colonialist yoke, and the attention of the world. Her warring fury had swept across the east in a marvelous strike of military prowess and imperial strength. However, Tokyo's grip over its new client states is waning, and §edrums of war§! beat again.\n\nTo her north and west stand the §PEmpire of Manchuria§!, a loyal ally and puppet of the Japanese, and the §wRepublic of China§!, an increasingly rowdy satellite state angered by Tokyo's dominance over the east. To the south, the nations of §RIndonesia, Syonan§!, and various others pay homage to their Japanese allies, but the fires of revolt and rebellion burn louder and faster with each year that passes. Nonetheless, on the surface, Japanese hold of the Pacific is firm and secure, only threatened by the vexed postulations the Americans in the east and Germans to the west.\n\n§OThe Co-Prosperity Sphere§!, a geopolitical organization set up to hold together Japanese prizes from conquests, stands tall over Asia to unite the liberated nations under the leadership of the Imperial State. IJA garrisons stand to defend Japan's allies, marching from the banks of the Amur river to the jungles of Bengal, and IJN fleets patrol the eastern waters to guard from foreign incursion.\n\nIt is 1962, and Tokyo rules over The East. The New Order has resettled differences between nations and peoples, with entire civilizations now faced to bear witness to the might of the Rising Sun. However, old habits die hard, and generations will not forget their bitter rivalries with neighboring enemies and resent for their colonial oppressors."

 REGIONAL_INFO_WEST_SIBERIA: "§G==WEST SIBERIA==§!\n\nWith the death of the §GSoviet Union§! came the birth of the §WWest Siberian People's Republic§!, a Bolshevik state headed by the authoritarian §GLazar Kaganovich§!. Assigned to the isolated region under Bukharin, Lazar wove webs and forged alliances that put him at the helm of an iron nation. But with time came vengeance, so when §GWest Russia§! launched its infamous war against the §Rfascist aggressor§!, the Republic stood by. But with war came defeat, bitter loss that took its final toll upon the Russian people. City after city, civilization collapsed into anarchy, out of which arose idealist states and the stuff of nightmares.\n\nThe West Siberian People's Republic was thrown into chaos as well, suffering from a lack of initiative and back-stabbings against Kaganovich's regime. The collapse came with no surprise, fracturing into petty warlords:\n\nIn the center sits the steel city of §GTyumen§!, below which gather armies in preparation for the next war. Smoke bellows from massive factories to the sound of marching feet, soldiers heading in one direction, resettled peasants in the other. §GKaganovich§! and §GKhrushchev§! cling against hope that they may repudiate their past mistakes. But to the North lies a greater adversary - §WSverdlovsk§!, commanded by the aging §GGeneral Konstantin Rokossovsky§!. A father to his men, the military junta wields a powerful army but remains relatively apolitical. In its crosshairs is Tyumen, and next, all of Russia. In the South, hugging the wastes of Kazakhstan, sleeps a monster of great malice. The spartan city of §ROmsk§! extends its bony grip across Western Siberia, rallying men whose mere names conjure fear. Like a chessmaster, the §RBlack League§! calculates its every move, but whispers speak of death and a succession crisis.\n\nHigh atop the mountains sits the §Ymerchant republic of Zlatoust§!. Content with one of the largest military complexes in Russia, the merchants of death help arm the armies which may one day lead to their own demise. But the Republic is also home to innovators, its stability and justice attracts many refugees. New rifles pour from modern assembly lines - anyone who wishes to obtain the treasures of the Mountain will have to come and take it. But Zlatoust is not alone - in the North is the §WThief Territory of Yugra§!. A country without laws, ran by bandits and thugs, Yugra launches constant raids for food and ammunition.\n\nCornered against the icy sea is §WVorkuta§!, remnants of the Vorkutan Corrective Labor camp. One of the largest §RGULAGs§! in Russia, its prisoners freeze before the guards, themselves confined to ancient structures, feeding on scraps. The last 'warlord' are the §WFree Aviators§!, remnants of the Soviet air corps. Unique in its leadership, the Aviators do not have a functioning government - rather, they are a collection of airfields, the last line of defense against the Lufwaffe's endless onslaught. The Aviators command respect from all factions, but their numbers dwindle every day, until there will be none left. Rumours of Hitler's imminent death and the Pakt's collapse may halt the terror bombings, paving the way for a war of national reclamation.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*Mobilize the industry and rally your armies to rebuild Western Siberia, either under the Crimson flag or the Black League.\n\n*Utilize superior industry to conquer Western Russia when the time is right, but do not forget about the Southern Urals.\n\n*Gear for the inevitable war against Germany."

 REGIONAL_INFO_CENTRAL_SIBERIA: "§G==CENTRAL SIBERIA==§!\n\nCentral Siberia once stood defiantly as the §WCentral Siberian Republic§!, the world's eyes on its capital §WTomsk§! as the young nation strove confidently into the future. Holding most of Russia's remaining industry as a result of Bukharin's Central Siberian Industrial Plan, the Republic was seen as the likeliest candidate for Russian Unification.\n\nIn the end however, it was not German Fascism but the inability of Russians to work together that brought down the nation. Internal strife and a foreign invasion broke the back of the Central Siberian Republic, leaving a myriad of successor states in its wake.\n\nTo the South West, the §WFederation of Novosibirsk and Barnaul§! plots to make good use of its agricultural land and heavy industry to reunite the region. Legendary ace pilot §WPokryshkin§! and his junta had a first row seat to the collapse of the old Republic. They plan not to repeat its mistakes. East of the federation one can find §Wthe Principalty of Kemerovo§!. Led by §WKing Rurik II§!, the small statelets blend of medieval Russia and modernity leaves many confused. Some write off §WRurik II§! as a mad old fool. Others note that his well ran state and well trained army is likely to play an important part in future events.\n\nEast of §WKemerovo§!, another breakaway state led by a former §WCSR§! general can be found in §WKrasnoyarsk§!. The shaky democracy's future is uncertain; what is clearer is that §WNikolai Andreev§! and his fellow mutineers will fight tooth and nail to maintain their independence. Meanwhile, to the §WPrincipalty's§! south one can find the mountainous §WKarakorum Government of Oyrotia§!. Cut off from the §WCSR's§! central government, the small nation of Altai people and Old Believer refugees have united in their effort to avoid bloodshed and oppression for their religious beliefs.\n\nEast of §WKrasnoyarsk§! lies an expanse of villages and free cities. Imagining the area undefended would however be a dangerous mistake, for the §WSiberian Black Army§! zealously defends the region. Adherents of a particularly militarized variant of anarchism, the leadership of the §WBlack Army§! plots its next moves. All of Russia must be freed from statist oppression, beginning with Central Siberia.\n\nFinally to the north, the rump of the §WCentral Siberian Republic§! controls the city of Tomsk and the vast arctic expanses beyond. Many have written off the city of artists and thinkers as soft, decadent and unable to contend with the loss of a majority of its army to secessions and rebellions. Nevertheless, §WPresident Pasternak§! has not given up. Nearing the end of his life, the Poet President plans to entrust the rump §WCSR§! to a new political elite, one able to restore the §WCentral Siberian Republic§! to greatness.\n\nExhausted by war with the §RRussian Far East§! and civil conflicts for a few years, the rivalries of Central Siberia have begun to rouse the various warlords from their fragile peace. There is only enough room in Central Siberia for one nation, one heir to Bukharin's Industrial Cornucopia. The Soviet era's foundries and factories will cause yet more bloodshed as the unification wars begin!\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*§WUnite§! the rich Central Siberian region and use it as a springboard to Russian Reunification.\n\n*§WManage§! your share of the Central Siberian industries, expanding it and dealing with worker's rights issues as the regional conflict heats up."

 REGIONAL_INFO_FAR_EAST: "§G==THE FAR EAST==§!\n\nThe §WRussian Far East§! is far and away the least populated region in Russia, and contains some of the most treacherous and hostile landscapes in the continent. The cataclysmic collapse of the §GSoviet Union§! did little to change this state of affairs, and even a far flung region such as this is now home to all manner of warlords seeking to stake their claim to Russia.\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse, §GGenrikh Yagoda§! fled east with the remnants of the Soviet Presidium and reestablished order over the province of §GIrkutsk§!. From there, he has solidified an iron reign over the region that has frequently come into conflict with neighboring rival warlords such as the §RCentral Siberian Republic§!. It was not to last, however, as disaster soon struck.\n\nFrom the Manchurian city of §GHarbin§!, dark forces crossed the Amur and marched north to wage a bloody war of vengeance against §RBolshevism§!. §GKonstantin Rodzaevsky§! and his §GRussian Fascist Party§! were the tip of this invasion's spear, shattering Yagoda's influence in the East and establishing his own regime in the city of Zeya. It wasn't long, however, before Rodzaevsky himself was threatened with collapse.\n\nA "moderate" faction of the RFP led by §GMikhail Matkovsky§! grew disgusted with Rodzaevsky's admiration of the §RNazi invaders§!, and over time came to resent his dogmatic rhetoric. These tensions came to a head, and resulted in Matkovsky's loyalists snatching the key port of §GMagadan§! from Rodzaevsky's grasp. Sensing their chance, §GWhite Army§! remnants based in Harbin secured control over their old stronghold in §GChita§!. With a claimant of their own, one §GMikhail II§!, they plan to restore the monarchy to Russia by whatever means necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, The final threat to §GYagoda's§! power came in the form of a mutiny. Former NKVD officer §GValery Sablin§!, a young and idealistic revolutionary, seized control over the province of §GBuryatia§! and declared an open revolt against Yagoda and the Presidium. As of 1962, this war is still raging, and it is unclear who will come out on top.\n\nTo the north, the region has devolved into total anarchy. Very few have made their homes in this arctic hell, and there is not likely to be much in the way of action here. However, there are scattered rumors amongst the tribes and villages of the north of a §Gpowerful figure§! with the strength to reunify the nation...\n\nThe §WRussian Far East§! is a desolate and bloodsoaked land, and it is not likely to get any better until this wasteland is united once and for all.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*Defend the last remnant of the Soviet Union, or bring about its destruction.\n\n*Make the most with what you have in a desolate landscape.\n\n*Be wary of §Gthe North§!."

 REGIONAL_INFO_URAL: "§G==SOUTHERN URALS==§!\n\n§WThe Southern Urals§! represent the Russian Anarchy at its best and worst. To the west, §WThe Communes of Orenburg§! constitute thousands of citizens in its anarchic council, while the shrewd management of §WOrenburg§! itself has led to it gleaming brightly as the Gem of the Urals. While dysfunctional, §WOrenburg§! nevertheless represents the achievements of the Russian people even in this dark stage of their history. To the north sits the §WUral League§!, the paramilitary children of Vorkuta, who, after the union of both guards and prisoners in the 50s, have dedicated themselves to protecting the week and needy of Russia.\n\nTo their south, however, lies the §WDirlewanger Brigade§!. They are dastardly bandits, the result of in-fighting in the §RGerman§! ranks during the §WWest Russian War§!, Dirlewanger and his crew of only the most depraved criminals from the SS and Eastern Europe having carved themselves out a petty fiefdom in what was once §WOrsk§!. Their goal? §WOrenburg§!, and the great loot contained within. But he is not alone in this desire, for §WTrofim Lysenko§!, petty warlord of §WMagnitogorsk§!, also looks hungrily westward. The maddened remainder of the Soviet science program with his own pet army in the §W22nd Motor Rifle NKVD§!, §WLysenko§! plots his eventual invasion of §WOrenburg§! for the perfect opportunity to collect thousands of test subjects to create a secret weapon... a super soldier army capable of defeating the §RGermans§!.\n\nWhile §WOrenburg§! and §WThe Ural League§! will make natural allies in their defense against the bandits, §WLysenko§! is a pragmatist, and so is §WDirlewanger§!. It is likely that pacts will form, but the question is ultimately what to do once they outlast their use... and what to do if forces outside of the Urals some day come knocking to their door.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* A §Wshort§!, five year game, aimed at defeating the opposing two (or three) factions in the Urals.\n\n* §WUnify§! the communes of Orenburg or handle Lysenko's waning §Wsanity§!, §Wravage§! Russia as the King of Bandits or §Wprotect§! it as its staunchest defenders."

 REGIONAL_INFO_AFRICA: "§G==SOUTHERN AFRICA==\n\n§!From the Sahara's fringes to the Cape of Good Hope, Central and Southern Africa simmers with the aftershocks of conflicts both old and new. The §WReich's§! resurgence has not left the §YDark Continent§! untouched; its talons have gouged a sea out of its heartland, and its sons hold sway over a dominion past two thousand miles from end to end. But the glorious years have passed §WGermania§!. Now its grip loosens with every day bickering paralyzes the Volkshalle.\n\nNot all has fallen to the fascist menace, however. At the continent's tip burns defiant the §WUnion of South Africa§!, among the old empire's last dominions across the seas - certainly the last of what had once stretched from Cape Town to Cairo. Its fortunes have waned since the war's end; with Namibia torn from its grasp and its own people split in three loyalties, Africa's last democracy flickers and wanes amidst incessant threats of secession, rebellion, and invasion. Nevertheless, the Union's men hold firm along the Orange River's banks, steeling themselves with the certitude of a death in defense of their homes.\n\nFor to their north stands a triumvirate of Africa's most powerful men: §YReichskommissars Wolfgang Schenck§!, §YSiegfried Müller§! and §YHans Hüttig§!, viceroys of a third each of the Reich's Mittelafrikan conquests. Though cartographers depict their lands as one contiguous stretch of pitch black the same shade as the Heimat's, each §WReichskommissariat§! cannot be any more different from the rest. Companies and mercenaries the world over loot §WZentralafrika's§! vast wealth unheeded as §YMüller§! eagerly plans his next hunting expedition. §YSchenck§! and his Luftwaffe dance among the clouds far above §WSüdwestafrika§!, heedless of the troubles plaguing his subjects below.\n\nOnly §YHüttig§!, master of the Dark Continent's true Aryan bastion and overseer of a million slaves, casts a frigid eye beyond §WOstafrika's§! borders. Few but his closest advisors can divine the plans lurking in the zealot's mind; with his tendencies, fewer bet they will bring the continent anything but misery and grief.\n\nIt is 1962, and the §WNew Order§! frays at its edges. Old enmities resurge as a thousand plans spring into action. Circumstance binds three desperate eagles into one hesitant, tenuous alliance. Far in the distance, like a thunderous tempest, war comes to spill blood onto the savannah's sands once more. Strap up your NF-LAG, pack your OD greens, and don't forget the old refrain as you wage the §RSouth African War§!: §Wbravo don't surf.§!\n\n§G==FEATURES==\n\n§!* Fight a §Rconflict§! involving nations around the world, which may decide the Cold War's fate.\n\n* Set the stage for §YAfrica's§! future, with many possible outcomes in the continent.\n\n* New content - events, mechanics, nations - added since the previous demo."

 REGIONAL_INFO_AMERICA:0 "§G==THE AMERICAS==§!\n\n§PGuyana§!:\nThe situation in the §PRepublic of Guyana§! is tense, and grows worse with every passing day. The rights of §YIndo-Guyanans§! are continually being restricted or taken away by the iron-fisted president, §RForbes Burnham.§! Burnham himself is becoming increasingly combative and dismissive of the §BUnited States§!, who put him into power in the first place. As Guyana draws closer and closer to dictatorship, conflict seems §xinevitable.§!\n\n§RCanada§!:\n§RThe Dominion of Canada§! is, on paper, under the §wBritish Crown.§! In reality, she is far more shackled to her southern neighbor, the §BUnited States of America.§! As British exiles fled the isles, however, they brought much of their §wculture and more conservative ideals.§! This discrepancy with the local Canadians has led to a significant amount of friction between the native §GEnglish-speaking Canadians§!, the §QQuebecois§!, and the §wBritish exiles§!. As §RQuebecois terrorist§! groups like the §RFLQ§! and §RFUNQ§! grow larger by the day, Canada's problems are striking home in more ways than one.\n\n§BIceland§!:\nIceland is independent only in name, and is effectively a military protectorate of the §BUnited States§!. Nearly as many American soldiers live on the frigid island nation as there are §Gnative Icelanders§!. These Americans enforce law and protect the country from §xGerman influence§!, but also use Icelandic taxes, marry Icelandic women, and §wexploit Icelandic resources§!. In short, people are tired of American occupation and exploitation. It is a tense situation, at best, and §Rgrowing tenser by the day§!.\n\n§GMexico§!:\nHaving once prospered by staying away from other nations' wars, the §GRepublic of Mexico§! now seems poised to wage war on itself. Not a day passes by without squabbles erupting between the country's §Mprotectionist elites§! and the §Pambassadors of companies from New York to Tokyo§!. Moreover, the §wPartido Revolucionaro Institucional§! has shaped the country's image into the regime it had overthrown - a wealthy, maladroit, and contemptibly corrupt one-party state - to the chagrin of the many whose upliftment it had promised long ago. Mexico finds itself at many crossroads as the new decade trudges onward. Which fork it shall travel - §Rand what crises it shall invite§! - remain to be seen."

 REGIONAL_INFO_SOUTH_AMERICA: "§G==SOUTH AMERICA==§!\n\nSouth America - a continent perpetually tormented by plagues: poverty, exploitation, underdevelopment, hunger, sickness, and most importantly and terribly of all, conflict.

The recent disastrous §MAmerican§!-backed §RGuairá Falls Invasion§! in §hParaguay§! is just one example of the current shift in the age-old conflict, that of §dforeign superpowers treating the continent as their personal sandbox§!, and old rivalries are still at play in defining the geopolitical order of South America, be it in the Chaco or the Andes.\n\nThe §MAmericans§! try to consolidate their sphere of influence in the region, relying on subterfuge, humanitarian aid, and political influence, while the §eJapanese§!, §rGermans§!, and even §nItalians§! attempt to break down the door any way they can. Though South America will continue to be plagued by the ills of its past no matter what changes it undergoes, the continent still has a chance of raising itself to a higher quality of existence.
