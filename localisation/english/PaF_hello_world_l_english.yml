 MAIN_LORE:0 "§YPRIDE AND FALL STORY:\n\n The year is 2027. The world has gone crazy. Where the Polish state once flourished, anarchy and lawlessness reign. In the center and in the east of the country, power is held undividedly by a herd of various warlords fighting among themselves for the meager remains of their former riches. In the west, on the other hand, there are Eurocommissariats, supported by the intervention forces of the European Union that struggle to survive because of the economic crisis and peoples unrest. But what happened to make this happen?\n\nNobody knows how it happened that PiS won the elections in 2023. The scandals about the use of the Pegasus system to spy on the opposition, and observers' doubts about the honesty of the electoral commissions shed some light on this. The fact is that Law and Justice has achieved the desired monopoly. In the following years, TVN was closed, abortion was banned, and costly investments in the CPK, the Vistula Spit cut, and the reconstruction of the Saski Palace were maintained. There was a growing anxiety in the country, which was expressed in requests for an intervention by the European Union, in which significant changes took place at that time.\n\nThe elections in Germany in 2021 ended with a victory for the CDU, which was radicalized as a result of the growing economic crisis and pandemic. The solution to these problems was supposed to lie in more precise European integration. With time, the German government merged into one with the structures of the EU, becoming the European government. Some of the countries where Eurosceptic movements began to come to power, such as Hungary, Bulgaria or Slovakia, left the EU, while others, under the pressure of the European army transformed from Bundeswehr, were forced to remain.\n\nThe situation in Russia increased the strength of the EU's Persuasion. There, as a result of the revolution, Alexei Navalny came to power, and Vladimir Putin escaped under the cover of Rosguard to Chechnya. It was about election fraud. It soon turned out that the new Kremlin master began to use more and more nationalist rhetoric in order to stay in power. This was followed by deeds - a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Belarus. The former currently has a border on the Dnieper and the latter is no longer there. A shadow of terror fell on the divisive Europe.\n\nHowever, nothing could stop the outbreak of social anger in Poland when the presidential election was canceled under the pretext of pandemic restrictions. The European Union responded to the opposition's appeals and entered the country plunged into chaos. The defense collapsed after a few hours. The Russians made a preventive attack on Masuria. European forces stopped on the Warta line. They feared the escalation of the conflict between the EU and Russia, and the unrest in Western Europe was becoming more and more apparent. For this reason, the creation of Eurokomissartiatów was satisfied. The Polish government, meanwhile, broke up after the Polish Atomic Program, the last chance for victory, ended with the Balucki Incident. Local warlords began to take power over the unoccupied territories and anarchy prevailed.\n\nThe whole of Europe is trembling in its foundations and nobody knows what the second day will bring….§!"
