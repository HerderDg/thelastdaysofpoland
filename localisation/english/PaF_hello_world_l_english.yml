## Regional Info
 MAIN_LORE: "\n\n The year is 2027. The world has gone crazy. Where the Polish state once flourished, anarchy and lawlessness reign. In the center and in the east of the country, power is held undividedly by a herd of various warlords fighting among themselves for the meager remains of their former riches. In the west, on the other hand, there are the Eurocommissariats, supported by the European Union's intervention forces that struggle to survive because of the economic crisis and peoples' unrest. But how did this happen?\n\nNobody knows how in the world PiS won the elections in 2023. The scandals about the use of the Pegasus system to spy on the opposition, and observers' doubts about the honesty of the electoral commissions shed some light on this. The fact is that Law and Justice has achieved their desired monopoly. In the following years, TVN was closed, abortion was banned, and costly investments in the CPK, the Vistula Spit cut, and the reconstruction of the Saxon Palace were maintained. There was a growing anxiety in the country, which was expressed in requests for an intervention by the European Union, in which significant changes took place at that time.\n\nThe elections in Germany in 2021 ended with a victory for the CDU, which was radicalized as a result of the growing economic crisis and the pandemic. The solution to these problems was supposed to lie in radical European integration. With time, the German government merged into one with the structures of the EU, becoming the European government. Some of the countries where Eurosceptic movements began to come to power, such as Hungary, Bulgaria or Slovakia, left the EU, while others, under the pressure of the European army, a successor to the Bundeswehr, were forced to stay.\n\nThe situation in Russia made the European Union's attempts to sway governments all the more appealing. There, as a result of the revolution, Alexei Navalny came to power and Vladimir Putin escaped under the cover of Rosguard to Kaliningrad. The reason being election fraud. It soon turned out that the new master of the Kremlin began to use more and more nationalist rhetoric in order to stay in power. This was followed by a full-scale invasion of Belarus ending with a complete annexation of the smaller country. A shadow of terror fell on Europe, hanging on a thin thread like a sword of Damocles.\n\nHowever, nothing could stop the outbreak of social anger in Poland when the presidential election was canceled under the pretext of pandemic restrictions. The European Union responded to the opposition's appeals and entered the country plunged into chaos. The defenses collapsed after few hours. The Russians made a pre-emptive attack on Masuria. European forces stopped on the Warta line. They feared escalating the conflict between the EU and Russia, and unrest in Western Europe was becoming more and more apparent. For this reason, the creation of the Eurocommisariats was a necessary measure. The Polish government, meanwhile, tore itself apart after when a nuclear explosion of an unknown origin evaporated whole Bałuty district of the city of Łódź. Local warlords began to take power over the unoccupied territories and anarchy prevailed.\n\nThe whole of Europe is trembling in its boots and nobody knows what the next day will bring...§!"

CONTEXT_CAL: "§H============================================================\nWhat is this faction?\n============================================================§!\n\nCalisia is a state that tries to restore the glory and power of Roman Empire by all means necessary. It might look like a LARP, but in time it gets really serious. It comes with every up and down of a real historical Rome down to factional infighting, praetorian coups, unruly Senate and barbarian invasions. It's a fast history lesson bottled up in a Polish warlord state.\n\n§H============================================================\nWhy are they here?\n============================================================§!\n\nCity of Kalisz is presumed to have long history, but some of the people claim that its roots come from ancient city of Calisia which is present on the Ptolemy's map somewhere in this region. Also, there were many found artifacts from the Roman times. As far as the claims for the Roman Empire goes, this one is clearly not too strong, but this doesn't stop the city from embracing this acclaimed history. Many of the street or building names are references to the ancient history and the city is proud of this.\n\n§H============================================================\nWho are the characters?\n============================================================§!\n\nRyszard Kalisz is a lawyer and left-wing politician that for many years was a part of Polish parliament. Though his prime time is long gone, he still is active in the political life. He's here just solely because of his name. Which coincidentally is the same as Polish name for this city. His only connection to Roman Empire is his knowledge of the law, and perhaps he was few times on a vacations in Italy. But, he was always a jovial man and despite his appearances - a womanizer. It's not so hard to imagine him as a hedonistic Emperor.\n\nRest of the characters are real politicians from the region and some of them are scholars that specialize in the ancient or medieval history\n\nReal president of the city of Kalisz is actually Krystian Kinastowski who plays a role of Praefectus of the Praetorian Guard here\n\nMarcus Vinicius is a character from the Polish movie Quo Vadis about the burning of the Rome by Nero, played by Paweł Deląg. And he just looks too nice to pass on this opportunity to have him as a character\n\nMarcin Najman, who becomes an Emperor in one of the endings really did pose as an \"Emperor\" in one of his stunts to promote his fighting galas. Also, he liked to comment current political affairs dressed as beforementioned \"Emperor\"\n\n§H============================================================\nWhat is this faction inspired by?\n============================================================§!\n\nRome. A lot of Rome\n\nAlso, the fact that there is Calisia on the Ptolemy's map\n\nAnd maybe a bit of Ceasar's Legion from the Fallout. But it was not really decisive one.\n\n§H============================================================\nMiscellaneous lore details\n============================================================§!\n\nThere are lot of references to movie Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra. We do love that movie here in Poland.\n\nThis faction was created solely for the purpose of writing as many events about Ryszard Kalisz going to Żabka shop (Ranula in latin) as possible. I mean, not entirely - but it became a running joke during the development\n"

CONTEXT_ATM: "§H============================================================\nWhat is this faction?\n============================================================§!\n\nAtomic Crusade is a fictional faction that began as a mistification, as a threat carefully created by Brotherhood's propaganda departement and books of Elder Ziemkiewicz. But after a while this threat turned out to have a serious amount of pull towards its ideology and Jakub Wiech had no other option than to flow with it. It's an environmental crusade against coal and emissions, and moreover - it's a pro-nuclear faction that will not stop until Poland will achieve nuclear power status.\n\n§H============================================================\nWhy are they here?\n============================================================§!\n\nWhere is the more perfect place for atomic afficionados than Bałuty Exclusion Zone? Additionally, it's a perfect spot to begin their environmental crusade against Brotherhood of Coal who has in their black pawns whole of the voivodeship.\n\n§H============================================================\nWho are the characters?\n============================================================§!\n\nJakub Wiech is one of the more known Polish journalists and renewable energy experts that is set upon the impossible task of convincing Polish population that renewable energy is not a devil in disguise and nuclear power is safe and needed for our country to prosper. Not everyone looks at him with admiration though.\n\n§H============================================================\nWhat is this faction inspired by?\n============================================================§!\n\nAtomic Crusade is strongly following the Fallout theme, we do have a slight Children of Atom vibe here, but we tried to fit in every other nuclear trope we could find such as for example Stalker or Metro franchises\n\nIn the ongoing political dispute, Jakub Wiech is a stron opponent of German climatic policies, especially their Energiewende program and shutting down their nuclear power plants, which gave birth to in-game lore of going against German state in the end game\n\n§H============================================================\nMiscellaneous lore details\n============================================================§!\n\nNuclear Power Plant Construction Focus Tree is inspired by various propositions for the real Polish state to build their first nuclear power plant. Some were discarded, some were considered. We tried to focus on the most interesting ones.\n\nAcquisition of uranium deposits in-game is far-fetched when it comes to Polish actual deposits, most of them are considered not viable for extraction or would result in massive landscape changes in settled areas. But it's just a game and it was a massive pain to calculate amounts from each deposits so the numbers would somewhat check out.\n\nJakub Wiech is one of the few real people that know about our mod and he was very supportive and happy about it. We can't complement him enough so again - we send our best regards to him.\n\nFirst focus tree was created in a fucking dream of one of the developers.\n"

CONTEXT_BBW: "§H============================================================\nWhat is this faction?\n============================================================§!\n\nBrotherhood of Coal is a fictional faction dedicated to one single goal: to make Poland burn coal, and burn it hard\n\nThey are organized in quasi military order form with slight traces of a liberal approach to economy (at the start)\n\nThey oppose any form of ecologism and anything to do with renewable energy sources\n\n§H============================================================\nWhy are they here?\n============================================================§!\n\nBełchatów Mine is one of the largest lignite coal mines in Europe, and it's so vast it's visible from space.\n\nBełchatów Power Plant which is located next to mine is Poland's biggest power plant produces about 20% to 30% of Polish total energy production\n\nBrotherhood of Coal has regional chapters in Lublin region and Upper Silesia but its headquarters are located in Bełchatów due to central position\n\n§H============================================================\nWho are the characters?\n============================================================§!\n\nCharacters from this faction are mostly polish right-wing leaning journalists and media personalities that have openly taken their pro-coal stance in the ongoing political disputes\n\nRoksana Węgiel is one of the most succesfull young Polish popstars, and it's here only due to the fact that her surname in Polish means literally \"Coal\".\nSo we thought it would be funny if she was one of the characters that want to reform this state.\n\n§H============================================================\nWhat is this faction inspired by?\n============================================================§!\n\nThis faction is an obvious caricature of Brotherhood of Steel from the Fallout series, imprinted into the Polish state, which historically relied heavily on the coal\n\nIt takes inspiration from contemporary conflict in Polish politics regarding energetic transformation and shutting down our carbon imprint, in which characters from this faction are heavily invested in\n\n§H============================================================\nMiscellaneous lore details\n============================================================§!\n\nInside lore indicates three factions that formed the Brotherhood of Coal before start of the game; Republic of Bełchatów, Miners from the Bełchatów Mine and military personnel from the Łask Air Base\n\nBrotherhood of Coal provides the whole Dialogue Zone with electricity and coal supplies. They don't really want to, but for now it's pragmatic to participate in this alliance\n\nThere are rumors of some hidden cults worshipping coal and furnaces, but these are just rumors, right?\n\nSmog doesn't exists. And even if it does - it's good for you. It's a sign of progress after all. But be aware of some side effects\n\nSmog bricks are real though. There was some Chinese guy that used a vacuum cleaner to clean the air in one of China's cities and from the waste he made a brick. It was so beautifully Brotherhoody that we had to use it.\n"
