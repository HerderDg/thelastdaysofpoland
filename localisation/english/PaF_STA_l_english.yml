unification.127.t: "[GetNewspaper]Combine of Starachowice unifies Holy Cross!"
unification.127.desc: "Tyranny reigns in the Holy Cross Voivodeship no more. The dictator, Ziobro, has been toppled for good. Defiant against the General Prosecutor, the Combine of Starachowice managed to not only stop his advance in the War for the Northern Counties, not just deliver the death blow to his crumbling regime, but to stand tall above all other warlords, spreading the system of anarchic communism with each victory over the forces of statism. The entire voivodeship now finds itself adherent to this unknown style of government, able to participate in the first state-wide election to fill the seats of the temporarily vacant councils. While skepticism towards this new order still persists in its’ fullest, with the people no longer having an all-powerful state constantly breathing down their necks, they might just find themselves enjoying this newfound freedom."
unification.127.a: "No gods, no masters"

super.127.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
