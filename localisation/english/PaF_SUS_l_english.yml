 SUS_radio_three_not_sleeping: "Radio Three Doesn't Sleep"
 SUS_radio_three_not_sleeping_desc: "The radio station that’s in charge of intelligence operations and all of daily life in our state has been suffering from constant understaffing and other 'operational issues'. When its leader was questioned about his own department’s failures, the answer was frank and simple. Corruption was at fault and a Swiss Franc sourced from the station’s headquarters was proof of it. It shined as an example of our need to seriously consider taking immediate action against such practices."
 SUS_game_of_the_shadow: "Game of the Shadow"
 SUS_game_of_the_shadow_desc: "Our enemies never sleep, we know that well thanks to our leader. One of 'ours' named Piotrowicz was in fact a Russian spy of the Tsaritsa. The case was personally conducted by the Leader. During a search of Piotrowicz’s home a valuable, pre-war, brass samovar inscribed with cyrillic lettering was found. The text was later decoded by Our specialists from Three, to read “Tsaritsan”. Additionally it had a handle carved from amber. Such damning evidence leaves us no choice but to arrest him and thoroughly interrogate him. When we’re done with him, we’ll think of what to do next. What we do know however is that there is no place among us for hagglers.\nWe need to act now!"

unification.34.t: "[GetNewspaper]Grodzisk unites Northern Greater Poland"
unification.34.desc: "According to the latest news, the northern portion of Greater Poland has come under the control of prominent PiS politician Marek Suski and his Special Investigative Commission. Formed in the dark underground of the Eurokommissariats and tasked with uncovering the truth about the country’s collapse and those responsible for it, the committee provided many questions and few answers. Still, the destitute masses clung to the hope that the commission would one day be able to deliver justice for the millions that had their lives destroyed by the Fall, and with their full support, the statelet managed to fend off numerous attacks from more powerful warlords, while simultaneously carrying out an offensive that led to the region’s unification. \n\nDespite his growing stature, Suski maintains that his foremost goal remains finding the true reason behind Poland’s dissolution, in addition, of course, to the voivodeship’s reconstruction – one carried out with as much government involvement as possible."
unification.34.a: "Hopefully this investigation is more successful than his last"

super.34.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.34.a: "United at last."
