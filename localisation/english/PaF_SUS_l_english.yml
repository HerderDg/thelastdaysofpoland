 SUS_radio_three_not_sleeping_desc:0 "The radio station that’s in charge of intelligence operations and all of daily life in our state has been suffering from constant understaffing and other "operational issues". When its leader was questioned about his own department’s failures, the answer was frank and simple. Corruption was at fault and a Swiss Franc sourced from the station’s headquarters was proof of it. It shined as an example of our need to seriously consider taking immediate action against such practices."

 SUS_game_of_the_shadow_desc:0 "Our enemies never sleep, we know that well thanks to our leader. One of "ours" named Piotrowicz was in fact a Russian spy of the Tsaritsa. The case was personally conducted by the Leader. During a search of Piotrowicz’s home a valuable, pre-war, brass samovar inscribed with cyrillic lettering was found. The text was later decoded by Our specialists from Three, to read “Tsaritsan”. Additionally it had a handle carved from amber. Such damning evidence leaves us no choice but to arrest him and thoroughly interrogate him. When we’re done with him, we’ll think of what to do next. What we do know however is that there is no place among us for hagglers.\nWe need to act now!"

unification.34.desc:0 "The latest news from Southern Greaterpoland is that the entire region has come under the control of a former PiS prominent politician, Marek Suski, and his special commission investigating the collapse of Poland. \n\nThe commission, operating partly in the underground of Eurocommissariats in the Leszno area, until it formed its own state, where they began investigating the collapse case. Although the committee had many questions and few answers, they could not let go of military and other warlords' issues. As a result, they were able to fend off the threat from the stronger states in their region, while simultaneously carrying out their offensive that led to the unification of the region. \n\nSuski says straightforwardly that the most important goal of his commission is to study the collapse of our state, in addition to, of course, the reconstruction of the region, which will be carried out with as much government involvement as possible."
