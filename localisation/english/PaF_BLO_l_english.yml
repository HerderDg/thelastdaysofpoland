unification.167.t: "[GetNewspaper]Blockfellas unifies Capital Region"
unification.167.desc: "Grochów was on its way to becoming one of the more respected districts of Warsaw despite its troubled past. The Fall reversed this tendency and caused its inhabitants to return to their old violent tendencies. The old ways were needed for them to eventually win over Warsaw as the hooligans from Grochów reveled in the perspective of warfare among the blocks. The harsh, yet elastic moral code allowed them to raid other districts en masse to take needed resources and money. These feats allowed them to gradually build up their power base to eventually dominate other factions."
unification.167.a: "The emotions! Just like during car servicing"
