unification.172.t: "[GetNewspaper]Free Infoanarchist Communes unifies Łódź Voivodeship!"
unification.172.desc: "Mateusz "Tiger Bonzo" Kupiec for a long time functioned as a harmless buffoon, a questionable rapper who often threatened other warlords with cyberterrorism... in an era, when most of his neighbors were forced to part ways with computers and overreliance on electronics. His communes were supported by few loyal fans and innumerous genuine hackers and infoanarchist benefiting from a complete lack of restrictions. Not many would bet on their success, but maybe this underestimation by their opponents caused the unaccepted ascendence of Bonzo's clique. In a turn of events, Kupiec's saboteurs issued some successful attacks on the hostiles' power grid, his hackers were able to intercept enemy intel on a regular basis. His web-delivered message even inspired the creation of a few sleeping terrorist cells behind their opponents' backs, eventually dismantling all the hierarchies in Łódzkie, effectively making Tiger Bonzo the most influential man in the Voivodeship."
