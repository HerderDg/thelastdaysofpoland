TIG_digital_haven: "Digital Safe Haven"
TIG_digital_haven_desc: "Aside from the leader and his questionable mental capacity, the territories of the Communes are inhabited by numerous talented hackers and computer experts who prefer to operate outside stricter jurisdictions that other Łódzkie warlords provide. They’ve learned to fend for themselves and sell their services on the darknet, often engaging in grey or black market activities. They are determined to support the anarchist cause with cyberwarfare against all those who’d like to infringe on their newly acquired freedom."

unification.172.t: "[GetNewspaper]Free Infoanarchist Communes unify Łódzkie!"
unification.172.desc: "For a long time, Mateusz \"Tiger Bonzo\" Kupiec functioned only as a harmless buffoon, a questionable rapper who often threatened other warlords with cyberterrorism... in an era when most of his neighbors were forced to part ways with computers and end their overreliance on electronics. His communes were supported by a few loyal fans, genuine hackers, and infoanarchist benefiting from a complete lack of restrictions. Not many would bet on their success, but maybe this underestimation by their opponents caused the unexpected ascendence of Bonzo's clique. In a wild turn of events, Kupiec's saboteurs launched successful attacks on the hostiles' power grid, his hackers able to intercept enemy intel on a regular basis. His web-delivered message even inspired the creation of a few sleeping terrorist cells behind their opponents' backs, eventually dismantling all hierarchies in Łódzkie, effectively making Tiger Bonzo the most influential man in the Voivodeship."
unification.172.a: "Unification... sorta thing, bang."
