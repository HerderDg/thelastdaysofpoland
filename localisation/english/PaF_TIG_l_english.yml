unification.172.t: "[GetNewspaper]Free Infoanarchist Communes unify Łódzkie!"
unification.172.desc: "For a long time, Mateusz "Tiger Bonzo" Kupiec functioned only as a harmless buffoon, a questionable rapper who often threatened other warlords with cyberterrorism... in an era when most of his neighbors were forced to part ways with computers and end their overreliance on electronics. His communes were supported by a few loyal fans, genuine hackers, and infoanarchist benefiting from a complete lack of restrictions. Not many would bet on their success, but maybe this underestimation by their opponents caused the unexpected ascendence of Bonzo's clique. In a wild turn of events, Kupiec's saboteurs launched successful attacks on the hostiles' power grid, his hackers able to intercept enemy intel on a regular basis. His web-delivered message even inspired the creation of a few sleeping terrorist cells behind their opponents' backs, eventually dismantling all hierarchies in Łódzkie, effectively making Tiger Bonzo the most influential man in the Voivodeship."
unification.172.a: "Unification... sorta thing, bang."
