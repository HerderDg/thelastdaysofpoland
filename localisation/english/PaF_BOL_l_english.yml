POLITICS_LECH_WALESA_DESC: "The destiny of some is to be great, no matter how low they started. And no matter how capable they are of greatness. \n\nLech Wałęsa, a simple yet charismatic electrician, led a Solidarity revolution that shook the communist regime. He managed to guide tumultous and divided opposition through thick and thin, and even though it took nine long years of repression, he prevailed. Posed against his image and authority, communist party tried to gamble, but ended up gradually relinquishing power. Wałęsa, triumphant, became president. \n\nThis apex did not last long. Transformation was painful, communists did not face retribution, Solidarity camp was divided, and streetwise, swollen-headed Wałęsa bumbled across newborn Polish democracy with little grace and respect for his former comrades, including the Kaczyński brothers. After failing to secure second term in office, Lech’s political career flew down the flush. By the time Jarosław Kaczyński, still holding old grudges, reached for power in 2015, Wałęsa was reduced to an inflatable balloon displayed at opposition rallies. \n\nAn ordinary person would buckle under the weight of guilt imposed on Wałęsa. Old leader, however, seems to disregard any slander and criticism, starting with his primordial sin of cooperation with secret police in early 70’ and ending with the present Fall of Poland. Vehemently convinced of his unique, pivotal role in toppling communism, Wałęsa still believes that at the end of his life he will make that leap once again and bring his homeland back from the brink of destruction. \n\nHe doesn’t wanna, but he has to."

unification.85.t: "[GetNewspaper]Solidarity unifies Pomerelia!"
unification.85.desc: "Now tell me where you’ve heard this one before: Solidarność in Gdańsk? Ring any bells? Well it should, even more so in recent days as a great dose of Deja Vu comes rushing to us over radio waves and oh so expensive printer ink. Lech Wałęsa along with Solidarność have managed to restore order to the region of Pomerelia in the past weeks. Many may recall the collapse of the Eurokomissariats; the chaos and fears of the region falling into complete anarchy and banditry. Though that may have been true to some extent, it also set the stage for many others to take the stage in Pomerelia, Lech Wałęsa being chief among them. Wałęsa became a beacon of hope in the remains of the German Intervention’s territories, experiencing an unexpected surge in popularity which helped rally people to his cause. So we’ll watch on then, as yet another familiar face appears on the board of Post-Fall Poland."
