unification.188.t: "[GetNewspaper]Warriors of ŁKS unify Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.188.desc: "Poland is home to many rivalries so long-standing that few people expect them to ever end. One such feud pitted two of the oldest Polish football clubs - ŁKS and Widzew in an unending struggle for local and national dominance. Their conflicts, which in recent years gained additional political significance, were finally resolved when ŁKS dominated their enemies. Then, having annihilated the object of their obsession, they looked upon the larger world. With newly-found hope, they wasted no time and challenged the other neighboring warlords. Now, the 'Knights of the Spring' freely roam Łódzkie, violently harassing all 'non-native Łodzians,' which usually means all those who look at them even remotely funny. While their eternal enemies tried desperately to reinvent their identity in the wake of the Fall, the success of the ŁKS ultras' militia proves that sometimes the simplicity of the old ways is the best way to achieve goals."
