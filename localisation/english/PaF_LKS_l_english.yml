LKS_great_derby: "Great Łódź Derby"
LKS_great_derby_desc: "The history of rivalization between RTS Widzew and ŁKS Łódź – one of the oldest football clubs in Poland reaches back to 1911. From that time their feud became as great as the clubs themselves, often resulting in violent fights between the fans of each of the associations long before 2025. The total collapse of moral norms after the Fall further ignited the passion as the two clubs were reorganized into a semi-state structures that started to wage regular war between each other."

LKS_memories_of_failure: "Memories of failure"
LKS_memories_of_failure_desc: "The ŁKS fans may never admit that, but it’s not an equal fight there in. It never has been. Ever since the feud between the clubs started Widzew has been more successful at football and more popular of the two. The former hurt the Knights of Spring more before the Fall, the latter harmed them recently when the superior numbers of Widzew Hooligans driven ŁKS away from their stronghold in Piotrków Trybunalski, causing them to lose much of their relevance on the Voivodeship stage. While that doesn’t dissuade the ŁKS Ultras, the recency of the failure make civilian population much less enthusiastic about engaging in future conflicts."

LKS_guerilla_tactics: "Guerilla tactics"
LKS_guerilla_tactics_desc: "Due to the Truce between Widzew and ŁKS, which Hołownia oversaw and the lack of resources the Red-White-Red Ultras had to find a way to channel their aggression in acceptable manner. Instead of engaging in an open war, they’ve been sending unmarked warriors beyond Widzew’s borders to wreak havoc on their territory, while being helped by the friendly local population of Wolbórz, Piotrków and Sulejów. Those who come back from those raids later instruct those who stayed in the way of the partisan."

unification.188.t: "[GetNewspaper]Warriors of ŁKS unify Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.188.desc: "Poland is home to many rivalries so long-standing that few people expect them to ever end. One such feud pitted two of the oldest Polish football clubs - ŁKS and Widzew in an unending struggle for local and national dominance. Their conflicts, which in recent years gained additional political significance, were finally resolved when ŁKS dominated their enemies. Then, having annihilated the object of their obsession, they looked upon the larger world. With newly-found hope, they wasted no time and challenged the other neighboring warlords. Now, the 'Knights of the Spring' freely roam Łódzkie, violently harassing all 'non-native Łodzians,' which usually means all those who look at them even remotely funny. While their eternal enemies tried desperately to reinvent their identity in the wake of the Fall, the success of the ŁKS ultras' militia proves that sometimes the simplicity of the old ways is the best way to achieve goals."
unification.188.a: "And the native Łodzians have just scored their first."
