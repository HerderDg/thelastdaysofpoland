unification.69.t: "[GetNewspaper]11th Armoured Cavalry Division unifies Legnickie!"
unification.69.desc: "Those that once started the Eurokommissariats' demise have at last vanquished their remnants, at least within the borders of Legnickie. The 11th Armored Cavalry Division – the first brave souls to rebel against Tusk's regime, have managed to seize upon their initial charge's momentum and consolidate the region despite heavy opposition from German-aligned forces and the opportunists that broke free after Schlesien's collapse. Yet, while the victorious unit's general – Piotr Trytek, aims to mold his image into that of a liberator in order to unite the population behind his military leadership, the legacy of a turncoat follows his every step. Crimes against the nation are not easily forgotten, and for Trytek, the Oder was his Rubicon. A traitor to both Poles and Germans, the general can only press forward in hopes that he may one day restore the country he helped shatter. Maybe his countrymen can forgive him then, at least."
unification.69.a: "The march of the Tankists begins."
