unification.23.t: "[GetNewspaper][FROM.GetName] unifies Upper Silesia!"
unification.23.desc: "The black gold of the Polish land forever defined the image of the Silesian region. Rapid industrialization led to the creation of such behemoths as the Jastrzębian Coal Company, and few could expect that in 2027 it is the coal corporation that will decide the fate of Upper Silesia. With the heavy influence of trade unions, miners are following a traditionalist path that puts coal on the pedestal of the population's priorities.\n\nSurely Silesia will not freeze to death, but will it be able to convince the rest of Poland that mining is not dead yet? [FROM.GetLeader] is determined to lead Poland to the next industrial revolution, which will permanently seal our country's position as a key industrial player in Europe. But how long will coal continue to fuel the region's economy?"
unification.23.a: "Not all the coal that is dug warms the world!"


super_a.23.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super_a.23.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super_a.23.a: "United at last."
