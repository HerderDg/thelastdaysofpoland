unification.23.t: "[GetNewspaper]Jastrzębie Coal Company unites Silesian Metropolis!"
unification.23.desc: "The image of the Silesian region has been forever defined by the black gold underneath its soil. With rapid industrialization leading to the creation of economic behemoths centered around the exploitation of this precious resource, it is no wonder that some of the most influential corporations - the Jastrzębie Coal Company chief among them, played a part in deciding Upper Silesia's fate after it shattered like the rest of the country. \n\nNow that continuous extraction has been secured, Silesia is at least certain not to freeze to death itself, but will it be able to convince the rest of Poland that mining is not yet dead? Towing the traditionalist line, putting coal on the pedestal of the population's priorities, and with the heavy influence of the trade unions and the miners themselves, [FROM.GetLeader] is determined to lead Poland into the next industrial revolution. But for how long can a depleting resource fuel the region's economy?"
unification.23.a: "Not all the coal that is dug warms the world!"

Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
