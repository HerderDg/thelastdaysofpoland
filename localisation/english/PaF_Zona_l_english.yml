Zona_desc: "§HStare Bałuty. 13th of June, 2025.§! \n\n§WGrażyna and her husband are enjoying their minced meatchops and watching Familiada, when suddenly - they, their dinner, their apartment block and the entire neighbourhood get wiped off the face of Earth as a second sun rises above most of the Łódź Voivodeship, causing the already dying Poland to disintegrate completely and sparking the German-led EU intervention that was meant to put the country back in charge of itself.§! \n\n...50000 people used to live here.\nNow it's a ghost town."
BBW_Zona_desc: "Bałuty, a festering scar on the face of Poland, on the face of the world, now safely contained behind the walls of the Sarcophagus. Some may believe they hear noise from inside those wretched walls, but they would never have the courage to ask anyone about it. Lone infront of the only gate inside stands a grand statue, built of marble and wrought metal. Proudly, with an unmoving face Tomasz Sommer stands amongst miners, mourning the cataclysm, just as the citizens mounred his passing. \n\n May another Nuclear Holocaust never happen here, nor anywhere across the world."
Bieszczady_desc: "§WAhhh... the beatiful Bieszczady Mountains - a very picturesque and sparsely populated region, devoid of any infrastructure or organised authority. \n\nMost of the local population has fled abroad to Slovakia and Ukraine, their homes and farms now being overtaken by wild animals - the new rulers of this abandoned region. Patrol groups from Krosno, Lesko and Przemyśl often try to encroach on their territory only to run back home with bagged corpses of their comrades who've been mutilated by bears and wolves.§! \n\n§HAnd that's how life goes slowly, here in Bieszczady.§!"
Germany_desc: "§WGermany hangs from its noose of repression, the dream of a unified Europe shattered into hundreds of little pieces. As the blood of warring statelets stains the black and yellow with uneven patches of red, the nation descends further towards a calamity even greater than that it had pushed its eastern neighbor into.\nGray clouds of smoke rise from cities ravaged by populations turned into rabid hoarders and worse. Refugees tell tales of bandits and radicals seizing whatever piece of land can be clawed from the fallen government's corpse.\nA looping track of Deutschlandlied airing across national radio stands as the only reminder of a united Germany's near half a century in the sun.§!"

baluty_bbw.1.t: "Project 'Sarcophagus'"
baluty_bbw.1.desc: "This Exclusion Zone, while a dreary reminder of the atomic holocaust brought by the fanatic fascination with splitting the atom (or so the Elder would say), is never truly left alone. Lowlifes, stalkers, peddlers of anti-nuclear medicine, they all gather around this place like flies. Turns out the one thing the Brotherhood hates more than atomic power is a disorderly territory. The Sarcophagus project had a twofold purpose: Not only to be a memorial but to limit radiation emissions sufficiently to start excavating for resources. \n\nTeam ANT1 was the first one to depart: Brave engineers and military scouts, all well-equipped to swat away any bandit or anarchist trying to desperately make a fortune in the exclusion zone. Their goal was simple: Survey the land in preparation for excavation. With the Sarcophagus limiting the radiation output, it was well possible that they'd go home in one piece."
baluty_bbw.1.a: "Their souls would appreciate that."

baluty_bbw.2.t: "A Curious Find"
baluty_bbw.2.desc: "We've combed through the Zone like a fine toothbrush, coming into contact with various locals at ten different occasions: Six armed bands of robbers and four unaffiliated groups, none of them posing any real threat to the well-trained team of soldiers. Zero casualties on our side. \n\n...And also zero relevant loot. The survey of the Zone has revealed no known natural resources: No coal of any grade, no iron nor any rarer minerals. However, we've found something far more interesting than even the potential discovery of coal would provide - a whole new ore has been excavated, speculated to be a byproduct of radiation! \n\nHandled with care, ore samples have been carefully packaged and delivered to our best laboratories for examination. While it isn't coal of any sort, we are still eager to uncover its properties - if it can't be used for energy due to ideological concerns, this new material can nonetheless be utilized for military purposes in the same way we allow ourselves to use ammunition containing depleted uranium. Actually, depleted uranium is the closest thing we can think of when initially examining this material. Attached are exact geometric measures for each quadrant of the Zone."
