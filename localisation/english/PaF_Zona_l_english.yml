 Zona_desc: "§HStare Bałuty. 23rd of August, 2025.§! \n\n§WGrażyna and her husband are enjoying their minced meatchops and watching Familiada, when suddenly - they, their dinner, their apartment block and the entire neighbourhood get wiped off the face of Earth as a second sun rises above most of the Łódź Voivodeship, causing the already dying Poland to disintegrate completely and sparking the German-led EU intervention that was meant to put the country back in charge of itself.§! \n\n...50000 people used to live here.\nNow it's a ghost town."

Bandits.§! \n\n§WAs state apparatus stopped functioning in the region, some brutes banded together and started raiding neighbouring houses and villages for money, jewelry, cars and TVs. Many followed in their footsteps, first to enrich themselves as well, then to take back what was stolen from them by others.§! §tAnd there's no sign of any evolving authority that could finally stop this practice once and for all.§!"
 Bieszczady_desc: "§WAhhh... the beatiful Bieszczady Mountains - a very picturesque and sparsely populated region, devoid of any infrastructure or organised authority. \n\nMost of the local population has fled abroad to Slovakia and Ukraine, their homes and farms now being overtaken by wild animals - the new rulers of this abandoned region. Patrol groups from Krosno, Lesko and Przemyśl often try to encroach on their territory only to run back home with bagged corpses of their comrades who've been mutilated by bears and wolves.§! \n\n§HAnd that's how life goes slowly, here in Bieszczady.§!"

baluty_bbw.1.t: "Project 'Sarcophagus'"
baluty_bbw.1.desc: "This Exclusion Zone, while a dreary reminder of the atomic holocaust brought by the fanatic fascination with splitting the atom (or so the Elder would say), is never truly left alone. Lowlifes, stalkers, peddlers of anti-nuclear medicine, they all gather around this place like flies. Turns out the one thing the Brotherhood hates more than atomic power is a disorderly territory. The Sarcophagus project had a twofold purpose: Not only to be a memorial but to limit radiation emissions sufficiently to start excavating for resources. \n\nTeam ANT1 was the first one to depart: Brave engineers and military scouts, all well-equipped to swat away any bandit or anarchist trying to desperately make a fortune in the exclusion zone. Their goal was simple: Survey the land in preparation for excavation. With the Sarcophagus limiting the radiation output, it was well possible that they’d go home in one piece."

baluty_bbw.2.t: "A Curious Find"
baluty_bbw.2.desc: "We've combed through the Zone like a fine toothbrush, coming into contact with various locals at ten different occasions: Six armed bands of robbers and four unaffiliated groups, none of them posing any real threat to the well-trained team of soldiers. Zero casualties on our side. \n\n...And also zero relevant loot. The survey of the Zone has revealed no known natural resources: No coal of any grade, no iron nor any rarer minerals. However, we've found something far more interesting than even the potential discovery of coal would provide - a whole new ore has been excavated, speculated to be a byproduct of radiation! \n\nHandled with care, ore samples have been carefully packaged and delivered to our best laboratories for examination. While it isn’t coal of any sort, we are still eager to uncover its properties - if it can’t be used for energy due to ideological concerns, this new material can nonetheless be utilized for military purposes in the same way we allow ourselves to use ammunition containing depleted uranium. Actually, depleted uranium is the closest thing we can think of when initially examining this material. Attached are exact geometric measures for each quadrant of the Zone."
