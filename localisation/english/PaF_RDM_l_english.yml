unification.193.t: "[GetNewspaper]Republic of Radomsko unifies Łódź Voivodeship!"
unification.193.desc: "The trauma of the Fall, combined with the tragedy of Bałuty, resulted in Łódzkie becoming a breeding ground for the most outlandish and radical factions known to man. Because of that, many overlooked the unsuspecting and ordinary final vestige of the former government's control over the region, co-ruled by the three last voivodes. Initially, they tried to simply take control over the Łódź metropolis, yet with the general instability that followed the nuclear catastrophe and the liberal leanings of the city’s population, their endeavor proved unsuccessful. They were forced to retreat to Radomsko, a conservative stronghold on the edge of the voivodeship. Rising from the bottom, they gradually built their support in the province and eventually managed to dominate it. Even the defiant Łódź has since accepted their policy - either due to the adoption of liberal conservatism by the new elites, or because other warlords showed them how just bad things could’ve been instead."
unification.193.a: "Democracy wins out in Łódzkie."
