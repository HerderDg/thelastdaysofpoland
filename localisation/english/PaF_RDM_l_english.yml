RDM_diplomatic_cadres: "Diplomatic Cadres"
RDM_diplomatic_cadres_desc: "Thanks to Bocheński’s mentor, Zbiegniew Rau - the former minister of foreign affairs, the Republic of Radomsko can pride itself in a quite robust diplomatic core. This coupled with it’s with the fact that the Republic’s government is comprised mainly by new blood of Law and Justice party, unburdened with the past, enables Radomsko to maintain a network of diplomatic contacts. They are already considered to be one of the most staunch adherents to the doctrine of Dialogue outside of City of Łódź."
RDM_sore_loser: "Sore Loser"
RDM_sore_loser_desc: "They can do as many rebrandings as they want. The fact is the so-called Republic is a pitiful remnant of the whole Łódź Voivodeship. In a matter of weeks, Law and Justice hold over the region decreased about 12 times and the former Voivode, Tobiasz Bocheński is to blame. Everyone seems to know that and that severely dimishes people’s faith in the new Republic especially in how it would fare in a potential conflict."

unification.193.t: "[GetNewspaper]Republic of Radomsko unifies Łódź Voivodeship!"
unification.193.desc: "The trauma of the Fall, combined with the tragedy of Bałuty, resulted in Łódzkie becoming a breeding ground for the most outlandish and radical factions known to man. Because of that, many overlooked the unsuspecting and ordinary final vestige of the former government's control over the region, co-ruled by the three last voivodes. Initially, they tried to simply take control over the Łódź metropolis, yet with the general instability that followed the nuclear catastrophe and the liberal leanings of the city’s population, their endeavor proved unsuccessful. They were forced to retreat to Radomsko, a conservative stronghold on the edge of the voivodeship. Rising from the bottom, they gradually built their support in the province and eventually managed to dominate it. Even the defiant Łódź has since accepted their policy - either due to the adoption of liberal conservatism by the new elites, or because other warlords showed them how just bad things could’ve been instead."
unification.193.a: "Democracy wins out in Łódzkie."
