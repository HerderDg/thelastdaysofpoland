unification.118.t: "[GetNewspaper]Commune of Wawer unifies the Capital District!"
unification.118.desc: "While most within Poland are blinded by their lust for power, fighting merely to impose their will over the nation, there still remain those who strive for something greater. As petty warlords send thousands to die in vain, the very earth that welcomes their corpses is dying underneath their feet. Worse yet, some within the country strive to accelerate this decay, oblivious that they're only bringing forth their own demise. Yet perhaps, nature might still be saved, as Poland's heart - the Capital District, has been overtaken by environmentalist forces of the enigmatic Wawer Commune. Ever since its capture, Warsaw has been rapidly transformed, with factories shut down, car traffic banned, and those found responsible for damaging the climate placed before sham trials. And though the greater goals of this state and even their leader's true identity remain a mystery, one thing can be said for certain - the green militia will not rest until all polluters have been brought to justice."
unification.118.a: "Only the most radical solutions can save our planet"

super.118.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.118.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.118.a: "United at last."
