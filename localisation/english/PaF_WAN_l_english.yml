unification.66.t: "[GetNewspaper]Vandals unify Opolskie!"
unification.66.desc: "Today Opole was place where an extraordinary event happened, where soldiers dressed in tribal suits marched across Old City. Their rhytmic drums, along with fifes made a spectacle for the masses. Szydłowski, self-proclaimed Chief of Vandal Tribe, has started along with his soldiers seizing catholic church property. Right now it is unknown, if his 'Warband' will be able to convince populace of Voivodeship to his rightful rule over newly gained territories. Although, what is known is that Opolskie Voivodeship just got under 'new management'. But this reign may prove problematic, both for Szydłowski and his followers, as well as for the citizens of Opolskie. The new rulers have already started implementing their own laws, which include mandatory pagan rituals, as well as banning of christian practices. This has led to unrest among the population, with some citizens even attempting to resist the new order. It remains to be seen how Szydłowski and his Warband will handle this new situation."

Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland.
