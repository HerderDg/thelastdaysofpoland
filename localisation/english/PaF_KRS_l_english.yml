 KRS_lack_of_legitimacy_desc: "Every state, regardless of their type or form, needs mainly one thing to stay in power - legitimacy. The precious luxury that we unfortunately cannot afford even with all the money in the world. Not really surprising, barring that the Consortium's government is composed mainly of three groups, which aren’t all especially reputable. While our only achievement so far is implementing barely "some" semblance of order and stability."

Rumors of white vans taking people of all kinds at night and driving of to God-Knows-Where are the town's latest hot talk.

 KRS_armed_banditry: "Armed Banditry"
 KRS_armed_banditry_desc: "The Consortium's borders have always been frequented by border reavers from Gniezno and Skierniewice, rogue scouts and marauding Calisian auxiliary warriors.

 KRS_bandits_bought_out: "Buy out Bandits"
 KRS_bandits_bought_out_desc: "If you can't beat them, buy them. The fierce milieu of the criminal underworld gave birth to many hardened criminals, who can teach our mercenaries a thing or two."

 KRS_economic_stagnation: "Economic Stagnation"
 KRS_economic_stagnation_desc: "After the initial surge of income following the seizure of lands in Northwestern Łódzkie, the Triumvirate's economic growth has been slowing down, and now the trio in Krośniewice must look for ways to quickly increase their revenue in a way that won't turn the population’s ire against them."

 KRS_tulip_farms: "Tulip Farms"
 KRS_tulip_farms_desc: "All across the Consortium, unused patches of grassland and old, abandoned fields are being turned by H. Skrzydlewska into tulip farms for profit. Rows of colorful flowers line every road crisscrossing the region. Pink, orange, yellow, red, all the colors one could imagine can be found dotted about, making the scenery look stunning as a bonus."

 KRS_lab_no_3: "Laboratory No. 3"
 KRS_lab_no_3_desc: "An enormous facility conducting top secret experiments. Few know what actually happens there, but since it's establishment Ebrantil's private forces are growing due to the influx of suspiciously quiet volunteers."

 KRS_chemical_doping: "Chemical Doping"
 KRS_chemical_doping_desc: "Administering drugs to our soldiers greatly increases their battle capabilities, though delivering in high amounts to the frontline is a pain in our logisticians' necks." 
 KRS_chemical_doping_2: "Chemical Doping & Warfare"
 KRS_chemical_doping_2_desc: "Why bother with administering the drugs to our soldiers directly, when we can simply use our war gas dispensers on them. We just have to remember which dispensers are to by directed at our boys and which are for the enemy." 
 KRS_human_experiments: "Human Experiments"
 KRS_human_experiments_desc: "Subtle enhancements to the genome and administering the right hormones will allow us to conscript the people, who would otherwise be unfit to join our military ranks."

KRS_up_in_the_town_of_krosniewice_desc: "Up in the town of Krośniewice, a group of three parties meet, \nThe Businessman, The Detective and The Paramedic elite,\nThey shake hands, a fair deal they quickly settle,\nTo the Triumvirate, they freely submit their mettle."
KRS_the_new_agenda_desc: "Our state is plagued with countless problems and all of us know that well, so that’s why a meeting is in order. All three parties in one place to discuss all that ails us and what’s the ointment to aid us. Each and every matter of state, every problem. We will do our best."
KRS_lock_the_doors_desc: "If we are to meet, we’ll need utmost security and who’s better to do that than Rutkowski’s men. His agents will be just the people needed to keep everyone out and keep whatever happens in. We must ensure that our dealings are kept as professional as could be. Hey, we might impress the parties involved if we try hard enough."
KRS_and_begin_the_meeting_desc: "Let our meeting begin! There are alot of things to discuss and a lot of problems to tackle on our first official gathering. Disappearances, Bandits and even just Refugees from worse parts of Poland, or those seeking to travel to the Eurocomissariats are just three of our pressing issues. And for better or for worse, everyone has their own ideas for solving these problems, which makes it abundantly clear that keeping this Triumvirate in balance will be harder than we had previously thought."
KRS_fixin_our_problems_desc: "Crime, the scourge that affects not only our populace, but also reflects poorly on us. This wave of lawlessness spurred by the Fall must be stopped and prevented from happening again. Getting rid of petty criminals is the first step in eliminating these crippling issues from our state. We’ll see what solutions are put forward..."
KRS_educating_civil_servants_desc: "Now, let us talk about preventative measures. We need a more effective system of law enforcement and we need it now. Sure we can buy them all sorts of fancy gear, but what worth is it if they don’t know how to effectively use it? That’s why we’ll need to give them a proper education, not whatever bottom of the barrel course they had to pass to get their cozy job."
KRS_destroying_crime_desc: "The final piece of the puzzle for which we are now adequately prepared for is the goal of completely destroying any bandit activity in our region. Our well educated and well armed law enforcement will have no pity as it pacifies our lands, cracking down on any armed dissenters. The people will surely thank us for finally putting an end to this menace."
KRS_invest_in_a_megaproject_desc: "Every great nation has its grand monuments; amazing works of humankind’s labor and to show that we are a prestigious state, even more so that the ones around us, we shall create a Megaproject of our own. It surely won’t be an easy feat, however when we finish it, everyone will see that we are a beacon of progress and that our cause is one worth supporting."
KRS_conclude_the_meeting_desc: "Now that everything’s over and done with, we can finish our meeting. Licking our admittedly grievous wounds was just the first step however. We can now properly move onto cementing our position in the Voivodeship.\nLet’s hope that the future is not too unkind to us."
KRS_expand_the_patrol_desc: "Rutkowski’s Patrol has so far been an integral part of our state’s law enforcement, serving as detectives leagues better than whatever remains of the Police remain. Due to their skill a proposal has been put forward by Rutkowski, suggesting we allow for the creation of a new branch of his organization. The new branch would focus on leading proper military training for our soldier boys to improve upon our currently very ad-hoc method of training troops."
KRS_prepare_the_airfields_desc: "If war will come to Łódzkie Voivodeship, then we cannot be caught unprepared in the wake of whatever conflict is to come. Our state is littered with all sorts of small airfields which could be repurposed for military use. Fielding more aircraft would be invaluable, as aerial support will greatly bolster our military might, without needing many more men. And besides, it’s not like anyone was actually using those airfields in the first place."
KRS_old_police_weapons_desc: "The Police left behind some pretty nifty toys for our boys to have fun with, so why not make use of them? They might not be top of the line machine guns, but they are high quality firearms regardless. Issue is, almost all of them haven’t been maintained for a very long time now and have fallen into disrepair. We will organize new weapon workshops to fix all of them right up. As a bonus we can later use the same workshops to create brand new guns."
KRS_no_time_to_lose_desc: "Tick, Tock, Tick, Tock...Time is money and we’ve spent all that we can afford. After all of our discussions and all of our preparations we hope we have done enough. We can’t delay any longer. It is time to assert our position as the true rulers of the Voivodeship.\nThe Triumvirate will triumph above everyone else."
KRS_guardin_our_interests_desc: "We need an army, there are no doubts about it. The country has spiraled so far out of control, it is basically impossible to get anything done without a swarm of armed men around you. A standing force should be one of our priorities if we want to assert ourselves as a serious component for the mantle of Łódzkie’s leader."
KRS_controlling_the_border_desc: "Our close proximity to the Eurocomissariats may be considered a boon for some, however it has brought upon more issues than we expected. Waves of refugees from the east constantly travel through our land, slowing down our implementation of law and destabilizing our nation further. There’s something that needs to be done about this issue of ours."
KRS_standard_training_programmes_desc: "Now that the more serious matters are out of the way, we can think about protecting ourselves and not just our whole state as a whole. A private security force for our top leaders needs to be organized, so that they don’t end up as victims of some crazed assassin, or one of the mysterious kidnappers plaguing our lands."
KRS_uppin_our_revenue_desc: "Money, we need it and we need a lot of it. Any state does, how can we buy just about anything from basic resources for our people to advanced tanks for our forces without a steady source of income? That’s why we need to decide on what industries to build up or expand to get this cash."
KRS_contracts_from_abroad_desc: "All of our three groups (surprisingly) agree on one thing - that we are businessmen and running a business on just the local level is really not profitable. Coming to a consensus was not hard, we must expand our ventures to the lands of other warlords. We’ll reach out a seemingly helpful hand, to goad them into coughing up cash for our oh so important services."
KRS_aquiring_resources_desc: "As part of our economic expansion, and the sheer fact the land we carved out for ourselves is not very bountiful has led us to needing more raw materials than we had accounted for. This unexpected problem needs to be solved post haste, unless we wish to risk an economic slowdown."
KRS_battle_for_lodzkie_desc: "Despite Hołownia’s efforts, war in Łódzkie is practically inevitable. We must prepare ourselves to defend our state from anyone wanting to claim it for themselves. We shall create a system of defenses on our borders, everyone who dares test us, will crash and burn trying to break through our lines."
KRS_divert_our_assets_desc: "Currently a lot of our factories are sitting around producing useless junk, instead of making things that will actually benefit us in any meaningful way. Who needs their third microwave, when we could be making rifles for our men instead? Refitting factories that are currently just a drain on our workforce into producing war supplies will put us one step ahead of everyone else in terms of producing weapons."
KRS_patch_the_holes_in_our_logistics_desc: "Supplies do not just magically appear in our soldier’s hands, so we need to fix that with the wonderful world of supply logistics. The issue however is, that we lack the means to transport our gear to the front. To remedy this issue, we’ll produce more transport vehicles. Soon brand new trucks and trains will be transporting our military goods all around our territories."
KRS_establish_a_supply_line_desc: "Well supplied armies are a real force to be reckoned with, so to further bolster our logistics capabilities, we will establish an organized system of supply lines to our fronts. Our soldiers will be able to fight for longer and won’t have to fear running out of bullets in the middle of nowhere, tens of kilometers away from the nearest supply hub."
KRS_establish_an_auxiliary_corps_desc: "A good way to encourage our people to aid in our effort is to create a well paid auxiliary corps. Even some unemployed nobody who simply grabs a shovel and helps us dig anti-tank ditches will be a great help, without needing much in the way of training or advanced skills. When push comes to shove, some of them might even decide to help bolster our army by joining its ranks when their work as auxiliaries ends."
KRS_comfort_families_desc: "Every day since the Fall, people have been dying en masse because of all the chaos that sweeps across the bloody remains of Poland. This has been a huge drain on the morale of our population, to say the least. In order to try and lessen the impact of these turbulent times, we will put on a smile and reimburse our population for the loss of loved ones and any grievous injuries. To curry favors with them of course."
KRS_why_we_fight_desc: "Why do We fight? Is it for wealth? Is it for fame? No, We fight because we must. We are the only ones that can bring back stability and prosperity to this rotting corpse of a once great nation! We need to face adversity from all directions, from all ideals, from old friends and from new enemies! We don’t fight for personal gain, we fight so that the white eagle can soar once more in the skies of Europe!"
KRS_detectives_ready_for_action_desc: "It goes without saying that Rutkowski’s Detectives are incredibly skilled in their field, and their discipline is simply top notch, hence we have decided to employ them as special forces on the front. With a bit of training and some fancy branded military gear highlighting their uniqueness, they will truly stand out from the rest in our army’s ranks."
KRS_conscript_women_desc: "Lack of manpower is an ever present issue in just about any army, including ours.Given this fact, we must make up for this deficit by allowing women to serve within our ranks, and not just men. Well, allow is a bit of an understatement..."
KRS_pass_out_the_pitchforks_desc: "We need more men. Oh so much more than we have currently. No price is too big to pay for our victory in Łódzkie. We will rally everyone, each and every person in our state. Even if they have to share three guns for a whole battalion, we will get them to the front. We will get farmers, drunks, the poor and the homeless, we will have them fight because that is all that we’ve got."
KRS_roll_out_the_paramedics_desc: "Having paramedics assist our soldiers on the front will be very useful in keeping our army from slowly bleeding men. They will establish field hospitals for our men, in which they’ll hopefully get treated well... We don’t want our men looking like WW1 veterans after one single scratch on their leg..."
KRS_experimental_concoctions_desc: "Pervitin and other amphetamines have long been used on the fronts of many, many battles since their conception, so how about we make some of our own? It worked back then, so why would it be a bad idea now? Soldiers that are energetic and ready for battle all around the clock will be a true blessing... We just shouldn’t tell them what we are actually giving them..."
KRS_poisonous_gasses_desc: "Why should we only look to the past when it comes to doping our soldiers? So many wondrous weapons have long been abandoned in the past! Chemical Warfare, while frowned upon, is a true marvel. Who these days has a spare gas mask just lying around? No one is the answer. That’s why using a few less ethical solutions here and there will be just what we need..."
KRS_complex_submolecular_modifications_desc: "Genetic Modification, it just sounds so… unreal… so impossible. It sounds like some far off concept ripped straight out of a space opera, however minor modifications would not be that terribly difficult to accomplish. Given this, we could “modify” some people less fit for service so that they can make it above the minimum requirements to join."
KRS_unleash_the_terrors_desc: "We might have pushed genetically modifying our soldiers a bit too far... At this point it’s hard to call them human. They are completely obedient, they are harder, better, faster, stronger... which would be all well and good... if they didn’t act like savage beasts."

KRS_all_hell_is_breaking_loose_desc: "The lines have been drawn, the guns have been prepared, and the entire voivodeship is gearing up for war. Initial skirmishes between the warlords had already erupted and we needed to prepare our population for an inevitable time of sacrifice.\n\n\nThis will be awful for our profits."
KRS_fortify_our_cities_desc: "Analytics from Rutkowski's Patrol have designated the most populated towns in our lands as critical strongpoints which we should fortify.\nBarricades will be built, trenches will be dug and even houses will be reinforced to make sure that any enemy will think twice before attacking them head-on."
KRS_gather_the_war_council_desc: "The clock is ticking, the top brass of the Clique needs to gather and figure out any potential measures that can help us in case of an armed conflict. We need all hands on deck, anything goes and no idea is a bad one. Whatever crystallizes from this will meeting will have to do, for the good of the Triumvirate."
KRS_skrzydlewski_heritage_desc: "Old Skrzydlewski had a vision.\nA network of flower shops and funeral parlors all around the country, providing beautiful house decorations and funeral services to people in all corners of Poland. He worked his entire life to make that dream come true.\n\nNaturally, after The Fall, his company came upon troubled waters, with many warlords closing his stores and outright seizing them.\nHowever, all that left him a giant logistics fleet, full of distinct blue and white trucks.\nWe can use them to enhance our military supply chain."
KRS_state_funeral_service_desc: "With war, there come casualties and...profits, of course. Why shouldn't we combine those two and offer affordable, yet dignified funerals for all the victims?"
KRS_convert_the_krosniewice_narrow_gauge_railway_desc: "The Krośniewice Narrow-Gauge Railway used to be a popular tourist attraction before The Fall. We should give it a new purpose. Transporting people and supplies in modern trains along these lines would be a great help to us. But first, we need to convert it to standard-gauge... which will cost us time and money."
KRS_use_the_speedway_bikes_desc: "The Skrzydlewski Family is a life-long sponsor of Speedway sports in Łódź. We should repurpose the motorcycles as lightweight, fast recon vehicles for our troops."
KRS_start_the_war_machine_desc: "It’s time. Our forces are stronger than ever and readier than ever. We will dominate Łódzkie!"
KRS_rutkowski_expertise_desc: "Rutkowski is our best bet when it comes to security. We shall use his experience in paramilitary training and his elite unit of detectives on the front lines to secure our victory!"
KRS_hidden_armories_desc: "As it turned out, Mr. Rutkowski possesses a few gun caches,which have been long hidden away from the public (and apparently from us) and he’s willing to donate his state-of-the-art weaponry to the war effort."
KRS_foreign_drill_instructors_desc: "Mr. Rutkowski is a very well-connected man. During one of many of the War Council’s sessions, he came up with the idea of hiring some of his old friends from abroad to train the Clique’s ever-growing army. We won’t skimp out on any funds in such an endeavor."
KRS_badges_into_rifles_desc: "Up until now Rutkowski’s Patrol has been equipped with standard equipment consisting of fatigues, a proper assault rifle, webbing and armor plates, complete with a rigorous, costly training course.\nHowever, its constant expansion has brought a certain motion to the forefront in the War Council. A wide allocation of funds into the broader military-industrial sector will surely let us give all of our soldiers fancier, better gear."
KRS_ebrantil_creativity_desc: "Despite many protests from many Clique officials, Ebrantil and his... inventions have proven themselves reliable and any rumors regarding his person were proven to be false by Skrzydlewski’s Fact Checkers. \nAs a matter of fact, Ebrantil during the meeting has presented his newest drug, which enhances our soldiers’ perceptiveness.\n\nLet’s make sure we utilize its potential to the fullest."
KRS_weaponised_pavulon_desc: "During the War Council session, Dr. Ebrantil has proposed the idea to use Pavulon, a muscle relaxing substance, as a combat agent sprayed across the battlefield much like the chemical gasses of old. \nThis brilliant, yet incredibly morbid idea will be implemented at once. Our Paramedics will strike fear into their hearts!"
KRS_memory_enhancing_pills_desc: "Apparently, in another fit of their genius, the Paramedics have created a drug which, supposedly, enhances the memory of its users.\nOur military officials are excited to see it in field use, citing better retention of training materials and experiences in the field."
KRS_fields_of_flesh_desc: "I-I..I don't even..."
KRS_fires_in_the_west_desc: "We were very patient. But one can take only so much furious slander. They wanted war for a long time with their constant provocations. Despite our business ties and our generosity, Sapkowski proved himself to be a paranoid lunatic, who sees enemies where we saw money and progress. We’ve ought to give him a few lessons in economics. Give the Patrol orders to move out."
KRS_secure_our_capital_interests_desc: "This is it. This is the moment the heads of the Clique were waiting for since its establishment. Time to finally remove the Beast of Dialogue from its throne! And of course, regain direct control over our many interests in the capital of the region."
KRS_finish_off_the_stragglers_desc: "The men of our Clique will march down South and wipe out any resistance with a series of well placed blows.\nScout Partisans, Coal Fanatics, Jewish Hooligans, it doesn’t matter. None can stand before our might! We need to mop up any remaining resistance. Send in the detectives."
KRS_business_is_business_desc: "It is done. With the Scouts banished into the forests, the Bełchatów Power Plant under our control, the Hooligans pacified, the Mad King put into an asylum, where he belongs and the Lord of Dialogue removed from his seat of power we are finally free to conduct business undisturbed. \n\nIt’s time for our profits to go sky high, open up the champagne, boys!"

 war_profit.1.desc: "War, such a big tragedy that befalls an entire nation, right? WRONG. War is in fact one of, if not, the most lucrative and guaranteed way of profit. While we may not be able to profit from selling guns or other military equipment, we sure do have a monopoly on funeral services and there is a lot to gain from that. What we need to do now, is to drag out this current conflict as much as we can, or switch between different wars, in a way that fighting will never stop. Such behavior with bless us with guaranteed influx of money, right into our pockets, while local cementeries will see highest activity in a last few decades."

 krosniewice.1.t: "Refugees from Abroad"
 krosniewice.1.desc: "Our country is surrounded by the strangest of regimes, and this makes Consortium definitely a sanctuary amidst a sea of madness. In the west there are Eurocommissariats and the pseudo-historical state of the Piasts and even wannabe Romans. In the north, theocracies and religious fanatics. In the east, worshippers of the mediocre book based on games and other fantastic beasts. To the south, there is a large crater in Bałuty, coal worshipers, half-wits from Widzew and bloodthirsty scouts. No wonder people choose stability and show up at our borders hoping not to be thrown into a river in a sleeping bag, burned at the stake or shot for disobedience. Plus, who can resist our 2-in-1 life insurance offer? Buy one for your family, you'll get extra coffin for a funeral!\n\nAlas, it ain't all fine and dandy. Border crossings are almost besieged, and Rutkowski demands more people to guard the checkpoints. And that's because, in addition to innocent refugees, saboteurs and extremists also can get through. Unless they pay us, or want to make some deal of course. Recently, we even undertook one such interesting business proposal from West Pomerania. It hurt our clients, but if they don't find out who helped them, we can earn even more from it!\n\nSo, refugees welcome!"

An increasing number of burglaries, robberies and attacks on both civilian, Patrol and Corporate infrastructure have been noticed in the recent weeks. A number of well-armed and organized gangs have already been identified as culprits of those crimes. Any involvement of foreign saboteurs or agents is yet to be confirmed.\n\nIf we want to bring this region back onto its feet then we need to act fast. Any sign of weakness could lead to some... unfavorable voices speaking up against our leadership."

 krosniewice.3.desc: "Knotweed! Knotweed! Cheap sale! Knootweeeeed! - shouted some old lady with Skrzydlewska emblem pinned to her chest. Around her stall on Krośniewice market, a lot of bystanders have gathered, who where looking at pots filled with pink flowers\n\n-What can you do with them? - asked some former pensioner, now homeworker. Nobody saw any pensions anymore, as Skrzydlewski did not bother with them at all.\n\nSaleswoman hesitated for a second - Script...script...- she repeatedly said in her mind until she finally remembered what she was supposed to say.\n-EAT. They're very tasty!\n\nEveryone looked at her very surprised. To cut any speculations, she quickly grabbed one of the flowers, plucked out the petals and with a swift move, she put them in her mouth. She was chewing very bravely and calmly to avoid any face grimaces which may have indicated something other than delight. After swallowing, she said:\n-Of course, they taste best cooked. With potatoes. Or groats. Only 5 zloty per piece! They cost 5 Euros per piece in France, and are considered delicacy. Appreciate that Skrzydlewska got them for you! Come and buy!\n\nAnd yes. Some of the people thought it was better to eat knotweed with potatoes, instead of only potatoes."

 krosniewice.4.t: "Way to Progress"
 krosniewice.4.desc: "- Gentlemen. - Mr. Skrzydlewski sat down in his chair. To his left, Detective Rutkowski shifted uncomfortably in his seat. To his right, Doctor Ebrantil sat completely motionless. His muffled breathing was the only thing filling the room.\nAn old grandfather clock located by the wall struck midnight. How an expensive antique of that kind ended up in an otherwise typical corporate meeting room was anyone’s guess, perhaps for the sheer contrast value of it.\n - Without reforms, there is no progress - He continued - And without progress, no good business can be made.\n\nThe CEO nonchalantly clapped his hands. Two assistants, carrying a whiteboard and big sheets of paper covered in different symbols and letters, emerged from the side door and quickly began to set it up.\n - If we dream of unifying the country and transforming it into a prosperous, rich republic ruled by us and like-minded individuals we need to act quickly, before any of the other so-called governments located in our country can make any real moves.\nHe paused for a second, letting the cold emphasis on the word governments leave an impact on his fellow listeners. Rutkowski let a quick nervous cough out, constantly swapping between looking at the CEO and the Doctor, who did not move at all during his little speech.\n\n - This is why I am overjoyed to see you here. Our expertise, our contacts and our resources combined will transform this little land into an undefeated coalition of prosperous business, lethal force and cutting-edge science. A force to be reckoned with.\nOne of the assistants slowly walked over to the table and began passing out fine cigars. A soft click of a Zippo lighter interrupted the silence. Skrzydlewski thanked the assistant, who quickly ran off, and let out a big puff of flavourful smoke.\n - With that, I would like to officially begin our meeting. Let us waste no more time. Areczek! - He made a gesture towards the other assistant - Please turn our presentation over to page one..."

 skrzydlewscy.1.desc: "- And that concludes our business, I believe - Skrzydlewski raised his hand for his interlocutor to shake.\n - Mr. Skrzydlewski, you must realise this shop - the man whimpered trying to defend his family legacy - means everything to me. It's a family business you see.\n - I understand the sentiment - Skrzydlewski interrupted him, backing his hand - Owning the largest florist shop in the whole Warta must have been a source of great pride. - he made a dramatic pause - But that was before the war. Your comperatively small business can no longer sustain itself due to the bandits raids and that is evident judging by the sorry state of your flowers.\n Warta florist was keeping his head down in shame.\n - If you truly want your family legacy to live on, you'd be wise to sign the contract, we'd already negotiated.\n After last, brief hesitation the florist yelded. Henceforth, after two long years Witold finally monopolised all of the business associated with flowers."

Her voice was full of worry as she noticed that he didn't eat a dinner prepared by housekeeper. It's fifth time this week./n - I have to, my dear - Krzysztof Rutkowski replied - An entire district was reduced to dust in an atomic blast and nobody knows where it came from. It's my job as a head of security to determine what happened. Recently my contacts in the Brotherhood...\n - Your contracts in the Brotherhood - she interrupted him - are a bunch of nutjobs, who'll soon dig out Einstein from the grave and accuse him of causing the Bałuty explosion - she was getting tired from repeating the same argument for the whole two years - If you really want to gain fame as the detective, who uncovered the Bałuty Mystery, then go with your team to the Zone and search there.\n- You know Hołownia wouldn't allow this to happen. He claims it would violate his sacred neutrality - he didn't like when she questioned his methods.\n - Then make him, convince him, shoot him - I don't care. - She said angrily - You don't eat, you skip nights regularly, I can't speak with you about anything other than that damn crater - then her tone softened - I just want my husband back..."

 rutkowski.2.desc: "Name: Zbigniew Szprota\nAge: 77\nPlace of residence: Szpitalna 17, Krośniewice\nVictim of: Disappearance\nDate of incident: 23.03.2027\nDetailed informaton: Mr. Szprota was last seen leaving his house by his neighbour, heading for his routine of sitting on a bench and conversing with his associate, Wojciech Mokrodolski. Most of the neighbours don't know what happened as they ignored the pair. Two men were known for their loud drunken ramblings and most of the inhabitants of the neighborhood simply ignore them, while they argue with each other. I also haven't been able to contact Mr. Mokrodolski as he died in the local hospital the same day. One testimony, he's heared says that their talk that happened at the day of disappearance was unusually short for them. The person, who gave the testimony said, she looked as to what happened out of curiosity and said that they watched as he was leaving with some surgical mask-wearing man (!) in a trench coat in the general direction of the local clinic. The same clinic Mokrodolski died. They could have been heading somewhere else and anyone can wear a face mask so it all may be a coincidence, but something tells me the local paramedics are up to something. Maybe Ebrantil is losing a grip on his underlings... Or he isn't."

 pogotowie.1.t: "Shadows of the Red Cross"
 pogotowie.1.desc: "Zbigniew and Wojciech sat on a small bench, reminiscing about Poland's communist days and how The Fall would have never happened under a socialist regime. They were quite known in their neighborhood thanks to their long, shouty rants about the 'good old days' that would sometimes last for hours on end and would often wake small babies up, causing the pair to be especially despised by mothers living in nearby flats. \n\n- I'm telling you, Zbysiu - these fools would come up to my window and throw rocks at it! Throw rocks at my window for voicing my support for The Party! Hah, so much for their 'freedom of speech! - Wojtek barked at his older colleague. \n - Exactly! And look... look where their inept liberalism got us! - replied Zbyszek, breathing heavily. His age was starting to take his oratory skills away from him, with his speech becoming slower and more painful with every month. - At least they didn't manage to... ...to take healthcare away from us... Damn bandits, they'd kill us all and sell our organs for a dime if they could... only to then sew us back again as some monstrous, enslaved horro- \n- Hello, Mr Zbigniew. - \n\nZbigniew's fiery speech was cut short by a face mask-donning doctor who imperceptibly sat next to him and started searching for medical appliances in his bag. After giving him a quick check-up and accidentally smearing him and his colleague with a small bit of an unknown ointment he had on one of his gloves, the doctor decided that he needs to take him for an hour to the local clinic to conduct a further examination. After a quick goodbye, Wojtek was left alone to himself... and his small flask of whiskey, which he always slowly sipped from when his pal was away. But as he emptied his flask, he noticed that something was wrong... His friend would always come back around the time he was halfway through his drink - he had managed to down the entire flask in one sitting before, and- HOLY SHIT it's been THREE HOURS since Zbyszek and his medic left, where the HELL are they? Hello? Is anyone here? Can anyone hear me? Hello? I cannot feel anything - can anyone hear me? Please?! I beg you?! PLEASE!? PLEASE!?- \n\nWojciech lied unconscious on a small bench, not responding to any words of passers-by who tried to help him. Thankfully, a paramedic who often came here to attend one of his patients arrived on the scene and gave him an injection that managed to wake him up. \n- Sir! Sir, are you there? Hello? Oh thank God you're back. It appears you've passed out from a strong allergic reaction to a cosmetic of sorts. Don't worry, however, we'll take you to the clinic and give you a quick examination and some meds to put you back on your feet, ok? \n- Umm... doctor?..."

 krs_meeting.1.t: "Question of War"#hujowo napisałem pozdrawiam
 krs_meeting.1.desc: "An immediate reform of the military is one of the first talking points of the meeting.\n\nRutkowski’s solution is simple, yet brilliant. It involves turning the Patrol into a formidable fighting force by introducing a large expansion programme. Its first point involved a big recruitment drive, preceded by a nation-wide campaign in all media outlets.\n\nMr. Skrzydlewski, however, has come up with a more direct and quicker solution. In his vision, a sparse amount of the Clique’s budget should be invested into hiring Private Military Contractors, who would protect the borders until the Patrol can be properly expanded at a later time.\n\nDoctor Ebrantil’s idea is the most divisive, yet the most intriguing of them all. He revealed that the Paramedic Laboratory is working on something called the 'J-22 Compound''. The details of its effects are not yet publicly known, which makes Rutkowski a little skeptical, but Ebrantil seems fully convinced of its incredible potential as a chemical warfare agent.\n\nThe resources allocated to this particular issue are limited, what is our choice?"

 krs_meeting.2.t: "Question of Refugees"
 krs_meeting.2.desc: "The ongoing refugee crisis is another important issue debated during the meeting.\n\nMr. Skrzydlewski is fully convinced to jump at the opportunity and press as many refugees into our workforce as humanly possible. His PR team’s idea involves a full-blown advertisement campaign by the border that includes billboards, loudspeakers, benefits for the fresh-employed and a plenty of good, old fashioned corporate astroturfing inside the makeshift refugee camps.\n\nHowever, Detective Rutkowski finds the idea outrageous, pointing at glaring security issues that would arise by letting a gigantic wave of people settle inside our borders. In his strongly-voiced opinion, the increase of criminal activities and possibility of foreign infiltration is not worth the risk. Instead, he proposes to lock the border down with police equipped with riot equipment, to curb any disorder among the refugees.\n\nEbrantil, being himself, decides that „he would take care of the issue in a beneficial way”. No concrete explanation to that statement has been given, but backroom talks during the discussions have rumored about a need for „volunteers'', who would help the Paramedics in future experiments.\n\nWe cannot let this crisis deepen, what is our choice?"

 krs_meeting.3.t: "Question of Training"
 krs_meeting.3.desc: "If we want to protect our interests, we need an army, and one of the first steps to achieve that is to establish a standard training programme for its soldiers.\nMr. Skrzydlewski is especially passionate about this issue. In his mind, the Patrol should become a highly specialized formation of corporate security that would primarily focus on protecting already established assets, and adjusting the programme accordingly is the best choice.\n\nRutkowski’s vision is a little different, as it involves leaving the Patrol’s training programme as is, with a focus on investigative work, irregular tactics and V.I.P security, as well as protection of certain Point-Of-Interests. Keeping it small, but professional should be sufficient, seeing how our army is still one of the best-equipped in the region.\n\nEbrantil’s idea, as always, proves to be the most controversial. Seeing how other warlords of the region seem to enlarge their forces at an alarming pace, the Clique should do the same, which is why the training programme should be as simple and idiot-proof as possible. That, however, will turn our army into a large, yet unprofessional militia, while cementing the Patrol’s role as the elite, special force to be used when the state’s interest demands.\n\nOur soldiers need to receive training, what is our choice?"

 krs_meeting.4.t: "Question of Dissidents"
 krs_meeting.4.desc: "It’s completely clear that the bandit problem did not arise overnight. Looking at the extent of it, it is safe to say that a myriad of different things contributed to its appearance.\nThe heads of the Triumvirate, however, cannot agree on which one of them is the defining one and should be tackled first.\n\nMr. Skrzydlewski argues that the corrupted civil administration, a relic of the old Polish state, is responsible for this state of affairs. In turn, his proposition consists of weeding out the troublemakers by helping the public in “electing” a new mayor of Krośniewice, who is our de facto leader, when it comes to administrating our civilian population. His proposed candidate is supposed to be incorruptible, and he promised to spare no expense in helping her to reach power.\n\nDetective Rutkowski believes the cause to be much more straightforward - a conspiracy, stretching far and wide across our country. The bandits could be anywhere. Even your neighbor can be one, that’s right! This is why he proposes to establish a network of Patrol informants in all echelons of our society. In turn, it would allow the Patrol to gather more intelligence on potential criminals and spies, and thus be able to prevent any hostile acts in a more efficient manner.\n\nEbrantil is much more… straightforward in his ideas. In his eyes, it’s an issue of an alarming number of dissidents that allow banditry to grow and drain the Clique of precious resources. And those dissidents must be removed in a beneficial way.The details of his proposed solution are quite murky, but it involves camps. And a cooperation with a local meat packing plant. \n\nSo, which of those proposed ideas shall we settle on?"
 krs_meeting.4.a: "\"Elect\" a new mayor"
 krs_meeting.4.b: "Establish a network of Patrol informants"
 krs_meeting.4.c: "Grind up all of them"
 
 krs_meeting.5.t: "Question of Civil Servants"
 krs_meeting.5.desc: "During one of many sessions of the meeting, the Triumvirate came to the conclusion that no attempt to fix the crime problem will be long-lasting, if our civil service is inadequate.\nA proposition to educate our civil servants in a way beneficial to both our government and the people has been approved. The thing is, what exactly should we educate them on?\n\nMr. Skrzydlewski believes that it’s best to reorganize our civil service akin to a company. This is why he thinks that the main line of education should focus on making our civil servants into low-level business managers, who, by using their position, can protect the interests of the Consortium, and by that, the interests of the whole Triumvirate.\n\nDetective Rutkowski believes this to be the perfect occasion to improve our defensive capabilities. He proposes to teach our civil servants basics of self-defense, small-scale unit tactics and skills necessary to conduct an investigation. In his vision, this would help in case of a sudden low-level insurgency in the country and provide a number of ready recruits for the Patrol.\n\nIn a shocking display of compassion, Doctor Ebrantil believes that teaching our civil servants basic medicine will improve the access to healthcare in our more remote areas, and by that, will improve the standards of living, which will result in a decrease of crime.\n\nHowever, we cannot overburden our civil servants with too many duties, what will be our choice?"

 krs_meeting.6.t: "Question of the Bandits"
 krs_meeting.6.desc: "Our current anti-crime efforts have been paying off. Over the last couple of months, the amount of robberies and assaults have decreased due to our hard work. And yet, we still need to eliminate the biggest gangs that plague our society. They have been untouchable since The Fall, but now it is our time to finally finish them off, and end the anarchy. The question is, what should we exactly do with them? These are hardened, experienced killers. Mr. Skrzydlewski argues that their services could be beneficial for the state, and thinks that hiring them to be an official part of the Consortium is the best course of action. Naturally, this opinion doesn’t sit well with Detective Rutkowski. They might be useful, but in the end, they are still bandits that cannot be trusted. But, they can still prove useful, as workers in a chain of labor camps that the Patrol would like to operate. If there’s a sure way for them to repay the state for their misdeeds, it’s this one. And, of course, there’s also Doctor Ebrantil. He also believes that the bandits have some use in the form of enlisting them into the military after a series of… modifications. His presentation on the subject involves a demonstration of- OH DEAR LORD IN HEAVENS, WHAT IS THAT!?\n\nThe crime question needs an immediate solution. What is our choice?"

 krs_meeting.7.t: "Question of the Economy"
 krs_meeting.7.desc: "The Top Brass of the Clique has a lot of plans. Bold plans that could flip the power balance of the region on its head. The image of corporate skyscrapers towering over Krośniewice strokes the wildest fires of imagination. We can change this country for the better, remove all business restrictions that plagued it Pre-Fall, and get filthy rich in the process. For that to happen, however, we need to drag our economy out of the gutter. The situation in our many business partners’ borders is rapidly deteriorating, and so are our profits. Many projects with huge potential had to be sidelined, or canceled altogether. However, there’s one opportunity to divert a significant portion of our assets towards a megaproject that could potentially turn the tide of our dying economy and bring it back to the top. But, the heads of the Triumvirate can’t really agree on which project should be chosen.\n\nThe Consortium proposes to use big, empty and fertile areas of our country and convert them into tulip farms. With just enough time, money and manpower, our tulips will surpass those harvested in the Netherlands, and, in turn, will allow us a steady supply flow towards our flower shops, and a steady flow of profits. Rutkowski doesn’t really agree with that idea. Instead, he thinks that the best choice of action is renting out a few of our many Patrol units to different warlords all around Poland. He argues that it’s both a good way to train our troopers for an upcoming conflict, and a way to acquire funds for our economy. Ebrantil’s idea, as always, seems very risky, but could be very profitable in the long run. He wants to use our sparse funds to build an enormous research facility that would double as an ultra-effective chemical plant. In passing, he mentioned something about “more meat”, leaving everyone to wonder what that entails.\n\nWe need to allocate our funds smartly, what should we focus on?"

 krs_meeting.8.desc: "During one of the meetings, Detective Rutkowski has pointed out an important asset that could be used for our purposes. The powerful heads of the Triumvirate have a lot of friends, and not all of them live in territories controlled by us. To save our economy and country, we need to reach out abroad, and utilize those connections. Not all of them can, or will, help us. We need to pinpoint a few key areas that could use their support and focus on one that will receive the most of their generosity. Skrzydlewski’s Family still has a lot of assets left all around what used to be Poland. Boarded up funeral homes, burnt out flower shops and empty logistics centers might not be too much, but with just enough assistance, they can be turned back into a prosperous empire that provides funerals all across the country. On the other hand, the Detective could catch up with some old friends of his, back from his days in Austria. A little visit and a few gifts should be enough for them to lend us their expertise. And guns. Doctor Ebrantil, shocking everyone with a surprising amount of compassion, proposes to use his… acquaintances from the East to provide our market with lots of cheap, affordable medicine substitutes that would allow our citizens better quality healthcare, or so he says at least.\n\nAfter a long series of debates and arguments, the heads decided on..."

 krs_meeting.9.t: "Question of Resources"
 krs_meeting.9.desc: "To put it simply, none of our plans can succeed in the long run without a sizable amount of natural resources. Unfortunately, the area we control is not exactly the richest one when it comes to such lifeblood, which is why we need desperate measures to obtain it. Plenty of small businesses exist in the town of Krośniewice and the surrounding area. Junkyards, factories, shops, warehouses. All full of useful materials that could be used for the needs of the Clique. Of course, they won’t be too happy to share those without compensation. Sadly, our current budget does not allow us to provide those. Thankfully, Mr. Skrzydlewski came up with a slightly different idea. What if we just take them without paying? Detective Rutkowski seems outraged by this, though. Instead, he thinks that the best way is to send our most overzealous, most formal inspectors to the streets so that they may plunder each and every piece of evidence of any crime that they can find, and then find a suitable use for them. There is one proposal that doesn’t involve strong-arming competitors or looting each and every item from law-bending citizens. Dr. Ebrantil has come up with a project. He’s unwilling to share any concrete details, mentioning only something about a certain starch extracted from “spent material”, whatever that means.\n\nOur current capabilities allow us to choose one of those options, which one shall it be?"

To commemorate this beautiful event, the Triumvirate has come up with the idea of constructing a megaproject. Something that will not only improve our capabilities, but also show all warlords of Poland the might of the Krośniewice Clique. The Consortium argues for a project that would emphasize the power of our newly-forged economy. The Grand Greenhouse is a perfect way to ensure a steady supply of flowers to our shops and food to our citizens' tables. The Patrol argues for something that would show our military might to the world. A well fortified Headquarters, equipped with a series of fortifications, anti-air defenses, a prison complex and a surveillance center among others is a sure way to show every single saboteur and traitor that Detective Rutkowski doesn’t play around when it comes to matters of national security. And finally, top researchers of The Paramedics want to ensure that our nation will never fall from the position of being a technological leader by establishing the Krośniewice Institute of Medical Sciences. Despite raising some eyebrows, Doctor Ebrantil ensures that nothing, §Rnothing§! besides the usual procedures is going to happen inside the building.\n\nOur recovery needs a tangible symbol, what should we choose?"

We have, however, also received reports that the Medical Service is, in fact, the Consortium's shadow hand that serves as it's espionage wing and secret police, deals with it's wetwork and connects the clique to the Black Market as well. The population of Łódź seems oblivious to this fact, however, thanks to the Triumvirate's control over the information that reaches it's people."

unification.36.t: "[GetNewspaper]Rutkowski Patrol unifies Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.36.desc: "For a long time, Łódź remained one of the few regions not engulfed in constant war, with the local cliques instead taking to the bargaining table to investigate the mysterious nuclear explosion in Bałuty. It seems like cooperation turned out for the better for Łodzian power players, as the region has just got united by a union of three factions working in symbiosis with each other. \n\nThe so-called "Flower Consortium" is a triumvirate of H. Skrzydlewska, the Łódź Emergency Medical Service, and Krzysztof Rutkowski - ex-private detective, now the Consortium's muscle. With Skrzydlewski handling the money and the Emergency Service providing black market arms and info, Rutkowski utilizes his patrol team to keep any dissent in check and to secure further assets for the Triumvirate, whose neighbours start to fear they might soon receive a knock from a certain guy with a pair of shades and a square, Duke Nukem-esque haircut."
unification.36.a: "The Triumvirate stays strapped."

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_WITOLD_SKRZYDLEWSKI_DESC: "The head of a family of famous, and most importantly, rich florists. Despite his initial lack of interest in family business and his passion for cars, he eventually upheld the family tradition and took over the company after his mother retired. Known for his daring nature, he soon expanded the offer of H.Skrzydlewska to also include funeral services. This sparked many controversies, including supposed involvement in the „Skin Hunters'' affair. In 2001 he was the target of an failed assassination plot, probably orchestrated by his competition enraged by his aggresive business practices. In the years preceding the Fall he greatly benefited from increasing mortality, earning so much that he was able to gain control over a part of Łódź Voivodeship and fund a small state, which withstood the collapse of Poland."
POLITICS_KRZYSZTOF_RUTKOWSKI_DESC: "The former politician that claims to be the most renowned Polish private detective is back in the saddle once more. He began his career specializing in finding and returning stolen vehicles and works of art, he later moved on to rescuing kidnapees. Rutkowski's actions often caused strong diplomatic protests because he used his diplomatic passport to enter other countries, which he would not have been allowed to enter with a regular passport. Those events were also presented in the aforementioned TV series. After the Fall he was hired by Witold Skrzydlewski as a permanent police force for his newly created state and has recently undertaken an investigation regarding the Bałuty nuclear explosion."
POLITICS_EBRANTIL_DESC: "After years of hiding and meticulous planning, Dr. Ebrantil, former leader of infamous Skin Hunters, can finally reveal himself. Years of prison and post-Fall hardships turned this already immoral murderer into a true mad scientist. Now that he assumed direct control over the Consortium nothing will stop him in his goal of spreading his pseudo-medical horror."
