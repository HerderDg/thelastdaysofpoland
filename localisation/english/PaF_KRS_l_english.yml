KRS_up_in_the_town_of_krosniewice_desc: "Up in the town of Krośniewice, a group of three parties meet, \nThe Businessman, The Detective and The Paramedic elite,\nThey shake hands, a fair deal they quickly settle,\nTo the Triumvirate, they freely submit their mettle."

KRS_the_new_agenda_desc: ""

KRS_lock_the_doors_desc: "If we are to meet, we’ll need utmost security and who’s better to do that than Rutkowski’s men. His agents will be just the people needed to keep everyone out and keep whatever happens in. We must ensure that our dealings are kept as professional as could be. Hey, we might impress the parties involved if we try hard enough."
KRS_and_begin_the_meeting_desc: "Let our meeting begin! There are alot of things to discuss and a lot of problems to tackle on our first official gathering. Disappearances, Bandits and even just Refugees from worse parts of Poland, or those seeking to travel to the Eurocomissariats are just three of our pressing issues. And for better or for worse, everyone has their own ideas for solving these problems, which makes it abundantly clear that keeping this Triumvirate in balance will be harder than we had previously thought."
KRS_fixin_our_problems_desc: "Crime, the scourge that affects not only our populace, but also reflects poorly on us. This wave of lawlessness spurred by the Fall must be stopped and prevented from happening again. Getting rid of petty criminals is the first step in eliminating these crippling issues from our state. We’ll see what solutions are put forward..."
KRS_educating_civil_servants_desc: "Now, let us talk about preventative measures. We need a more effective system of law enforcement and we need it now. Sure we can buy them all sorts of fancy gear, but what worth is it if they don’t know how to effectively use it? That’s why we’ll need to give them a proper education, not whatever bottom of the barrel course they had to pass to get their cozy job."
KRS_destroying_crime_desc: "The final piece of the puzzle for which we are now adequately prepared for is the goal of completely destroying any bandit activity in our region. Our well educated and well armed law enforcement will have no pity as it pacifies our lands, cracking down on any armed dissenters. The people will surely thank us for finally putting an end to this menace."

Skrzydlewska - a funeral service and florist company which now holds a monopoly on the state's politics and economy, controlling most of the businesses and civil services in their lands.

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_WITOLD_SKRZYDLEWSKI_DESC:0 "The head of a family of famous, and most importantly, rich florists. Despite his initial lack of interest in family business and his passion for cars, he eventually upheld the family tradition and took over the company after his mother retired. Known for his daring nature, he soon expanded the offer of H.Skrzydlewska to also include funeral services. This sparked many controversies, including supposed involvement in the „Skin Hunters'' affair. In 2001 he was the target of an failed assassination plot, probably orchestrated by his competition enraged by his aggresive business practices. In the years preceding the Fall he greatly benefited from increasing mortality, earning so much that he was able to gain control over a part of Łódź Voivodeship and fund a small state, which withstood the collapse of Poland."
POLITICS_KRZYSZTOF_RUTKOWSKI_DESC:0 "The former politician that claims to be the most renowned Polish private detective is back in the saddle once more. He began his career specializing in finding and returning stolen vehicles and works of art, he later moved on to rescuing kidnapees. Rutkowski's actions often caused strong diplomatic protests because he used his diplomatic passport to enter other countries, which he would not have been allowed to enter with a regular passport. Those events were also presented in the aforementioned TV series. After the Fall he was hired by Witold Skrzydlewski as a permanent police force for his newly created state and has recently undertaken an investigation regarding the Bałuty nuclear explosion."
POLITICS_EBRANTIL_DESC:0 "After years of hiding and meticulous planning, Dr. Ebrantil, former leader of infamous Skin Hunters, can finally reveal himself. Years of prison and post-Fall hardships turned this already immoral murderer into a true mad scientist. Now that he assumed direct control over the Consortium nothing will stop him in his goal of spreading his pseudo-medical horror."
