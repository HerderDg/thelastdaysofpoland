POLITICS_WITOLD_SKRZYDLEWSKI_DESC:0 "Witold Skrzydlewski (born September 5, 1952) – Businessman, speedway enthusiast and the head of the Skrzydlewski family, Witold Skrzydlewski was born in Łódź in 1952 in a family of famous florists. Despite his initial lack of interest in family business and his passion for cars, he eventually upheld family tradition and took over the company his mother retired from in the 1980s. Known for his daring nature, he soon expanded the offer of H.Skrzydlewska to also include funeral services. This sparked many controversies, including supposed involvement in the „Skin Hunters” affair. In 2001 he was a target of an failed assassination plot, probably orchestrated by his competition enraged by his aggresive business practices. In the years preceding the Fall he greatly benefited from increasing mortality, earning so much that he was able to gain control over a part of Łódź Voivodeship and fund a small state, which withstood the collapse of Poland."

Rutkowski himself claims to be the most renowned Polish private detective. He began his career specializing in finding and returning stolen vehicles and works of art. Later in his career, Rutkowski rescued many kidnapped people. Rutkowski's actions often caused strong diplomatic protests because he used his diplomatic passport to enter other countries, which he would not have been allowed to enter with a regular passport. Those events were also presented in the aforementioned TV series. After the Fall he was hired by Witold Skrzydlewski as a permament police force for his newly created state and has recently undertook an investigation regarding the Bałuty nuclear explosion."
