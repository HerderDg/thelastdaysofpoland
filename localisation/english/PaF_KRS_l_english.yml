The precious luxury that we unfortunately cannot afford even with all the money in the world. Not really surprising barring that, our government is composed mainly of three groups, which aren’t all especially reputable . While our only achievement so far is implementing barely "some" semblance of order and stability."

What we need to do now is to drag out this conflict as much as we can, so while cemeteries will fill up with new graves our pockets will fill up with new shiny coins."

It seems like cooperation turned out for the better for Łodzian power players, as the region has just got united by a union of three factions working in symbiosis with each other. \n\nThe so-called "Flower Consortium" is a triumvirate of Krzysztof Rutkowski, the Łódź Emergency Medical Service, and Witold Skrzydlewski - Consortium's main power broker, spokesman and the head of H. Skrzydlewska - a funeral service and florist company which now holds a monopoly on the state's politics and economy, controlling most of the businesses and civil services in their lands. The Triumvirate's neighbours worry whether they'll be able to stop it's growth, or will their statelets only serve as fertile ground for the Consortium to further blossom upon."

We have, however, also received reports that the Medical Service is, in fact, the Consortium's shadow hand that serves as it's espionage wing and secret police, deals with it's wetwork and connects the clique to the Black Market as well. The population of Łódź seems oblivious to this fact, however, thanks to the Triumvirate's control over the information that reaches it's people."

With Skrzydlewski handling the money and the Emergency Service providing black market arms and info, Rutkowski utilizes his patrol team to keep any dissent in check and to secure further assets for the Triumvirate, whose neighbours start to fear they might soon receive a knock from a certain guy with a pair of shades and a square, Duke Nukem-esque haircut."

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_WITOLD_SKRZYDLEWSKI_DESC:0 "The head of a family of famous, and most importantly, rich florists. Despite his initial lack of interest in family business and his passion for cars, he eventually upheld the family tradition and took over the company after his mother retired. Known for his daring nature, he soon expanded the offer of H.Skrzydlewska to also include funeral services. This sparked many controversies, including supposed involvement in the „Skin Hunters'' affair. In 2001 he was the target of an failed assassination plot, probably orchestrated by his competition enraged by his aggresive business practices. In the years preceding the Fall he greatly benefited from increasing mortality, earning so much that he was able to gain control over a part of Łódź Voivodeship and fund a small state, which withstood the collapse of Poland."
POLITICS_KRZYSZTOF_RUTKOWSKI_DESC:0 "The former politician that claims to be the most renowned Polish private detective is back in the saddle once more. He began his career specializing in finding and returning stolen vehicles and works of art, he later moved on to rescuing kidnapees. Rutkowski's actions often caused strong diplomatic protests because he used his diplomatic passport to enter other countries, which he would not have been allowed to enter with a regular passport. Those events were also presented in the aforementioned TV series. After the Fall he was hired by Witold Skrzydlewski as a permanent police force for his newly created state and has recently undertaken an investigation regarding the Bałuty nuclear explosion."
POLITICS_EBRANTIL_DESC:0 "After years of hiding and meticulous planning, Dr. Ebrantil, former leader of infamous Skin Hunters, can finally reveal himself. Years of prison and post-Fall hardships turned this already immoral murderer into a true mad scientist. Now that he assumed direct control over the Consortium nothing will stop him in his goal of spreading his pseudo-medical horror."
