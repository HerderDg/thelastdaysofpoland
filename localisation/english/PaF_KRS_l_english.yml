KRS_up_in_the_town_of_krosniewice_desc: "Up in the town of Krośniewice, a group of three parties meet, \nThe Businessman, The Detective and The Paramedic elite,\nThey shake hands, a fair deal they quickly settle,\nTo the Triumvirate, they freely submit their mettle."
KRS_the_new_agenda_desc: "Our state is plagued with countless problems and all of us know that well, so that’s why a meeting is in order. All three parties in one place to discuss all that ails us and what’s the ointment to aid us. Each and every matter of state, every problem. We will do our best."
KRS_lock_the_doors_desc: "If we are to meet, we’ll need utmost security and who’s better to do that than Rutkowski’s men. His agents will be just the people needed to keep everyone out and keep whatever happens in. We must ensure that our dealings are kept as professional as could be. Hey, we might impress the parties involved if we try hard enough."
KRS_and_begin_the_meeting_desc: "Let our meeting begin! There are alot of things to discuss and a lot of problems to tackle on our first official gathering. Disappearances, Bandits and even just Refugees from worse parts of Poland, or those seeking to travel to the Eurocomissariats are just three of our pressing issues. And for better or for worse, everyone has their own ideas for solving these problems, which makes it abundantly clear that keeping this Triumvirate in balance will be harder than we had previously thought."
KRS_fixin_our_problems_desc: "Crime, the scourge that affects not only our populace, but also reflects poorly on us. This wave of lawlessness spurred by the Fall must be stopped and prevented from happening again. Getting rid of petty criminals is the first step in eliminating these crippling issues from our state. We’ll see what solutions are put forward..."
KRS_educating_civil_servants_desc: "Now, let us talk about preventative measures. We need a more effective system of law enforcement and we need it now. Sure we can buy them all sorts of fancy gear, but what worth is it if they don’t know how to effectively use it? That’s why we’ll need to give them a proper education, not whatever bottom of the barrel course they had to pass to get their cozy job."
KRS_destroying_crime_desc: "The final piece of the puzzle for which we are now adequately prepared for is the goal of completely destroying any bandit activity in our region. Our well educated and well armed law enforcement will have no pity as it pacifies our lands, cracking down on any armed dissenters. The people will surely thank us for finally putting an end to this menace."
KRS_invest_in_a_megaproject_desc: "Every great nation has its grand monuments; amazing works of humankind’s labor and to show that we are a prestigious state, even more so that the ones around us, we shall create a Megaproject of our own. It surely won’t be an easy feat, however when we finish it, everyone will see that we are a beacon of progress and that our cause is one worth supporting."
KRS_conclude_the_meeting_desc: "Now that everything’s over and done with, we can finish our meeting. Licking our admittedly grievous wounds was just the first step however. We can now properly move onto cementing our position in the Voivodeship.\nLet’s hope that the future is not too unkind to us."
KRS_expand_the_patrol_desc: "Rutkowski’s Patrol has so far been an integral part of our state’s law enforcement, serving as detectives leagues better than whatever remains of the Police remain. Due to their skill a proposal has been put forward by Rutkowski, suggesting we allow for the creation of a new branch of his organization. The new branch would focus on leading proper military training for our soldier boys to improve upon our currently very ad-hoc method of training troops."
KRS_prepare_the_airfields_desc: "If war will come to Łódzkie Voivodeship, then we cannot be caught unprepared in the wake of whatever conflict is to come. Our state is littered with all sorts of small airfields which could be repurposed for military use. Fielding more aircraft would be invaluable, as aerial support will greatly bolster our military might, without needing many more men. And besides, it’s not like anyone was actually using those airfields in the first place."
KRS_old_police_weapons_desc: "The Police left behind some pretty nifty toys for our boys to have fun with, so why not make use of them? They might not be top of the line machine guns, but they are high quality firearms regardless. Issue is, almost all of them haven’t been maintained for a very long time now and have fallen into disrepair. We will organize new weapon workshops to fix all of them right up. As a bonus we can later use the same workshops to create brand new guns."
KRS_no_time_to_lose_desc: "Tick, Tock, Tick, Tock...Time is money and we’ve spent all that we can afford. After all of our discussions and all of our preparations we hope we have done enough. We can’t delay any longer. It is time to assert our position as the true rulers of the Voivodeship.\nThe Triumvirate will triumph above everyone else."
KRS_guardin_our_interests_desc: "We need an army, there are no doubts about it. The country has spiraled so far out of control, it is basically impossible to get anything done without a swarm of armed men around you. A standing force should be one of our priorities if we want to assert ourselves as a serious component for the mantle of Łódzkie’s leader."
KRS_controlling_the_border_desc: "Our close proximity to the Eurocomissariats may be considered a boon for some, however it has brought upon more issues than we expected. Waves of refugees from the east constantly travel through our land, slowing down our implementation of law and destabilizing our nation further. There’s something that needs to be done about this issue of ours."
KRS_standard_training_programmes_desc: "Now that the more serious matters are out of the way, we can think about protecting ourselves and not just our whole state as a whole. A private security force for our top leaders needs to be organized, so that they don’t end up as victims of some crazed assassin, or one of the mysterious kidnappers plaguing our lands."
KRS_uppin_our_revenue_desc: "Money, we need it and we need a lot of it. Any state does, how can we buy just about anything from basic resources for our people to advanced tanks for our forces without a steady source of income? That’s why we need to decide on what industries to build up or expand to get this cash."
KRS_contracts_from_abroad_desc: "All of our three groups (surprisingly) agree on one thing - that we are businessmen and running a business on just the local level is really not profitable. Coming to a consensus was not hard, we must expand our ventures to the lands of other warlords. We’ll reach out a seemingly helpful hand, to goad them into coughing up cash for our oh so important services."
KRS_aquiring_resources_desc: "As part of our economic expansion, and the sheer fact the land we carved out for ourselves is not very bountiful has led us to needing more raw materials than we had accounted for. This unexpected problem needs to be solved post haste, unless we wish to risk an economic slowdown."
KRS_battle_for_lodzkie_desc: "Despite Hołownia’s efforts, war in Łódzkie is practically inevitable. We must prepare ourselves to defend our state from anyone wanting to claim it for themselves. We shall create a system of defenses on our borders, everyone who dares test us, will crash and burn trying to break through our lines."
KRS_divert_our_assets_desc: "Currently a lot of our factories are sitting around producing useless junk, instead of making things that will actually benefit us in any meaningful way. Who needs their third microwave, when we could be making rifles for our men instead? Refitting factories that are currently just a drain on our workforce into producing war supplies will put us one step ahead of everyone else in terms of producing weapons."
KRS_patch_the_holes_in_our_logistics_desc: "Supplies do not just magically appear in our soldier’s hands, so we need to fix that with the wonderful world of supply logistics. The issue however is, that we lack the means to transport our gear to the front. To remedy this issue, we’ll produce more transport vehicles. Soon brand new trucks and trains will be transporting our military goods all around our territories."
KRS_establish_a_supply_line_desc: "Well supplied armies are a real force to be reckoned with, so to further bolster our logistics capabilities, we will establish an organized system of supply lines to our fronts. Our soldiers will be able to fight for longer and won’t have to fear running out of bullets in the middle of nowhere, tens of kilometers away from the nearest supply hub."
KRS_establish_an_auxiliary_corps_desc: "A good way to encourage our people to aid in our effort is to create a well paid auxiliary corps. Even some unemployed nobody who simply grabs a shovel and helps us dig anti-tank ditches will be a great help, without needing much in the way of training or advanced skills. When push comes to shove, some of them might even decide to help bolster our army by joining its ranks when their work as auxiliaries ends."
KRS_comfort_families_desc: "Every day since the Fall, people have been dying en masse because of all the chaos that sweeps across the bloody remains of Poland. This has been a huge drain on the morale of our population, to say the least. In order to try and lessen the impact of these turbulent times, we will put on a smile and reimburse our population for the loss of loved ones and any grievous injuries. To curry favors with them of course."

They we're quite known in their neighbourhood thanks to their long, shouty rants about the 'good old days' that whould sometimes last for entire hours and whould often wake small babies up, causing the pair to be especially despised by mothers living in nearby flats. \n\n''I'm telling you, Zbysiu - these fools would come up to my window and throw rocks at it! Throw rocks at my window for voicing my support of The Party! Hah, so much for their 'freedom of speech'!'' - Wojtek barked to his older colleague. \n''Exactly! And look... look where their inept liberalism got us!'' - replied heavily breathing Zbyszek. His age was starting to take his oratory skills away from him, with his speech becoming slower and more painful with every month. - ''At least they didn't manage to... ...to take healthcare away from us... Damn bandits, they'd kill us all and sell our organs for a dime if they could... only to then sew us back again as some monstrous, enslaved horro-'' \n''Hello, Mr Zbigniew.'' \n\nZbigniew's fiery speech was cut short by a face mask-donning doctor who imperceptibly sat next to him and started searching for medical appliances in his bag. After giving him a quick check-up and accidentally smearing him and his colleague with a small bit of an unknown ointment he had on one of his gloves, the doctor decided that he needs to take him for an hour to the local clinic to conduct a further examination. After a quick goodbye, Wojtek was left alone to himself... and his small flask of whiskey, which he always slowly sipped from when his pal was away. But as he emptied his flask, he noticed that something was wrong... His friend whould always come back around the time he was halfway through his drink - he NEVER managed to down the entire flask in one sitting before, and- *HOLY SHIT* it's been *THREE HOURS* since Zbyszek and his medic left, where the HELL are they? Hello? Is anyone here? Can anyone hear me? Hello? I cannot feel anything - can anyone hear me? Please?! I beg you?! PLEASE!? *PLEASE!?-* \n\nWojciech lied unconscious on a small bench, not responding to any words of passers-by who tried to help him. Thankfully, a paramedic who often came here to attend one of his patients arrived on the scene and gave him an injection that managed to wake him up. \n''Sir! Sir, are you there? Hello? Oh thank God you're back. It appears you've passed out from a strong allergic reaction to a cosmetic of sorts. Don't worry, however - we'll take you to the clinic and give you a quick examination and some meds to put you back on your feet, ok?'' \n''Umm... doctor?..."

unification.36.desc:0 "For a long time, Łódź remained one of the few regions not engulfed in constant war, with the local cliques instead taking to the bargaining table to investigate the mysterious nuclear explosion in Bałuty. It seems like cooperation turned out for the better for Łodzian power players, as the region has just got united by a union of three factions working in symbiosis with each other. \n\nThe so-called "Flower Consortium" is a triumvirate of H. Skrzydlewska, the Łódź Emergency Medical Service, and Krzysztof Rutkowski - ex-private detective, now the Consortium's muscle. With Skrzydlewski handling the money and the Emergency Service providing black market arms and info, Rutkowski utilizes his patrol team to keep any dissent in check and to secure further assets for the Triumvirate, whose neighbours start to fear they might soon receive a knock from a certain guy with a pair of shades and a square, Duke Nukem-esque haircut."

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_WITOLD_SKRZYDLEWSKI_DESC:0 "The head of a family of famous, and most importantly, rich florists. Despite his initial lack of interest in family business and his passion for cars, he eventually upheld the family tradition and took over the company after his mother retired. Known for his daring nature, he soon expanded the offer of H.Skrzydlewska to also include funeral services. This sparked many controversies, including supposed involvement in the „Skin Hunters'' affair. In 2001 he was the target of an failed assassination plot, probably orchestrated by his competition enraged by his aggresive business practices. In the years preceding the Fall he greatly benefited from increasing mortality, earning so much that he was able to gain control over a part of Łódź Voivodeship and fund a small state, which withstood the collapse of Poland."
POLITICS_KRZYSZTOF_RUTKOWSKI_DESC:0 "The former politician that claims to be the most renowned Polish private detective is back in the saddle once more. He began his career specializing in finding and returning stolen vehicles and works of art, he later moved on to rescuing kidnapees. Rutkowski's actions often caused strong diplomatic protests because he used his diplomatic passport to enter other countries, which he would not have been allowed to enter with a regular passport. Those events were also presented in the aforementioned TV series. After the Fall he was hired by Witold Skrzydlewski as a permanent police force for his newly created state and has recently undertaken an investigation regarding the Bałuty nuclear explosion."
POLITICS_EBRANTIL_DESC:0 "After years of hiding and meticulous planning, Dr. Ebrantil, former leader of infamous Skin Hunters, can finally reveal himself. Years of prison and post-Fall hardships turned this already immoral murderer into a true mad scientist. Now that he assumed direct control over the Consortium nothing will stop him in his goal of spreading his pseudo-medical horror."
