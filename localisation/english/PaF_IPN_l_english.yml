unification.158.t: "[GetNewspaper]IPN unifies the Capital District!"
unification.158.desc: "It has long been proven that those who preserve history hold the inexorable power to bend its course to align with their purposes. Grasping this truism holds the key to understanding what continues to baffle the residents of the Capital District - how an institute whose official mission doesn't extend far beyond simple record-keeping could muster any significant fighting force, much less extend its influence over all of Warsaw. The drum-beating heart of past national glory inspired a newfound fervor in the population, and the collective memory of the heroes who once gave their lives for Polish freedom provided the rallying cry to again pull the country back from the brink of destruction. Thus, on the rubble of the capital, like a resurgent phoenix, stands a faction dedicated to national rejuvenation, to writing a new chapter in Poland's familiar story of survival against all hardships. Once more, it will attempt to rise from the ashes."
unification.158.a: "Just another day for the nation of martyrs."
