unificationreg.733.t: "[GetNewspaper]Rise of the Greater Slavic State of Vistula"
unificationreg.733.desc: "A new order seems to have emerged in the north of Poland, as the young Polish(?) government has surfaced because internal issues forced the West Pomeranian “Lizard Union” to reform into a completely different entity. After unifying their home voivodeship, Jabłonowski ended up working closely with one Maciej Poręba, a notorious supporter of Russia and the pan-slavic ideology. This bizarre new state managed to crush their eastern neighbour - a united Pomeranian voivodeship, and have decided to head south instead of conquering Masuria, possibly due to its proximity to the Kaliningrad oblast. Poręba’s exact intentions are unknown, but it is certain that he aims to change the identity of Poland’s citizens forever, for better or for worse. His fanaticism combined with Jabłonowski’s seemingly unending fury make for a dangerous combination, and the so-called “slavic wolves” are adamant in their pursuit of a new nation built with fire and iron."

unificationsupreg.733.t: "[GetNewspaper]“Privislinsky Krai” returns"
unificationsupreg.733.desc: "The Greater Slavic State of Vistula, possibly the most pro-Russian contender in the Polish civil war ever since Jabłonowski’s ideas were rejected, has now gone beyond their home region of Pomerania and conquered a substantial amount of territory in central and western Poland, and adopted the old tsarist name of “Privislanskiy Krai'” which translates to Vistula Krai/Land. According to the government’s agenda, the citizens of what the world knows as Poland are not Poles, and that was never their true identity, but rather a façade, and the inhabitants of that territory are “Lechites” AKA “Slavic Wolves”, descendants of a supposed ancient civilisation called Lechina. Poręba is not the only proponent of the Lechina theory, but he is different from the others because he firmly believes the only way to restore and preserve Lechina is by cooperating with Russia and fulfilling their pan-Slavic vison. This is obviously a very controversial policy, and many in Poland are shocked by Poręba’s ideals. But this will not stop him – only war can."

super.733.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Wolfpack reigns supreme in a pro-Russian Poland"
super.733.desc: "A national rejuvenation is afoot in the nation formerly known as Poland, as Marcin Poręba’s “Privislanskiy Krai” shifts the politics of the country in a way never seen before in Polish history. It would be wrong to even call this state “Poland”, as Poręba has curbed both Jabłonowski’s influence, and virulent nationalism, as well as rooted out the Polish national identity. He has dubbed his citizens “Lechites” and considers them merely one of many cogs in the great Pan-Slavic machine which is powered by Russia. His vendetta against what he calls “the greatest lie in Lechite history” is yielding results, as there are already people in the Vistula Land who do not feel themselves to be Polish and believe in Poręba’s bizarre form of Pan-Slavism. But not everyone is so eager to follow their leader. As long as Jabłonowski and Poręba’s “wolfpack” of “slavic wolves” remains in power, they will need to face many challenges from their opposition. And they no doubt intend to conquer these challenges in the same way as they always have – with violence and terror."
super.733.a: "...Lord, preserve our wołodia!"
