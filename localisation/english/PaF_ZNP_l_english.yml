unification.204.t: "[GetNewspaper]Union of Polish Teachers' unifies Capital Region"
unification.204.desc: "A clique of ZNP originated from the protests pressuring the government to increase Polish teachers' wages. In recent years now that the government's gone the Union has focused on the protection of the unionised teachers and ensuring the local literacy rate and education quality won't surge down in the harsh environment. Their determination and general respect enabled them to eventually take over the Capital Region. Now it remains to be seen how the teachers' clique will rule such a large population. As of now, Sławomir Broniarz fills the office as the chairman of the Union as he has been since 1998. Known for his liberal sympathies, unflinching dedication to the welfare of teachers, and controversially high earnings, it's possible he won't relinquish power to the Polish nation, that used to disregard teachers' needs in the past."
