unification.204.t: "[GetNewspaper]Polish Teachers' Union unifies the Capital District"
unification.204.desc: "The ZNP clique originated during anti-government protests to increase the wages of the country’s teachers. With the government gone, however, the Union has since focused on the protection of the unionized teachers and ensuring that a baseline quality of education is maintained even in the harsh post-Fall environment. This seemingly selfless mission earned them many sympathizers, allowing for the eventual takeover of the Capital District. It remains to be seen how such a small and single-purpose organization will manage to rule over the millions residing in the Warsaw metropolis, especially since, under the surface, the seemingly-noble instutution, reveals itself to be just as undemocratic as could possibly be, with its chairman known primarily for two things - his thirty year long tenure in this position and his questionably high earnings. At least, if everything else fails, at least they will keep the schools running."
