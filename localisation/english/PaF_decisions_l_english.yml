collapse_ranged: "§gCOLLAPSE THE GUN PURCHASE LIST§!"
buy_german_ranged: "Buy German Guns"
buy_german_ranged_desc: "Ever since the European army halted its advance, the Eurokommissariats have devolved into what is basically a country-sized black market operation, and German guns became a commonly available good or even a currency of sorts. We don't even need to search for any German ex-soldiers or smugglers, we can just hit up any local arms dealer to get our hands on them."  
buy_swedish_ranged: "Buy Guns from Sweden"
buy_swedish_ranged_desc: "Very few Swedish guns have reached Poland due to the Swedish government's surprising reluctance to partake in the European intervention. Their scarcity has given them a certaint status among the populace, however, and the usage of them is seen as both more prestigious in the eyes of gangsters and as more patriotic than usage of German ones in the eyes of the commonfolk. Through our connections with the always enigmatic Master Weapon Dealer we can secure a large supply of armament provided by Swedish smugglers for ourselves." 
buy_ukrainian_ranged: "Make an Arms Deal with the Ukrainians"
buy_ukrainian_ranged_desc: "The Ukrainian Humanitarian Mission in Poland has fallen prey to saboteurs from Rzeszów and Nisko, leaving mostly those with a dubious reputation on our side of the border: nationalist ex-humanitarian workers enraged by Braun's betrayal and refusal of Ukrainian help, humanitarian workers who banded up together with Polish villagers and formed a joint quasi-military government of sorts, the few Ukrainian border guards who still occupy Medyka and gangsters. Gangsters who are more than willing to sell us their old armament, left behind by the Soviet government and the Russian army in 1991 and 2022."
buy_russian_ranged: "Buy Russian Guns"
buy_russian_ranged_desc: "Once Navalny took power in Moscow and started his crusade against the corruption and crime that have been synonymous with the Russian government since times immemorial, many Russkie mafiozos and gangbangers ran abroad, trying to escape his judgement. With no perspectives in life, seemingly left to die in a hostile world, they've been saved by the downfall of the Polish state which allowed them to get back to a life of crime by forming a competition to German arms dealers and even establishing back some of the old connections with pro-Russian Polish political organisations and the remains of the old guard of Russian politics."
buy_radom_ranged: "Sign an Arms Deal with Radom"
buy_radom_ranged_desc: "A real patriot supports domestic products, hence why we should hit up the arms manufacturers in Radom. There's even a certain Polish saying about this: \"cudze chwalicie, swego nie znacie\", which roughly translates to \"stop creaming yourself to foreign garbage and start appreciating our own shit instead\""."
buy_american_ranged: "Order American Guns"
buy_american_ranged_desc: "Even small-time American gun vendors can procure you with some *serious* firepower, and with the right connections it won't be that hard to smuggle their goods all the way to Europe. Let's get ourselves some *proper* liberation tools - shall we, pardner?"
buy_chinese_ranged: "Import Guns from China"
buy_chinese_ranged_desc: "Buying Chinese guns might be tricky, as we'll have to appeal for them to the Chinese government itself, plus... \n...we don't exactly know what to expect from them, as the only contact with Chinese guns that anyone in our government ever had was when that one accountant found Battlefield 4 installed on one of the computers we stole for one of our bureaus, so... Eh, at least if we choose our words right, we'll be able to make these military requests out as opening ourselves for future Chinese investments, which will surely and warm CCP's opinion about us and make future deals with them easier."

collapse_at: "§gCOLLAPSE THE AT WEAPON PURCHASE LIST§!"
buy_german_at: "Buy German Anti-Tank Weapons"
buy_german_at_desc: "The Germans didn't expect to meet any armored resistance on their way east, hence why they didn't took any AT together with themselves. However, as their advance got stopped and their stay in the country prolonged, the Bundeswehr had to migrate some of its stockpiles - including their anti-tank weaponry - to Poland, and we all know where those stockpiles ended up: on the local black market, where they are getting sold to the natives like beads. Not that we're complaining, of course - we'd be buying their weapons even if they were giving us smallpox."
buy_swedish_at: "Buy Anti-Tank Weapons from Sweden"
buy_swedish_at_desc: "After the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Sweden's admission to NATO, the Swedish Army started arming itself with large amounts of new anti-armor weaponry capable of easily halting any potential Russian tank invasions, and apart from buying foreign weapons, the Swedish state has also decided to perform a large-scale investment into local military corporations, hoping to achieve a higher autonomy in armament acquisition and to grow their weapon manufacturing market. This presents us with a golden opportunity to acquire some new, powerful anti-tank equipment with just a couple of corporate phone calls and one or two suitcases of cash."
buy_ukrainian_at: "Buy off Anti-Tank Weapons from Ukraine"
buy_ukrainian_at_desc: "What was supposted to be a Russian blitzkrieg ended up as a massive donation of free weapons to Ukraine - too bad most of these weapons are so badly made or just so ancient that they are of no real use for an army armed with tons of modern, Western equipment, and as such the Ukrainians opted to quickly get rid of them rather than to keep them clogging up their warehouses. As such, there are now lots of leftover Soviet-era weapons of all sorts (including RPGs and other AT weapons) that were used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces before they started receiving foreign aid and are now being sold by some soldiers looking to make a quick buck."
buy_russian_at: "Buy Russian Anti-Tank Weapons"
buy_russian_at_desc: "Apart from buying them from Ukrainian vendors, Russian weaponry can also be bought from various Russkie thugs escaping their home country or simply working as agents of the old Russian regime that is so desperately trying to restore its connections and influence in other countries. In fact, they can be found almost anywhere nowadays: on eBay, Alibaba, Allegro, or hell - even on fucking Wish.com - and it won't take too much of a hassle to simply order a couple of them on the Internet and to organize a way to safely bring them to our lands."
buy_radom_at: "Sign an Anti-Tank Weapons Deal with Radom"
buy_radom_at_desc: "Though in theory they're a warlord state of their own and a potential rival on the local political scene, the Radom Republic is home to the heart of the pre-Fall Polish weapon industry, and we should seek to sign some deals with them to get ourselves some new, relatively high-quality weaponry and to keep the Polish arms industry running."
buy_american_at: "Buy American Anti-Tank Weapons"
buy_american_at_desc: "Saint Javelina of 50 States, witness of the Mission, Freedom and Glory of the USA, who amazed everyone with your accuracy and effectiveness in the field of battle, and the ardent tongues of flame with which you surrounded Russian tanks: lead us on the path of victory of America. Make us trust in Her limitless power and desire to destroy everyone: the tanker and the infantryman. Have no mercy on the rebel, entangled in wrong ideology, enslaved by opposing warlords and lead them to the feet of our troops, where in tears of pain they will confess their weakness and will be slain. \nSaint Javelina, standing on the shoulder, lead us on the way of courage in our hardships, so that - when carrying you - we remember the blood of the enemy, which was first poured by us. \nHoly Javelina, welcoming the Victorious One, strenghten us in war, as if we're defenders who have fallen, and protect us from attaching unecessary importance to the matters of ethical warfare. May Victory be our way and the goal of our life as it was your goal. Amen."
buy_chinese_at: "Import Chinese Anti-Tank Weaponry"
buy_chinese_at_desc: "In 2020, the Chinese started exporting Hongjian-12s - their newest, top-notch man-portable guided AT missile systems. Possessing similar qualities to the Javelin, it seems very promising, but VERY costly, and there's very few countries who received them from China yet. This, however, means that from now on China will attempt to grow their anti-tank export and will have more of their older and/or less effective weapons to sell for other countries, which is - of course - very handy for us."

collapse_vests: "§gCOLLAPSE THE UNIFORM/PROTECTION PURCHASE LIST§!"
buy_german_vests: "Buy German Uniforms and Ballistic Vests"
buy_german_vests_desc: "After the Germans learned that they're forever doomed to sit in western Poland and defend it against nobody, they started settling down in the place of their guard posts instead. This lack of any need for military activity in the area made them abandon their army uniforms and sell them to those who'd make better use of them - to us."
buy_radom_vests: "Order Radom-Made Uniforms and Vests"
buy_radom_vests_desc: "Ever since the first few proclamations of rebel governments in Poland, Fabryka Broni 'Łucznik' opened up production lines for uniforms and protective vests to capitalize on the rapidly progressing organization of warlord militias in the area. The downfall of the whole country and constant marauding between factions in Eastern Poland may have cut Radom off from any sources of more advanced materials, but in return has provided the company with countless design tips and performance statistics allowing Łucznik to perfect their designs."
buy_swedish_vests: "Buy Uniforms & Protective Equipment from Sweden"
buy_swedish_vests_desc: "Sweden won't make for a good ballistic vest supplier, but it will be the perfect place to buy high-quality hunting uniforms and military winter clothes from. They will cost quite a lot of KROMER, though."
buy_ukrainian_vests: "Buy off old Uniforms and Protective Equipment from the Ukrainians"
buy_ukrainian_vests_desc: "The fires of war in Ukraine may have been snuffed out, but that still didn't mean the end of problems for the Ukrainian people. Many conscripts have returned to their homes only to find them completely ruined, along with all of their possessions, and now they have to find whatever means they can to be able to at least partially regain what they've lost. As such, many have put their no longer needed uniforms and other equipment up for grabs for foreigners on the Internet - we just have to keep in mind that most of them have seen heavy use and possess some combat damage."
buy_russian_vests: "Buy Russian Uniforms and Protective Vests"
buy_russian_vests_desc: "Russian uniforms...? \n\n\n...are you sure? \n...do we really wanna buy those?"
buy_american_vests: "Buy Uniforms and Ballistic Vests from America"
buy_american_vests_desc: "Light civilian vests can be imported from America as easily as, say, apples. Importing heavier, rifle-defeating vests is gonna be difficult, though, as ITAR doesn't like those. Thankfully, we've got contacts with the right people, who are be able to arrange the import of even heaviest, US Army-grade vests and military uniforms from the land of the free to the land of milk and honey."
buy_chinese_vests: "Import Uniforms and Protective Vests from China"
buy_chinese_vests_desc: "Truth be told, we've got absolutely no idea how good those actually are. Buying them is gonna win us some favors with the CCP, however, so it's worth the risk, I guess."

buy_german_melee: "Buy German Melee Equipment"
buy_german_melee_desc: "The Germans wasted away so much of their own equipment, that now almost everyone in Poland is utilizing some of it on a daily basis. If you ever see some tableware, shovels, picks, fire starting tools or other such items in a Polish household - it's most likely they got that stuff from the Germans."
buy_swedish_melee: "Buy Melee Equipment from Sweden"
buy_swedish_melee_desc: "German equipment, though much easier to acquire, tends to already possess marks of previous usage. Thankfully, if we ever find ourselves in need of factory new equipment, we can hook up our connections in Sweden and get ourselves some brand new Ikea tools and utensils from them."
buy_ukrainian_melee: "Buy Melee Equipment from the Ukrainians"
buy_ukrainian_melee_desc: "Western donations and Russian logistical incompetence have left the Ukrainians with copious amounts of old, mismatched army equipment that is completely useless for a modern army which the Armed Forces of Ukraine is striving to become. There's lots of offers and auctions put up by Ukrainian sellers on the Internet, we just need to find somebody who could smuggle their goods to Poland."
buy_russian_melee: "Buy Melee Equipment from the Russians"
buy_russian_melee_desc: "The Russian army might fail to provide its soldiers with tools and equipment, but there's still plenty of commercial szpej manufacturers and sellers in Russia who'd be willing to supply us with some of their products in exchange for cash and political capital."
buy_radom_melee: "Buy Radom-Made Melee Equipment"
buy_radom_melee_desc: "Even before the Fall, FB Łucznik produced not only guns, but also military-grade equipment such as bayonets, toolboxes and ammo boxes. Nowadays, their offer includes even more types of tools and utensils, since now they're responsible for supplying the army of Radom Republic. While their prices might be higher than those of Russian gangsters or German small-time smugglers, their products are a symbol of respect for those whom we conquer, and most importantly - what we buy from them is made to order, unlike the equipment resold to us by criminals and Internet vendors."

Thankfully, in some regions of Poland, coal deposits can be reached by simply digging in ground with a shovel, so if we ever find ourselves running short on coal supplies, we can open up small, temporary bootleg mines for a quick gain of resources.

In the past, we already gave them the access to power once, and now we see the results of that. We cannot let it happen again, so STAND UP, PEOPLE!

Therefore - how about we offer these people contracts for *temporary* army duty? The Russian government used a similar method of hiring new people for the army during their invasion of Ukraine, where anyone of working age could simply hit up their local wojenkomat (army drafting commitee, or WKU in Polish) and sign up for service on the front for a limited time. These contract troops would receive their salary only after some time spent on the front, meaning that many of them died without even getting paid, meaning that we can use this conscription method to gain new recruits while simultaneously keeping our money."

In fact, using the clergy as henchmen for gathering additional taxes from our loyalists is already common in the our administration, so it's completely fine if we ask them for a handout to cover our army's upkeep - after all, every grosz not spent on our forces is a grosz earned by Germans, Russians and lefties!"

Our armed forces are meant to be but a security force that is organized by ourselves and is guarding our lands and interests from enemies. And we treat them as such, upkeeping and arming them ourselves. Because of that we also don't need to follow any set norms or standards when handling their equipment - they're OUR OWN business, so we are allowed to provide them with equipment in any way we could possibly like to, e.g. with cheaply produced 3D printed guns, instead of expensive, real ones."
