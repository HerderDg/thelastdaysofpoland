unification.25.t: "[GetNewspaper]Chorzów unifies Upper Silesia!"
unification.25.desc: "For many years, people dreamed about a Polish Silesia. When it finally happened, the dreams changed as well. Because, in the end, it was Silesia that started dreaming about freedom. At the beginning, they only wanted the autonomy they enjoyed during the Second Polish Republic. But as the years went by and the Polish state disintegrated, the revisionist voices grew louder. The Fall did not mean the end for everyone, for the Silesians it was the beginning of a new path. Jerzy Gorzelik tried to unite all the Silesian factions under the politically unstable Silesian League. This, however, did not last due to factional hesitations, which eventually led to secession from the league and wars.\n\nBut it is from Chorzów that the heart of Silesia now beats, irreplaceable blue and yellow colors flutter in the wind, and Silesians look into the future for the first time free, and for the first time with hope for a better tomorrow."
