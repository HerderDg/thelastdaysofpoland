unification.79.t: "[GetNewspaper]Bishopric of Inowrocław unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.79.desc: "Despite the near-absolute dissipation of Church authority over the recent Polish history, it appears that the millennium-old institution is far from drawing its final breath. After a series of decisive military campaigns, forces loyal to its officially appointed structures, gathered around the leadership of the nation's Primate, have managed to subdue the entirety of Kuyavia-Pomerania, establishing theocratic governance across the Vistula's fertile valleys. The victory marks a turning point for a region previously carefully sympathetic to liberal tendencies, now seeing a slow return to traditional values and faithful adherence to religious teachings. So far, despite undoubtedly stabilizing the voivodeship and gaining a favorable position among the remaining warlords, the state has received no official acknowledgment from the Vatican despite rumors of extensive communication and cooperation between the two, needing to establish itself further before having a chance to claim the Holy Father's blessing."
unification.79.a: "In nomine Patris..."

super.79.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.79.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.79.a: "United at last."

 ##IDEAS##
 
INO_laiki: "Encroaching Laicisation"
INO_laiki_desc: "All across the country, churches slowly crumble, seminaries close, and the aging priests preach pitiful sermons to row upon row of empty pews. After only two generations, Poland's religious revival has faded, leaving the people astray from the faith their ancestors tirelessly nurtured under communist repression. With the Church's authority at an all-time low, the Primate's decrees are met with nothing but silence, broken only by faint murmurs of approval from the few remaining faithful - as decrepit as the religion they cling to. Soon, even these final voices may fade."

INO_nasz_maly_watykan: "The Church's Righful Arm"
INO_nasz_maly_watykan_desc: "While every overly ambitious preacher voices their pretensions of divine guidance, only we have the legal claim to being an extension of the Throne of St. Peter's jurisdiction over all earthly matters. While heretics and schismatics may stoke the flame of religious zealotry, their words will never rise beyond the ravings of blithering madmen, standing foolishly against the infallible wisdom and judgment of God. With his favor, we shall endure whatever challenges end up being thrown against us. The allure of blind fervor will never sway the hearts of the faithful."

INO_kler: "The excesses of the 'Kler'"
INO_kler_desc: "Once the bedrock of the faith, the clerical class has since earned the ire of the wider religious community. Those who once swore to serve as the shepherds of the faithful flock have become mired in moral corruption, preaching about Christian values while acting as the same personification of sin they so eagerly chastize. With each of the semi-regular scandals chipping away at the remnants of the Church's claim to uphold its own doctrine, we must find a way to purge this rotten residue from our ranks... or at least keep it under wraps."
