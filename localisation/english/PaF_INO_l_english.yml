unification.79.t: "[GetNewspaper]Bishopric of Inowrocław unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.79.desc: "Despite the near-absolute dissipation of Church authority over the recent Polish history, it appears that the millennium-old institution is far from drawing its final breath. After a series of decisive military campaigns, forces loyal to its officially appointed structures, gathered around the leadership of the nation's Primate, have managed to subdue the entirety of Kuyavia-Pomerania, establishing theocratic governance across the Vistula's fertile valleys. The victory marks a turning point for a region previously carefully sympathetic to liberal tendencies, now seeing a slow return to traditional values and faithful adherence to religious teachings. So far, despite undoubtedly stabilizing the voivodeship and gaining a favorable position among the remaining warlords, the state has received no official acknowledgment from the Vatican despite rumors of extensive communication and cooperation between the two, needing to establish itself further before having a chance to claim the Holy Father's blessing."
