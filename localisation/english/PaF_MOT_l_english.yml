unification.72.t: "[GetNewspaper]Motorcracy of Gorzów unifies Northern Greater Poland"
unification.72.desc: "Tonight, fragments of the S3, 24 and 92 connecting Gorzów Wielkopolski with Poznań will relive their pre-Fall lives for a day, as a massive horde of TIR trucks, motorbikes and cars is set to roll from one city to another in a Roman-style triumph celebrating the complete conquest of the northern halves of Lubusz and Greater Polish voivodeships by the so-called Motorcracy of Gorzów - a joint 'government' of marauding roughnecks united in their love of breakneck speeds. Despite the limited availability of fuel in the country, the veteran speedfreaks of the Motorcracy overtook the local warlording Poles and Germans and made it to the finish line, securing the trophy that is northern Greater Poland for themselves. As the Motorcracy takes control of the region, citizens can expect a new era of fast-paced anarchy, where the only law that matters is the law of the road. Buckle up, Greater Poland - it's going to be a wild ride!"
unification.72.a: "On the open roads, they are truly free."

super.72.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.72.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.72.a: "United at last."
