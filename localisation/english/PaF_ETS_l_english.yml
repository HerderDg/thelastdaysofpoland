unification.127.t: "[GetNewspaper]Combine of Starachowice unifies Holy Cross!"
unification.127.desc: "Tyranny reigns in the Holy Cross Voivodeship no more. The dictator, Ziobro, has been toppled for good, banished from the region by an overwhelming popular uprising. Defiant against the General Prosecutor, the Combine of Starachowice managed to not only hinder his advance in the War for the Northern Counties, not just deliver the death blow to his crumbling regime, but to stand tall above all other warlords, spreading the system of anarchic communism with each victory over the forces of statism. The entire voivodeship now finds itself adherent to this unfamiliar form of government, coming together to participate in the first state-wide election to fill the seats of the temporarily vacant councils. While skepticism towards this new order still persists to its fullest, now that the people no longer have an all-powerful state constantly breathing down their necks, they might just find themselves enjoying this newfound freedom."
unification.127.a: "No gods, no masters."
