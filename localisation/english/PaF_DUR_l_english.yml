 unification.181.t: "[GetNewspaper]DURŚ unifies the Silesian Metropolis"
 unification.181.desc: "Few in Poland expected DURŚ to survive the chaos, let alone emerge as masters of the Silesian Metropolis. Yet under the steady hand of Łukasz Kohut, the Democratic Union of Silesian Regionalists has stitched together a functioning government from Katowice to Racibórz, bearing the gold-blue banner with renewed pride. Once seen as a soft puppet of the Eurokommissariats, DURŚ was nearly swept away by a brutal neonazi revolt that briefly tore through the industrial belt. The scars remain - on the walls and in their internal politics. \nNow free from the threats, the Union treads carefully. Its institutions are growing, its rhetoric pacifist, but its ambition quietly regionalist. There's talk of Silesian schooling, cultural councils, and even…an independence from Poland. For some, it's a triumph of local democracy. For others, a warning that Europe's peripheries are no longer content being administered. In the heart of what was once Upper Silesia, the past is never buried - it's part of their heritage."
 unification.181.a: "And it's breaking free."
