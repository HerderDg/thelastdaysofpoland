 LODZ_VOIVODESHIP_SHORT: "Pride comes before the Fall. And The Fall turned the time upside down. During the Polish-German war, Bundeswehr troops managed to seize a good portion of the former Greater Poland voivodeship. In its southern territories, the invasion stopped on the rivers of Warta and Prosna, which didn’t leave much space in the province. The newly founded Eurokommissariat Schlesien guards the borders of its domain, and on the other side of the rivers, the Polish Anarchy gave birth to a real-life picture of the past - three major warlords representing three different stages of history. Sarmatian nobles from the golden age of Polish history, a medieval feudal state in Gniezno and its domains, and the resurrected Roman Empire in Kalisz are collectively trying to bring down the European invader, but were they succeed, it won’t take much time for them to turn against each other and fight amongst themselves for the title of the best historical role-player."

 coal_desc: "Coal was used mainly to produce electricity and heat buildings, but now that most of the country's industry is dead, it has also found its way back in metal making and forging."
