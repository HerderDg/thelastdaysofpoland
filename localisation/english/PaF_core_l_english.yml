 LODZ_VOIVODESHIP_SHORT: "Pride comes before a Fall. And The Fall came really abruptly. Internal struggle mixed with German tanks brought end to the Third Polish Republic and though Bundeswehr did not reach Łódź, the city has been struck by almost apocalyptic event - sudden atomic explosion. Although the disappearance of Bałuty in a nuclear fire was not of great economic importance, it led to total collapse of the power structures in the voivodeship. Once beautiful landscapes of Łódź turned into barbaric wastelands, ruled by not entirely normal warlords such as coal cultists, bloodthirsty scouts, ruthless capitalists, Yahweh fans, or supporters of the kingdom straight from The Witcher.\nBut one man - Szymon Hołownia - took power in Łódź and, using the power of Dialogue, reconciled the warring tribes. Does his Pax Hołownia have a chance to survive?"
