The once 'beautiful' landscapes of Łódź turned into barbaric wastelands, ruled by not so quite normal warlords."

 LODZ_VOIVODESHIP_SHORT: "Pride comes before a Fall. And The Fall came really abruptly. Internal struggle mixed with German tanks brought end to the Third Polish Republic and though Bundeswehr did not reach Łódź, the city has been struck by almost apocalyptic event - sudden atomic explosion. Although the disappearance of Bałuty in a nuclear fire was not of great economic importance, it led to total collapse of the power structures in the voivodeship. Once beautiful landscapes of Łódź turned into barbaric wastelands, ruled by not entirely normal warlords such as coal cultists, bloodthirsty scouts, ruthless capitalists, Yahweh fans, or supporters of the kingdom straight from The Witcher.\nBut one man - Szymon Hołownia - took power in Łódź and, using the power of Dialogue, reconciled the warring tribes. Does his Pax Hołownia have a chance to survive?"
 synthetic_materials_desc: "Plastics, rubber, et cetera. Most things are made from them, although in post-Fall Poland they have to be used sparingly. Because of this, usage of them in the military sector has been mostly boiled down to manufacturing weapons and vulcanization."
 coal_desc: "Coal was used mainly to produce electricity and heat buildings, but now that most of the country's industry is dead, it has also found its way back in metal making and forging."
 electronics_desc: "Cables, parts, compartments and various electronic devices that are (...or at least used to be) present in all parts of daily life. Used militarily in advanced vehicles, computers and other devices and technologies."
 junk_desc: "All kinds of trash that can still be recycled or reused without the risk of getting infected with HIV, ass worms and malaria."
