 LODZ_VOIVODESHIP_SHORT: "Pride comes before the Fall. And The Fall turned the time upside down. During the Polish-German war, Bundeswehr troops managed to seize a good portion of the former Greater Poland voivodeship. In its southern territories, the invasion stopped on the rivers of Warta and Prosna, which didn't leave much space in the province. The newly founded Eurokommissariat Schlesien guards the borders of its domain, and on the other side of the rivers, the Polish Anarchy gave birth to a real-life picture of the past - three major warlords representing three different stages of history. Sarmatian nobles from the golden age of Polish history, a medieval feudal state in Gniezno and its domains, and the resurrected Roman Empire in Kalisz are collectively trying to bring down the European invader, but were they succeed, it won't take much time for them to turn against each other and fight amongst themselves for the title of the best historical role-player."
 POMORZE_VOIVODESHIP_SHORT: "While the swift fall of Pomerania provided ample opportunity for the Eurokorps forces to establish stable collaborative governments, this was thrown away in the name of paranoia over supposed destabilizing elements lurking within. Local officials were recalled one by one, replaced by designated eurogovernors and officers. The initally pro-european western Polish population saw this as a sign of betrayal, the facade of an intervention to "preserve Polish democracy" falling apart. Now the bureaucratic machine of the Eurokomissariats becomes aware of the mess of their own making."

 food_desc: "Because to live, you need to eat, and to eat, you need to live. The foundation of any nation's survival, food ensures both the physical and moral endurance of the population. Rationing, agricultural output, and supply chains define whether armies march or nations starve. After all, without food, even the greatest ambitions crumble."
