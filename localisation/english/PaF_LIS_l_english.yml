 unification.187.t: "[GetNewspaper]Lisowczycy unite Southern Greater Poland!"
 unification.187.desc: "Once clouds of dust kicked up in the air by a mass of death-dealing armoured riders settled around regional capitals of Kalisz, Leszno and Gniezno, it became clear that Lisowczycy under Colonel Wojciech Drewniak attained superiority over the region. With fire and sword, the ranks of cavalrymen defeated scattered warlords of southern Greater Poland, allowing their infamous Colonel to take hold of the land in a tight grip. To fully establish their dominion over newly conquered territories, grand parades of famed riders take place in cities and bigger towns, waving the black hedgehog banner with Colonel Wojciech Drewniak at the helm. As fires stoked by the Lisowczycy across the lands of southern Greater Poland die down, it remains to be seen if the horsemen of apocalypse continue their deadly march onwards, and if the current historical curriculum taught across the lands endures."
 unification.187.a: "Kaliskie Bez Cenzury."

 POLITICS_WOJCIECH_DREWNIAK_DESC: "In one point of their modern history, a new generation of Poles found themselves disconnected from their past. They did not feel it wasn't theirs, but rather completely unappealing. Some men set off to change this, and the first of them was Wojciech Drewniak. \n\nDrewniak took Polish (and not only Polish) history, smeared it with blood and cum and started selling it to the public as "Uncensored History" YouTube show. Was it historically accurate? No. Was it funny and engaging? No, unless you were an adolescent. Nonetheless, a whole generation of Poles enjoyed tons of lame, regurgitated jokes and stereotypes, which shaped their idea of their past. \n\nNow, past has been reborn, and what have the people thought of it up until now is shaping reality. Among those who wish to ride the wave, there are those who do not care as much about what kind of past they surf on, as much as it's made of blood and cum. And for those, once again, Wojciech Drewniak caters. \n\nThe once popular youtuber emerged in Terra Felix as if from nowhere, and found the perfect bit of the past to base himself: the lisowczycy, famously brave and infamously cruel band of Polish mercenaries from the 17th Century. Those who just wanna to see the world burn while wearing a fancy outfit flock to him, as well as those who find the somewhat conservative and rigid structure of Terra Felix too uncomfortable for their ambitions and expectations of the future. As long as their sabers are turned outwards, they will be valuable proteges of Professor Hetman, and protectors of the nascent Commonwealth. \n\nBut once this ends, Europe shall burn once more."
