NED_ojczyzna: "A Lost Homeland"
NED_ojczyzna_desc: "The Dutch nation is gone. It may remain on the map, at least for now, but it is fully lost in spirit. Our country dissolved in the European melting pot, leaving it unrecognizable to the homeland we swore to fight for. As if that pain hadn't already been searing enough, our German overlords tasked us with inflicting the same fate on the Union's eastern flank. We tried to desert, join the fight for national sovereignty, but those we wished to aid collapsed before we got that chance. Now, we're trapped in the ruins of a fallen country, locked between those we renounced and those who still see us as invaders. And in the middle of it all stands the final bastion of a truly independent Netherlands, exiled on foreign soil. Its history will end along with us."

NED_oledrzy: "Nieuwe Olęderse Nederzetting"
NED_oledrzy_desc: "Lush riverland fields, unending swathes of flatlands stretching over the horizon... if anything, this place feels like home - that same home we will likely never be able to return to. A few hundred years ago, some of our compatriots found this area so appealing that they chose to settle it permanently. Though they are long gone by now, on patrols, we can still often see the structures they left behind. Many of our soldiers have spent most of their lives on campaign. They deserve to finally lay down their arms and enjoy the years they have left. We never imagined that this is where we'd spend our retirement, but it is far from the worst place imaginable."
