BBW_trial_of_three_desc:0 "It worked. Finally, after months of efforts, we managed to catch the bombers responsible for blowing up the Brotherhood post in Szczerców. We caught them almost red-handed - while they were preparing another bomb in one of their caches in Bełchatów itself. Soon there will be a meeting of the Elder Council that will decide their fate. It still bothers me, what made them do it... We gave them electricity, we kept civilization and developed it, despite the turmoil of war. How could they give up a normal life and… kill these people. Three teenagers, they've barely graduated. Why would they blow up others in cold blood? There is still so much confusion... I don't understand why the investigative team waited until the day of the trial with the announcement of the evidence ... My God, let this madness be finally cleared..."

BBW_riots_desc:0 "18 years in prison for all three. Yesterday the guards escorted them to the prison in Edwardów. They couldn't break through the cordon of people chanting "death" in the direction of the transport bus.\n\nI haven't left the house today. I tried to cut myself off from all the confusion for a moment by writing a new book but nothing wants to stick together. I just walk from wall to wall. A moment ago, Tomek called, said that in the city people are still standing in the streets. Among them were seen members of the victims' families dressed in black. I can't sit here forever, but what should I do? If we try to get the situation under control, we will turn out to be soulless as PiS rabble from before the war. No, we can't appear to be like them. One must wait and pray that time will heal all wounds. The guards will be on the alert, but I hope they won't leave the barracks. It's over for today. I need to sleep, I have to be in full strength. We don't know what tomorrow will bring."

Łukasz did not pick up the phone until after midnight.\n\n- Are you sure about this? - I asked.\n\n- Yeah, absolutely. Scribe Ziemkiewicz, we don't have time for empty talk. You know what's waiting under our noses. The Brotherhood Council meeting is in three hours' time, attendance is mandatory.\n\nHe hung up after these words. I walked over to the guard and let him know I was going out onto the balcony. The cigarette glow was the only thing that illuminated the area around my dacha. There is a deafening silence all around. Just the murmuring of the sentries in the bushes. I took a puff and the smoke filled my lungs. The tension kind of eased. But I still felt the blood pulsing rapidly through my veins. If Łukasz addresses someone by the title in an informal conversation, it means that it is really very bad.\n\n- Knight Mark! - I growled at the sentry behind the glass balcony door. - Get yourselves and the car ready. We're about to leave for town."

People go to work in the mines, shops, workshops, just like before, but nothing changes with me. Today, these teenagers' testimonies landed on my desk. They were terribly reticent. But it is impossible not to notice how much hatred has accumulated in them. Although they were handcuffed, they threatened that the days of the Brotherhood are numbered, that someone would finally take on us and the power plants would be blown up. And the slogans about the dying nature... here's the reward for trying to keep at least a bit of normality for people. They wanted to kill us for pork chops on tables, electricity in sockets and running water in the taps. They said we have blood on the hands of all those who will be swallowed by the doom that we will bring..."

Just like the people and deeds they praise. Italian marble will be transformed into an image of strength and seriousness by the best available artists - former students of the Łódź Academy of Fine Arts. Inside, there will be a large, steel stove from which smoke will blow forever - a symbol of work, transformation and power. Something that in comparison the miserable explosion of a makeshift bomb will only be an infinitely imperfect tracing of… ourselves. An unsurpassed formula. The smell of burning coal will take this thought a long way. \n\nOkay, enough of this propaganda for today. I need a drink. But not too much, unfortunately. Tomorrow the "work" will be handed over..."

And this time as well. The street is boiling again. Fortunately, everyone has got used to the smell of burning. Nobody feels anything anymore, nobody sees anything.

If there were something behind them, some… human… something… alive, it would be unpleasant.\n\nAnd so everything goes like a charm. The new book on the shelf practically writes itself.

There is no need to worry about smog or other crap when you can or even have to hit the ground with a shovel and get a guarantee of safety and power from it. Only a petty man feeds on fear.\n\nDespite the lack of machinery and the need to rely on manual labor, we are on the right track to achieving prosperity. Each hit in the ground will cause an avalanche of the next and the next, and black gold will flow to power plants, our homes and abroad for the benefit of all of us."\n\nRafał Ziemkiewicz once again looked at the content of the article he just sketched. After a while, he happily grabbed the glass of cognac. He took a deep sip of the amber liquid and grasped his chin thoughtfully over a piece of freshly written paper. "It's okay," he thought.

They don't like us, of course, but they all want lit streets, hot water taps and a working industry. An attack on us would be costly and would result in a loss of supply. Besides, there would be no end to the wars to take control of the power plant. Everyone would like to own it, and this could lead to chaos and destruction of the facility. So we need to sit down at the table and talk. The Bełchatów Railway Station is bursting at the seams with all kinds of materials sent as payment for electricity.

Without steel, it is impossible to successfully extract it, fight other contenders for power or put houses in the place of ruins. Even though we do not have direct iron deposits, scrap metal around us is abundant. This is considered gross by some to recycle, but in fact it is a whole new production cycle. Our new American economics expert, Christian Paulson, believes so.\n\nAfter all, recycling is basically an individual activity, and here a large plant will be responsible for it. If its area formally covers all our dominion, then there will be no question of collecting garbage but only "using scattered warehouses of semi-finished materials"\n\nThat is why it was rightly recognized at the meeting of the Council that building a large steam scrap yard is a historic necessity. The Steam Combine "Citadel" will soon be operational. You can already see the smoke over Parzno, the blackest one can imagine.\n\nThousands of tons of steel each year ready to be turned into something useful..."

Thanks to the money for exports and skilful management, we managed to get the necessary materials. Soon, a narrow stream of energy flowing to the market will turn into real Yangtze. Chances are our "trading partners" won't be able to resist it.\n\nMoreover, together with the new unit, new plants will be built and those for which there was no capacity before, will be reopened as well. It's wonderful to be rich. Everyone will admit it. And the more wealth the better. Hence the new Council decision to allocate a portion of the money directly to the people. In the end, they deserved it, and the money released on the market will come back to us anyway. And that's the way it should be."

belchatow.1.desc:0 "The Brotherhood court, located in the small building of the confiscated flyover, was bursting at the seams. The Trial of the Three, as the press loudly wrote about this event, was on the lips of all residents of Bełchatów from the moment when the date of the Trial was announced. In other cities, people listened to CB radios, and the Internet, from where it was still reachable, they waited impatiently for the next lines of text of the account written by one of the scribes. Some, despite reprimands, brought framed photos of victims to the building. \n\nWhat happened in the courtroom itself can only be described as pure chaos. Despite the instructions and frantic intervensions of the guards, the crowd of viewers still raised angry cheers at the three inconspicous teenagers. Two of them stared impassively at the desk of the accused. Third one, the youngest, looked aggressively towards the tribunal and at the onlookers, inciting them to further screams and threats. And so far a few hours until everyone, tired of the procedures, began to listen to the accusations.\n\nAt least the chief prosecutor - Paladin Tomasz Sommer did not take the floor. Summoned by the tribunal, he had difficulty controlling his emotions by reading the findings of the investigative commision from the sheet of paper. \n\n-"The accused acted within an organized criminal group describing itself as the "League of Enviromantal Defenders", planning with the help of terror to overthrow the state apparatus and to bring about social changes in the spirit of misuderstood and radical protection of nature..." \n\nOn the spot, the tribunal was forced to interrupt the hearing and lead the accused and the spectators out. The roar of the word "Death!" bouncing off the walls of the auditorium was overhelming"

Suddently a young woman approaches him briskly, the security staff reacting too late. A gun is fired. The girl was the daughter of one of the guards. Paladin Tomasz Sommer gets shot in a heart and dies on his way to the hospital at 1:46 pm. The attacker was caught immediately. \n\n13:49 - Information about the attack spreads rapidly, social anger leads the crowds of people to the streets in solidarity with the Brotherhood. \n\n13:57 - Prisoners, after hearing about the attack on Tomasz from a smuggled radio, have lynched the accused from the "Trial of Three". The prison guards only reacted after a long while. Two of the inmates are killed, the third is in a serious condition and goes to the prison infirmary. At 2:23 AM the next day, he was put into a coma in hospital. \n\n14:03 - A spontaneous demonstration reaches the hedquarters of the Brotherhood. Several thousand people are demanding safety and immediate punishment of the guility part."

belchatow.3.desc:0 "Tadek, a newly minted adept of the Brotherhood, found out that he had been assigned to guard the ceremony of unveiling a monument the day before the event itself. He did not smile too much because he had a pass scheduled then and was drinking with other novices. "There is no way out, only you are available now, I will not take those junks from outside the city now," the voice of the Sergeant Knight rumbled in his head. Well, I have to pull myself together, put a rifle on shoulder, a plate on chest and keep order on the steam tram going from Wola Mikorska to Steel Park - the former Olszewski Park, where the composition of sculptures that was the source of the problem was to stand.\n\nTadek didn't really care why they put it there, who was supposed to be on them, etc. They didn't pay him for being interested. But something was in the air. In the Tram, only the sounds of the boiler interrupted the deaf silence. The people dressed in black did not even look out of the windows at the landscape, which was clouded by smoke. Tadek was afraid to talk to anyone. Even the Chief Knight who looked like a good bloke.\n\nWhen they got there, everyone saw a huge, several meters long… block. From a speech by some balding bighead, Tadek learned that the sculpture is dedicated to those who died in an attack from a few months ago and the newest victim of "green terror" - the Paladin Sommer. The great cauldron in the center of the monument obscured the blue sky with black clouds.\n\nThe young adept felt in his bones that people were clearly agitated by the whole matter. They were silent until the very end, even during the ride back. In the evening, Tadek, already off duty, relaxed with the desired beer and thought..."

belchatow.4.t:0 "Uneasy Council"
belchatow.4.desc:0 "The entire council of a dozen or so of the Brotherhood, despite the late hour, debated the newly obtained evidence with incredible vigor. These were letters full of particularly disturbing information. Finally, the chaotic discussion gave way to order, when the Scribe Stefan Janecki slammed his fist on the table so hard that a pile of old rubber boots collapsed near the tiled stove in the corner of the room. The guards frantically began putting it back together.\n\n- Dear Brothers, I don't think we have any doubts that this green plague is stronger than anyone might have previously suspected. By our inattention, we have brought up a bunch of ingrates and dreamers who, through their stupidity, can bring us all doom. A generation of parasites...\n\nSenior Paladin Witold Gadomski - Head of the Ministry of Economy, immediately raised his hand.\n\nExactly so! We have failed, we have handed over the younger generation and some of the old to eco-terrorists and climate liars! How did the Wiech's writings reached to the people?! We've slept well for too long and now we're going to bear the consequences. The attacks so far are only the beginning, for certain, and we will have the "Wiechowszczyzna". We must act. Scribe Janecki's department is already preparing proscription lists.\n\nThe said Chief of Intelligence nodded knowingly.\n\n- Excellent - replied paladin Łukasz Warzecha, Head of the Infrastructure Department.\n- Brothers, let us remember that many of our...fellow citizens are still faithful to good standards and if they found out what is really going on, they would support us with their body and soul. It would be good to use their enthusiasm.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Paladin Łukasz continued -\n\n- I think we have reached a consensus. Knight Krzysztof - announce the brown alarm. We are on the brink of a new era, and only a wretched group of green crooks is keeping us from embracing it.\n\nThe knight started throwing rubber boots into the tiled stove. After a while, brown smoke, discernible only to the eager eyes of the initiated brethren (it barely stood out against the gray-black sky), gave signal for a secret mobilization."

You could easily see what happened at night. Most of the windows were broken and shards of glass rustled under the feet of the loitering passers-by. Each of them seemed to ignore the destruction. Only from time to time, some people stopped in front of the signs of radioactivity painted with green paint. After a while, Andrzej himself began to look at them curiously.\n\nThese symbols were found only on those buildings that had their doors torn off their hinges. The bystanders seemed to be pleased with the effects of the night's "riots"\n\n- Knight Andrzej! Get Your ass moving and working! I'm a Scribe, so i won't do your damn job for you! There is no time to enjoy the views.\n\nBut of course, Scribe Jakub, of course...\n\nA small detachment entered one of the most devastated buildings - a small apartment block. Andrzej clenched his sweaty hands on his SMG RAK. His working day has begun...\n\n\n***\n\nList of Suspects. Entry No. 120.\n\nAddress - REDACTED\n\nReporting Officer - Junior Scribe Jakub W.\n\n“First apartment - single marriage, suspected green media job before the Fall. Husband has 4 teeth knocked out and both legs broken. Wife with a black eye.\n\nSecond apartment - a family of five. Three teenagers included. Found green literature in the form of the book "Not Everything for a Dump". The book was burnt. The youth were arrested for interrogation and rehabilitation purposes. Parents under supervision.\n\nThird apartment - Lonely man. A bum. He performed prohibited recycling in the form of collecting cans for illegal purchase. Material evidence was confiscated. He resisted and attacked the unit. He was intoxicated. Junior Knight Andrzej neutralized him with a burst from SMG. Application for decoration sent to the council...""

Its passengers, mostly youth from nearby schools, either tried to sleep off or looked at the landscape behind dirty windows, almost invisible due to the smog and late hours. A dozen or so of them, the entire newly established class from one of the Bełchatów high schools, clearly differed from the rest. They were huddled and scared, just staring blankly at the floor beneath their feet.\n\nAfter a while the bus slowed down and finally stopped in front of the metal gate. Passengers spilled outside at the sound of screams chasing them. They were lined up. Someone approached the freshmen with a submachine gun in his hand.\n\n- I am the Knight Mateusz and from today you are to speak to me in this way. And you will say everything that I ask you about. Understand?\n\n- Yes, sir! - answered the now-awakened freshmen\n\n- Good, due to the increased demand for coal, you have been mobilized to work in the mine. You will have excuses for school absences. Maybe they even increase Your behavior marks, he he. The case looks like this - 12 hours a day's work, and a half-hour break at 12:00.

There, they listened to the speeches of one of the Elder Knights or Junior Paladins about the need for immediate mobilization. The enemy is close, right outside our gates, and we must eradicate him.\n\nThe tram then traveled across town to the training base in the village of Kanada. This place had the reputation of a terrible murder-hole, but the conscripts knew that without pain, they would not ensure permanent economic growth. Once they got out, they were immediately brutally restrained and then shaved bald and stripped. Then, naked, they landed in the initiation room where, using a piece of coal, symbols were drawn on their bodies that they had to swear on - Mine, Lightning and the Black Steam. The fumes of burning fine coal put them in an ecstatic mood. They felt strong, ready to fulfill their historical role. Their mission had just begun..."

However, the Brotherhood's media representative did not know what to do with himself.\n\nHe just played with a fork stuck in a bowl of macaroni and cheese, mockingly known as spaghetti. He didn't know what to feel. Anger, fear, or maybe ... pride in the decision-making nature of the organization to which he belonged. He was fresh from the last meeting of the Council. He knew what was about to happen. He knew what would happen in this city and on this earth. His hands started shaking. The thought of a nip of cognac wrapped in the Brotherhood's robe (the council's latest idea) secretly flashed through his mind. He drank it all in one gulp. He calmed down. There is no way out. Must start writing. Tomorrow's announcement needs to be ready. As well as those for all the next days…."

POLITICS_RAFAL_ZIEMKIEWICZ_DESC:0 "Rafał Ziemkiewicz - (born September 14, 1964) - A journalist, writer, visionary and a man of common sense. Few are of more merit to the Brotherhood than it's elder and first scribe. When the country around was plunged into chaos, his person was uniting people around lasting survival and restoration of normality based on the technological superiority of coal energy and hierarchical order. Though his leadership is largely nominal, he is considered the most respected person of the Brotherhood. His books, widely popularized on Brotherhood territories after the Fall of Poland created a vision of new, better future – based on rough interests, on fighting against the dictate of green fascism and on opposition to ecologist EU. Despite initial fervor with which he helped organizing the Brotherhood and it’s state, he is more and more frequently asking himself – “do people really appreciate our efforts"?"
POLITICS_LUKASZ_WARZECHA_DESC:0 "Łukasz Warzecha, (born 1975, Łódź), elder of infrastructure and transport of Brotherhood. Before the Fall he worked as journalist in Do Rzeczy magazine, a forge of Brotherhood staff, where he fiercely defended the gasoline cars, and (carbon – based transport machines)   as essential to achieve human compliance and technological progress. He was among the first who answered on Ziemkiewicz's call, together with his followers. Their trucks and SUV-s significantly helped in taking control over Bełchatów area. Through gasoline deficit messed up plans of motorizing the population he now focuses on establishing an efficient, cheap and purely coal – based means of public transport. As more and more steam trams glide across Brotherhood land he is slowly achieving a success."
POLITICS_STANISLAW_JANECKI_DESC:0 "Stanisław Janecki – (born est. 1955) – The grey eminence of the Brotherhood and elder on  intelligence hardy ever talks about his past. If so, he gives contradictory information, making even greater chaos around him. The scraps of data in internet are under successive removing by his resort. Nobody is better than Janecki in closing lips of inquisitive people and other Elders know about it, using his skills in finding and silencing any sign of threat to Brotherhood. But sometimes even they themselves wonder whether they  know who Janecki really is..."
POLITICS_TOMASZ_RZYMKOWSKI_DESC:0 "Tomasz Rzymkowski – (born 13 July, 1986, Kutno) –a paladin and one of the youngest members of Brotherhood elite. After the Fall he made use of his old contacts form National Movement and helped paladin Tomasz Sommer organizing a Brotherhood military forces. It was his idea to establish a value training to the rookies which massively boosted their morale, as defenders of common sense fighting with green scourge. Later he worked as the Black Curator recarbonizing the core curriculum in schools. His closest subordinates are known as the most fanatical in the whole Brotherhood being under his ideological influence."
POLITICS_WITOLD_GADOMSKI_DESC:0 "Witold Gadomski – (born 16 June 1953, Pułtusk) – The Elder on economy is one of the most dubious member of Brotherhood elders. His past activity in „Gazeta Wyborcza”, a liberal newspaper where disastrous ecologist and greenish ideas flourished made him a very unlikely candidate to Brotherhood staff. Surprisingly after he made use of his understatement of economy organization and he swore allegiance to Brotherhood ideas he proved his usefulness and dedication to the cause. Despite his deeply neoliberal beliefs, he accepts a usage of interventionist methods as necessary to ensure victory of Brotherhood and it’s values"
POLITICS_TOMASZ_SOMMER_DESC:0 "Tomasz Sommer (born 16 October 1972, Puławy) – If a foreigner is asking a Bełchatów citizen who is a hero, an ideal man and solider he will without a doubt hear as an answer the name and surname of Paladin-in-chief. It was him who stood against every early thread to the Brotherhood, leading his fellow soldiers to victory after victory. His fierce attacks on Scouts, Hooligans and Dialogue followers often ended with bloody but successful results. Even elder Ziemkiewicz wrote a lot about them giving Sommer a great fame and recognizability. Now, when paladin’s Black Opel Inignia drives along the Bełchatów streets many people are cheering and taking off their caps. Others are silent..."
