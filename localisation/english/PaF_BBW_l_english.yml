We caught them almost red-handed - while they were preparing another bomb in one of their caches in Bełchatów itself. Soon there will be a meeting of the Elder Council that will decide their fate. It still bothers me, what made them do it... We gave them electricity, we kept civilization and developed it, despite the turmoil of war. How could they give up a normal life and… kill these people. Three teenagers, they've barely graduated. Why would they blow up others in cold blood? There is still so much confusion... I don't understand why the investigative team waited until the day of the trial with the announcement of the evidence ... My God, let this madness be finally cleared..."

belchatow.1.t:0 "Trial of the Three"
belchatow.1.desc:0 "The Brotherhood court, located in the small building of the confiscated flyover, was bursting at the seams. The Trial of the Three, as the press loudly wrote about this event, was on the lips of all residents of Bełchatów from the moment when the date of the Trial was announced. In other cities, people listened to CB radios, and the Internet, from where it was still reachable, they waited impatiently for the naext lines of text of the account written by one of the scribes. Some, despite reprimands, brought framed photos of victims to the building. \nWhat happened in the courtroom itself can only be described as pure haos. Despite the instructions and frantic intervensions of the guards, the crowd of viewers still raised angry cheers at the three inconspicous teenagers. Two of them stared impassively at the desk of the accused. The third, the youngest, looked aggressively towards the tribunal and at the onlookers, inciting them to further screams and threats. And so far a few hours until everyone, tired of the procedures, began to listen to the accusations.\nAt least the chief prosecutor - paladin Tomasz Sommer did not take the floor. Summoned by the tribunal, he had difficulty controlling his emotions ny reading the findings of the investigative commision from the sheet of paper. \n-"The accused acted within an organized criminal group describing itself as the "League of Enviromantal Defenders", planning with the help of terror to overthrow the state apparatus and to bring about social changes in the spirit of misuderstood and radical protection of nature..." \nOn the spot, the tribunal was forced to interrupt the hearing and lead the accused and the spectators out. The roar of the word "Death!" bouncing off the walls of the auditorium was overhelming"
