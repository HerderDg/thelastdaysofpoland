BBW_steam_power: "Industrialists without Borders"
BBW_steam_power_desc: ""Industrial technology, forbidden in other countries due to the cries of Ecofascists, shows its virtues and triumphs again. We are one of the last bastions of reason and freedom, which the clutches of the Climatists don’t yet reach. The energy of black gold not only powers the engines of steam trams, power plants, and machinery but also fills our hearts with immense pride. Unfortunately, as a result of years of neglect and ideologically motivated green lobbying, we have been lagging behind our neighbors when it comes to modern mining equipment and technology. With each passing day, however, we get closer to unleashing coal’s true potential. When that time comes, common sense will at last triumph, and the lies of the environmentalists will be revealed for all the world to see.""

BBW_street_anger_desc: "It seems not everybody shares our concept of justice. The Trial of the Three, while fair, has served as a catalyst for the people’s anger, and it seems the terrorists had quite a bit more popular support than we estimated. The streets of Poland’s industrial capital are now littered with cheap environmentalist propaganda, as widespread strikes grind production in our factories to a halt. We are losing control and if we don’t find a way to quell the unrest, the tide of discontent will paralyze the function of our state."
BBW_street_anger2: "Escalating Anger"
BBW_street_anger2_desc: "Due to our inaction, the protests have escalated into a full-blown riot. Instead of seeing our benevolence in letting them run rampant all over our streets, the eco-fascists are now calling for our heads. They label us murderers and soulless polluters, slander the good name of coal, and attempt to overthrow our regime in the name of their fictional green utopia. If we don’t take decisive action soon, the rioters might soon realize their strength and march directly on our positions.

The same people who just a few weeks ago chanted for our death, now hail us as heroes who uncovered the horrific truth of foreign machinations bringing Poland down into its current ruin. With carefully picked scraps of information, we can turn even the worst eco-fascists into upstanding paladins. §RShould they ever discover the depths of our deception, however, the wrath of the betrayed will be impossible to contain.§!"

Their fickle businesses spring out of the ground, only to quickly wither as dreams of fortune fail to materialize. Most of them are nothing more than fools, inept with their finances, they are however fiercely loyal to our cause. As such, we can direct a portion of our surplus right into their pockets. Some within the Brotherhood refer to this subsidy as “an act of socialism”, but this is as pro-business as it gets. After all, the money will find its way back into our hands one way or another, the guaranteed allegiance of the lucky group of newly “self-made” men is merely a bonus."

We caught them almost red-handed - while they were preparing another bomb in one of their caches in Bełchatów itself. Soon there will be a meeting of the Elder Council that will decide their fate. It still bothers me... What made them do it? We gave them electricity, we maintained civilization and we developed it, in spite of the turmoil caused by the war. How could they give up their normal life and... kill these people. Three teenagers, they've barely graduated. Why would they murder others in cold blood? There is still so much confusion...

I tried to cut myself off from all the confusion for a moment by writing a new book, but nothing wants to stick. I just keep walking back and forth. A moment ago, Tomek called, he said that in the city people are still standing in the streets. Among them members of the victims' families were seen dressed in black. I can't sit here forever, but what should I do? If we try to get the situation under control, we will turn out to be soulless as PiS rabble from before the war. No, we can't appear to be like them. One must wait and pray that time will heal all wounds. The guards will be on high alert, but I hope they won't have to leave the barracks. It's over for today.

You know what's waiting right under our noses. The Brotherhood Council meeting is in three hours' time, attendance is mandatory.”\n\nHe hung up after those words. I walked over to the guard and let him know I was going out onto the balcony. The cigarette glow was the only thing that illuminated the area around my dacha. There was a deafening silence all around. Just the murmuring of the sentries in the bushes. I took a drag off my cigarette and smoke filled my lungs. The tension somewhat eased. But I still felt blood pulsing rapidly through my veins. If Łukasz addresses someone by their title in an informal conversation, it means that whatever it is really, really bad\n\n- “Knight Marek!” - I growled at the sentry behind the glass balcony door. – “Get the car ready.

Although they were handcuffed, they threatened that the days of the Brotherhood are numbered, that someone would finally take us on and that the power plants would be all blown up. And the slogans about killing nature... Here's our reward for trying to maintain at least a little bit of normality for the people.

Inside, there will be a large, steel stove from which smoke will rise forever - a symbol of work, transformation and power. Something that will make the miserable explosion of a makeshift bomb look like an infinitely imperfect tracing of... ourselves. An unsurpassed formula.

There is no need to worry about smog or other crap when you can or even have to dig up the guarantee of safety and might from the earth with a shovel. Only a petty man feeds on fear.\n\nDespite the lack of machinery and the need to rely on manual labor, we are on the right track to achieving prosperity. Each strike of the earth will cause an avalanche of more and more, and black gold will flow to our power plants, our homes and abroad for the benefit of us all"\n\nRafał Ziemkiewicz once again looked at the contents of the article he just put together. After a while, he happily grabbed the glass of cognac. He took a deep sip of the amber liquid and grasped his chin thoughtfully over the piece of freshly written paper. "It's good enough," he thought. The standard has been held up."

They don't like us, of course, but they all want lit streets, hot water taps and a working industry. An attack on us would be costly and would result in a loss of supply. Besides, there would be no end to the wars to take control of the power plant. Everyone would like to own it, and this could lead to chaos and destruction of the facility. So we need to sit down at the table and talk. The Bełchatów Railway Station is bursting at the seams with all kinds of materials sent as payment for electricity.

Without steel, it is impossible to successfully extract it, fight other contenders for power or build houses in the place of ruins. Even though we do not have direct iron deposits, scrap metal around us is abundant. It is considered gross by some to recycle, but in fact it is a whole new production cycle. Our new American economics expert, Christian Paulson, believes so.\n\nAfter all, recycling is basically an individual activity, and here a large plant will be responsible for it. If its area formally covers all our dominion, then there will be no question of collecting garbage but only "using scattered warehouses of semi-finished materials"\n\nThat is why it was rightly recognized at the meeting of the Council that building a large steam scrap yard is a historic necessity. The Steam Combine "Citadel" will soon be operational.

Thanks to the money from exports and skilful management, we managed to get the necessary materials. Soon, the narrow stream of energy flowing to the market will turn into a real Yangtze. Chances are our "trading partners" won't be able to resist it.\n\nMoreover, along with the new unit, new plants will be built and those for which there was no capacity before, will be reopened as well. It's wonderful to be rich. Everyone will admit it. And the more wealth the better. Hence the new Council decision to allocate a portion of the money directly to the people. In the end, they deserve it and the money released onto the market will come back to us anyway. As it always should be."

BBW_purchase_of_weapons_desc: "A secret associate of the Brotherhood has just arrived from Łódź. He brought great news about a new deal on the black market. Apparently, one of the smuggling groups got into the old military warehouse. Our associate got a suitcase filled with dollars, a souvenir bag full of dust, and quickly left. The delivery is expected to arrive within a few weeks. Our knights can't wait for something better than 10mm pistols to fall into their hands. The worst ones will go to the new units, we will finally have enough equipment for them."

An insecure society will keep living in fear. There is no other way to go about it. There was nothing new said at the meeting, no groundbreaking or drastic ideas. To its members at least. An ordinary, conformist somebody would've had his hair stand on its ends if he had heard the monotonous, even mechanical conversations about all the monstrosities that the future will bring.\n\nBut first things first. I need to prepare the grounds for the whole operation. I am waiting for a call from the printing house. This premiere will go down in history..."

BBW_wiechowszczyzna_desc: "An earthquake is an understatement. The premiere of my new work was... I don't even know how to describe it. 5,000 books sold out in two hours. The lines stretched for kilometers on end. Everyone is yearning for the truth. Its complex approach. The way it identifies hazards... And the plans it has to do away with them."
BBW_going_to_schools: "Entering the Schools"
BBW_going_to_schools_desc: "Operation "Furnace"\n§R/ŚCIŚLE TAJNE/§!\n\nEveryone knows that schools are a breeding ground for radicals and naive ingrates. Too many students grow out lush curly hairstyles. Bathrooms and cloakrooms hide many materials showing green visions of reality. Without any coal. Without any future. Without the Brotherhood. Fortunately, we've already taught them honest work in advance. At least there will be some use for them when they will be thinking about their own actions. A few days in the coal mines and names will spill out of them in no time."

How ironic that with the use of paper made from trees they spread their message of a green future. Another example of the inconsistencies of the Wiechowszczyzna. We know where this practice is taking place. We know who is handling it. We know who imports waste paper from abroad; from the Scouts in exchange for their badges and points. So why haven't we dealt with it yet?"

BBW_going_into_homes_desc: "Operation "Chimney"\n§R/ŚCIŚLE TAJNE/§!\n\nThe previous selection turned out to be insufficient. Many of the Brotherhood's civilian employees are lazy, even the atmosphere of constant threat from the AK does not help rouse them to work harder and find the Brotherhood’s enemies among their families and friends. Now is the moment to do a solid background check on all of them. If they sit there quiet like a mouse, then they may be up to something."

Despite our efforts in rebuilding the entire area, its inhabitants look at our darkened sky with hatred. If progress is to be secured, we must not passively wait for another explosion of green stupidity. We must act with all the strength that our black wealth has bestowed upon us."
BBW_poor_examples: "Poor Examples from the Woods"
BBW_poor_examples_desc: "Scouts have long been working based on their own opinions. While they have not taken any overt actions to promote their sick ideology, such a fanatical love of forests, their need for only meager supplies (and therefore our profits) of electricity, and the fact that they are the main supplier of paper used for subversive purposes forces us to act. Ultimately, youth detached from logic should have access to the right role models."

They were supposed to destabilize the rapidly developing countries of the West to enable the USSR to win the Cold War. But the West did not give in and triumphed, although today that is all fading away due to the red-green soft-power that has been left to its own devices. There is no doubt that we are experiencing the same exact scenario. After all, they are communists. These eternal troublemakers have earned a wave of purges..."

That thing being a potent poison, savagery and madness joined together into one. Fortunately, our wheels of progress are already present in the lairs of ecological deterioration.\n\nThe Black Cloud of the Brotherhood's will is already descending on the land which was tormented by the rule of vegetative madmen. It will wipe out those Wiechowite cockroaches like the best, ultimate pesticide.

They gave them poor training and made them fit for warfare in a similarly faulty manner. Many of them survived and are in our captivity or are hiding in the forests. It will be a piece of cake to send them to work, and additional soldiers will always come in handy. We will give them a chance for rehabilitation in return for serving in the Brotherhood's auxiliary forces. Ten years in exchange for freedom. They will be provided with basic food, a place to safely store their loot, and access to rabbis-trainers."

We have tolerated his antics for too long. Only the Brotherhood has the rights to the laws of reason.

All references to his bland, left-leaning but eminently Slavic series of books about the playful Geralt disturbingly bringing the country of this overrated writer closer to the fantasy of a fairy-tale kingdom, full of nature, almost unrestrained by human desires, and protecting its wilds, leftist Dryads and Elves who hate progress. Knowing that they are nothing compared to the majestic effort of the human race, which is not afraid of breaking the snobbish conventions of beauty and "decency" - including the ones of climate. The only thing that matters is the strength that the sacred carbon energy brings us. And it is with her help that we will bring order to the North."

Moreover, it looks like anyone from entrepreneurs, workers in the funeral industry and even those working in private emergency services, seem to have power there. Much like our Brotherhood, although we are forced to make some economic interventions to stop decarbonization, ultimately the system that will reign in the world freed from green plague is to be based on the free market and private initiatives of free people, aware of the power of black energy, not constrained by Wiechowite propaganda.

I am convinced that we could use these more down-to-earth monarchists from the writer-duke’s domain to support our efforts. After all, they want hot tap water instead of a prison siphon."

Nobody in the entire former voivodeship exports Wiechism to us, there are no punishments for the destruction of the environment anywhere, and nowhere are there any maggots of retrograde. The next stages of the carbonization of the Brotherhood's lands can now be taken. Soon we will become at least a regional economic powerhouse and we will provide our wards with goods and services which poverty, war and green swindlers forced them to forget..."

BBW_warzecha_report_desc: "Our efforts at unifying the voivodeship’s power grid have turned out to be a farce! Previous reports of our Power Plant being able to sustain the entire region's power usage twofold ended up being just lies and overly optimistic propaganda, undoing months of development and years of future plans. To contain this crisis before it gets completely out of hand, I have tasked Paladin Warzecha with assessing the situation on the ground and figuring out who’s responsible for the falsified documents.\nOne thing is certain, however...\n§RHeads will roll for this§!."
BBW_SYSTEM_OVERLOAD_desc: "I haven’t seen riots this bad since the Trail of Three back in ‘27. This time, however, no matter how tempting the idea sounds, we can’t just blame them on Wiech. No, that would be too far of a stretch at this point. The masses would see through our deception and things would only get worse. I'm sure we'll find a use for this outburst once things have calmed down a bit, but for now, these protests have to be crushed. We need the people back in the mines, back in the factories, and back in their place! ...Or else this Blackout will never go away."
BBW_electricity_stamps_desc: "Rationing electricity... How low will we have to stoop to fix this shortage?\nI’ll need to jump through some pretty painful hoops to rationalize the introduction of stamp cards to the Paladins. After all, most among our upper echelons at the very least grew up when they were first around, creating lifelong resentment towards anything curbing their excess. This may lead to some uncomfortable comparisons, but this is the only solution I can think of that doesn’t require a whole cadre of professionals. Ones that we currently don’t have."
BBW_blow_up_lodz_desc: "The situation is dire and true recovery will take a long time, in the meantime, however, it would be prudent to take our eyes off the matters at hand and redirect our population’s sights toward other issues. Namely, the exclusion zone in Bałuty. Through carefully weaved rhetoric and some... rather large stretches of the imagination, responsibility for the radioactive wasteland can be pinned on the damned Wiechowszczyzna and the puppet masters of Europe in Berlin, stoking further resentment towards our enemies."
BBW_temporary_adepts_desc: "Our security forces are heavily understaffed, there are no questions to be had about that. Following Paladin Rzymkowski’s recommendation, I’ve greenlit a plan to use some of our less egregious dissidents to bolster the ranks of our Adepts. They’ll need some very thorough training to fully clear their minds of any green delusions potentially clouding their rational thinking, but there’s nothing that some strict discipline and punishment can’t achieve. In the coming weeks, they’ll learn more about Common Sense than they’ve done for all their lives thus far... whether they want it or not."
BBW_crisis_staff_desc: "As much as I hate to admit it, an emergency of this magnitude cannot be solved merely through words and preventative half-measures. This situation calls for a well-organized group of experts, led by someone we can fully trust. For that reason, I’ve made the decision to induce Paladin Wróblewski into our inner circle. From now on, he will be the watchful eye presiding over a think tank made up of our brightest scribes, tasked with mitigating the Blackout’s effects. God, I hope they can bring a swift end to this crisis."
BBW_war_for_younger_generations_desc: "Children are naive, there’s no way around it. Their impressionable, little minds are ever susceptible to the vile propaganda spewed by our enemies, muddling their sense of right and wrong. I can only fear what horrible lies they hear about our actions from such naysayers. We need to find a way to ensure that our youths know how to defend their morals and maintain their Common Sense. For that purpose, they will participate in extracurricular, vocational activities that will turn them into exemplary members of the Brotherhood. More difficult work will also be an option for those who really want to prove their worth. In exchange for better grades or some trinket payment, teens will be heavily incentivized to take up work in the mines or receive military training alongside our most loyal men."
BBW_carbonari_association_desc: "Every movement has a youth wing. Why should we be different? There is a well of untapped potential inside every teenager just waiting to be exploited. A recent personal project of mine, the Carbonari Association, will do just that. It will gather all our politically minded youths, putting their bright minds together to help propagate our ideals among their peers. Membership will be entirely voluntary, of course, but what proud parent wouldn’t want their child to be part of such an organization? With all that said, however, there is still one more issue left to be dealt with - the question of leadership. Given the group's nature, I feel I am left with only two options: Roksana Węgiel or Jakub Zgierski. Roksana's popularity would be great for PR, but on the other hand, Jakub's dedication to our ideals is basically unshaken.\n\nI'll really need to think this over, as this choice could prove crucial in determining the organization's direction."
BBW_take_whoever_you_can_desc: "There are hundreds of working-age men out there, pointlessly meandering about and being a dead weight on our economy. Even now, with almost daily power outages, they show no initiative in trying to fix the issue. Do they not know that the Blackout won’t just end by itself? Regardless of what they may think, we’ll need to give them a... helping hand in realizing what’s good for them and the Brotherhood at large. From now on, every person found to be unemployed or working jobs deemed unimportant to the Brotherhood’s goals will be subject to so-called Emergency Shifts at local mines, factories, power plants, and other areas in crucial need of staff. With the additional manpower, we should see our output improving in no time."
BBW_chop_whatever_you_can_desc: "The amount of coal unearthed in Bełchatów is simply not sufficient to maintain our overstrained power grid. While there are many more deposits beneath the Voivodeship’s soil, setting up new mining operations would prove far too costly given our limited resources and unstable situation. What we do have at our disposal, however, are plenty of working men and a wide array of axes and chainsaws to choose from. The conclusion is simple, of course - our workers, voluntary or not, will be sent to gather as much firewood as possible from the enormous forests spanning the region. While not the most efficient energy source out there, it should be enough to keep the power output stable for the moment, or at least so I’ve been told."
BBW_search_wherever_you_can_desc: "Thus far, the measures we’ve put in place to limit power waste have gone largely unenforced. Sure, there were some particularly egregious incidents that any person with even a smidge of Common Sense would spot, but things aren’t always so easy. Now that the Blackout is mostly a non-issue, it’s high time that we do some weeding and find all those who thought themselves too clever to be caught. Anyone suspected of rigging their electricity usage counters or possessing more fuel than they were allotted will face justice for sabotaging the Brotherhood.\n\nAdditionally, Paladin Janecki suggested that this could also serve as a great way for the Carbonari to prove themselves. Acting as our own eyes and ears on the ground, they’ll get rewarded for reporting anyone they think might be bending the rules.\n They might end up needing slightly sanitized explanations for what happens to those they turn over, however..."
BBW_voice_of_the_brotherhood_desc: "My booming voice thunders all over the Brotherhood's official broadcasts as all our grateful, loyal citizens turn on their makeshift speakers and radios to hear their leader speak. With a great deal of pride, I declare a remarkable triumph - the hope-draining blackouts have been dealt with, banished only to the people's collective memory of what life would look like without us. The forced corvée servitude, massive deforestation, and emergency shifts were all worth it, as finally, everyone can enjoy power without any interruption. But even though we celebrate today, we still have a long way to go before Common Sense can truly become common."
BBW_protocols_of_atomic_crusade_desc: "I am a prolific writer, a talent I use to its full extent in a noble effort to lay down my truth upon the Brotherhood and expose those who would rather see me fail. It seems it is time to once again use my skills for our collective good. In the 'Protocols of the Atomic Crusade', I shall warn the people of a dangerous Wiechowite conspiracy threatening to destroy everything we have built. I will show everyone its past efforts of infiltrating and overthrowing the Polish government, even pushing the Germans to invade our soil, and I will expose its current preparations for a nuclear-powered crusade and its goal to purge the Brotherhood, Europe, and then the world in atomic hellfire. I will write to get the word out and change the hearts and minds of our citizens. Again, again, and again, until no other truth can even be considered."
BBW_green_faction_desc: "How can we be sure that our people are truly loyal to us? That they won’t stab us in the back at the nearest opportunity? How do we know that they’re not making more bombs in their basements or attics? It’s easy to ignore rogue elements, just smile and wave as we lose more great minds like Sommer. If we don’t take the initiative in our battle against those green bastards, then we’re just inevitably setting ourselves up for failure. I’ll notify Paladin Rzymkowski that it’s time again to sweep out any eco-fascists that might be hiding amongst our working population. These traitors will face the only punishment they deserve – death."
BBW_achievements_desc: "The blackouts, the dissidents, the constant threat of totalitarian control... all of that is proof that you just can't create a common-sense society without thoroughly deprogramming the ideological malaise that befell our nation. We stood on the edge of doom, our state dying under blackouts and waves of unrest. And yet, we refused to break. The challenge and the sacrifice only strengthened our resolve. To become masters of infrastructure and industry. To redefine the methods of social control. To affirm the Brotherhood as the last hope for this country and this planet."
BBW_official_initation_of_adepts_desc: "Upon their arrival, our recruits were an undisciplined, disorganized group lacking any real purpose. However, thanks to our rigorous education, and ruthless drills, we have honed the strength of their minds with every scream, every punishment, until they were no longer boys, but men, ready to swear their oaths and stand together with us as warriors of Common Sense. Once the words are spoken, their fate is sealed. We are defined by our choices. Their decision to come here, to utter the oaths, all culminate in the choice to become a part of the Brotherhood. They better make us proud."
BBW_new_brotherhood_spokesman_desc: "As the Brotherhood grows, so too do its needs. Soon, the ever-increasing administrative burden will become too much to handle alone. My focus must remain singular, with no room for miscalculations and disturbances for our greater goals. Therefore, the day-to-day operations of our state will have to be entrusted to my soon-to-be-appointed spokesman. There are only two candidates who remotely fit such a dignified position, and curiously, they both absolutely despise each other. Well, I guess it's time to take sides."
BBW_stabilization_of_energy_grid_desc: "We can no longer tolerate having to shut off power for the majority of the day. Are we some sort of ecofascists to restrict people's access to electricity? No, from now on, our top priority will be the constant expansion of the Bełchatów plant! I don't care what it takes, it must provide for the entire region. Much work has already been done, so it shouldn't be long before we expand its output enough to match the greed of our energy grid."
BBW_a_curious_find_desc: "The city of Łódź, once shrouded in the dark, shines once more. You could see it from miles away, the beautiful glow resulting from Warzecha's efforts and the work of its denizens... had it not been covered by layers of smog. But the faint hue visible behind its dark coating is much fairer on the eyes than its light gleaming through a clear sky. The two-fold sign of progress - carbon dioxide blessing the air and electric power blessing the ground. I can finally relax and commence my flight over the city and relish in the light show below. I shall fly low enough to see all the signs of Łódź's restoration and to ensure the sleepless citizens know I was (and am) above them."
BBW_moment_of_peace_desc: "Our efforts were nothing less than a resounding success. We rose to the occasion and met the challenges of infrastructure, energy, and discontent that broke all the lesser men who came before us. Our calling has been justified and our power has been entrenched. And now, our truth, too, reigns supreme. Thanks to our diligent workers, the factories and power plants reach previously unseen levels of productivity, and the people, shrouded in smog, are finally at peace. Nothing can stop us now, and so I will return to my dacha, where I can resume my grand design for the Brotherhood's future."
BBW_our_inspiration_desc: "We are finally ready to intensify our efforts and strengthen the ties that bind our Brotherhood, and of course, the responsibility for ensuring this falls on me. Ever since our state's foundation, the people who put their trust in us have been threatened by subversive elements and foreign operatives, and I have no doubt that now we must go further than ever before to protect them. Our industrial utopia cannot be achieved if we don't pursue greater unity as a nation. If the Brotherhood is to truly live up to its name, our brothers need to be prepared for the challenges ahead. They look up to me for guidance, and so I too need to be ready, cast all doubt aside, and charm them with visions of our brighter future. Together we will achieve greatness."

BBW_lungs_full_of_hope_desc: ""

BBW_factory_scribes_desc: "Advanced production methods require expertise. Sure, we could always throw endless waves of manpower and resources at the problem in the foolish hope that it ends up fixing itself, but without engineers, logisticians, trained chemists, and many other experts, we might end up like those primitive scouts - trying to build an economy with slings and pinecones. We are a sophisticated Brotherhood with plenty of members with enough know-how to train and manage the next generation of industrial experts. They will finally ensure us a worthwhile output."
BBW_tube_terminals_desc: "Globalization and its consequences were truly just a cascade of stupidity and a disaster for all production. A single factory in Belgium, or some third-world hellhole, being an all-or-nothing node in the worldwide semiconductor industry? Such a fragile little thing, this globalist economy. Fortunately for us, we have the know-how and frugality to revert to more manageable vacuum tube computers. They should have more than enough computing power to sustain all our current needs and, more importantly, can be made without imports of any kind. Never again will we be at the mercy of foreign interests."
BBW_initial_start_desc: "We're not moving forward fast enough. Yes, we're on schedule, but the schedule completely underestimated the significance of national developments, let alone international ones. Luckily, I have a plan to counteract this issue - a twelve-hour workday. We'll refunnel as much personnel as possible to construction crews, which will work round the clock on two separate shifts. This way we can accelerate the building of our most vital projects. The workers won't be able to stand it for long, but the measure will only be temporary - just a brief sprint to catch up with the world in the one way that matters."
BBW_private_investitions_desc: "Having created the Brotherhood as the last remaining aegis of Common Sense, it was inevitable that the entrepreneurial spirit within would manifest. With our position solidified, many of our members have now chosen to invest their money in various economic ventures. And among the bloom of private capital, an intriguing new class has taken root - foreign investors. Inspired by our image as ideological pioneers and safe haven for capitalist policies, these daredevil small business owners seek deals in places where few dare tread. Not one to persecute a lemonade stand with a lawbook, I welcome their contribution to our growing economy. My scribes shall take good care of them, seeing what's worth learning and what's worth trading."
BBW_full_speed_production_desc: "Did I say anything about the twelve-hour shifts being temporary? Well, if you claim I did, you are clearly just spreading subversive propaganda and need to be removed. No, we have to make the most of our factories, and since we don't have the manpower to do three shifts of eight hours each, we WILL settle for a 12-hour workday, and we WILL be happy about it! Shorter shifts were warranted when dissenters were banging at our door, but now that my power is unquestioned, the Brotherhood will get its prosperity and YOU WILL NOT COMPLAIN! Do you think I work eight hours a day? Why should you be different?"
BBW_american_licenses_desc: "The progress we’ve made to solidify our presence has allowed us to secure deals never before dreamed of. Thus far, the apparently uncertain internal situation and lack of any international recognition have successfully prevented companies from even daring to open negotiations with us. Supposedly, any kind of monetary investment would prove “too risky” and “bad for their image”. In truth, they're just cowards, afraid of real progress. But now that our victory looms ever closer and our superiority over the other warlords is clear, we've managed to set up talks with representatives of certain decently large American corporations sympathetic to our cause. Though they mostly remain unsure for now, we've managed to procure licenses from a handful of mainly electronics and agricultural enterprises. Hopefully, we could find a way to utilize them in one way or another."
BBW_district_bunkers_desc: "The Wiechowszczyzna - a threat not just from within, but also without. Their grimy, atomic, sludge-ridden tendrils spread far and wide, corrupting everyone to fear, hate and despise us. Though coal's superiority is obvious and unquestionable, we can't just rest on our laurels as those fanatics gather their strength. We need to be ready for their every strike, and so too must our population. After all, what if the worst truly came to pass? Therefore, to ensure the people's safety, I’ve approved an initiative to fortify every major city and regional capital within the Brotherhood with an impressive array of underground bunkers that could save thousands in case of an attack from the brainwashed masses and their Atomic puppetmasters."

BBW_city_adjustment_desc: "Paladin Gadomski's ideas get weirder and weirder by the day. In our pursuit of new coal veins to feed our constantly growing industry, we have discovered a great deal of resources located below already-inhabited areas. Cities, villages, hell, even single disheveled shacks in the middle of the woods. For now, we've had the comfort to ignore them and simply look elsewhere, but as the pool of untapped coal grows increasingly scarce, well, we have a bit of a problem. According to Gadomski, the best course of action would be to forcefully relocate the citizens of said settlements to the metropolises of Bełchatów and Łódź. Personally, I find this idea ridiculous and headache-inducing just to think about. That’s not even poking a beehive, it’s like smashing it with a sledgehammer while clutching the queen bee! \n\nRegardless, the measure will be put to a vote. I just hope Gadomski knows what he's doing."
BBW_organised_logging_desc: "We cannot hope to achieve sufficient production unless we are ready to make sacrifices - that much is clear. Thanks to the efforts undertaken by me and the council, the Brotherhood is more than ready for these sacrifices, but in order for them to bear fruit, we must somehow achieve greater efficiency. I have no illusions about the problems of our current production - we do not have enough fuel as is, and our methods are not streamlined enough. Mining simply won't suffice on its own, at least for now. We can rely on wood to make up for the deficit, but we have to turn our current procurement efforts into a full-on organized, state-managed system. It's time to get logging."
BBW_energetic_stability_desc: "As an organization focused primarily on generating power and mining operations, the Brotherhood always thoroughly pondered the challenge of restoring the devastated energy grid. Modern mining techniques require significant amounts of power, but even the most efficient grids experience heavy energy losses during transmission. To address this, we have devised a rather ingenious solution. Minor power plants will be assigned to every village and production site, allowing us to fully utilize the generated output and reduce the costs associated with rebuilding the energy grid."
BBW_underground_mine_belchatow_desc: "Some things never change. The situation within the Brotherhood and even more so outside its borders may be ever-fleeting, but one thing always stays the same - we drill wherever there is coal to be found. For every surface deposit, there are many more hidden deep underground. Once surveyed, all that's left to do is use the machinery at our disposal to dig a network of tunnels, with each of these tendrils advancing against rock and stone, siphoning the precious coal right into our grasp."
BBW_district_mine_rogow_desc: "The otherwise unremarkable hamlet of Rogów is about to receive a boost in employment and population that rivals what even a gold rush can provide. Of course, unlike the real thing, our gold has been out of demand for quite a while now due to the cries of industry-hating liberals, but all of that will change. Coal and energy production will inevitably cause home workshops and later dedicated factories to spring up. But what's with all the complaints about our plans overlapping with some kind of local... arboretum? Surely the people will do just fine without their pretentious little trees."
BBW_internal_migration_desc: "With our new investments soon to be up and running, it is time to face the grim and unwanted truth - our grand projects will require some sacrifices to complete. The mines are our greatest source of pride, but obviously, building them will require the... relocation of some unfortunate few. I know this may be difficult for the people of Rogów, Główno, and Rogożno, but they must do their part for the good of the Brotherhood. We will have them move to other cities as we prepare to convert their towns into mining posts. "
BBW_surface_mines_glowno_rogozno_desc: "Ahh, the Głowno-Rogożno surface mine. Truly a sight to behold. So large that it dwarfs both its namesake towns combined and then some. A neverending maze of man-made hills and stone valleys, all centering around a colossal gaping maw in which uncountable heaps of coal await their extraction. There is so much to be done, so much black gold to dig up. But with enough power and our state-of-the-art machinery, even this mine can eventually be tamed."

BBW_fast_is_good_desc: "Our mission is still far from completion, leaving us with only limited resources. Therefore, we must think twice before we dedicate ourselves to building truly impressive machines, especially main battle tanks. I have tried working it into our budget, but the plans will have to be put off, at least for now. I hope that one day we may dust them off and turn them into reality, but for now, we must improvise, we must adapt, and we must overcome. And it seems to me that this can only be achieved through the mass production of lighter armored vehicles. They are much faster than tanks, and more importantly, much cheaper. This will allow us to reinforce our cause with state-of-the-art armored warfare without losing all of our funds on costly, sluggish tanks."
BBW_harder_is_better_desc: "As the Brotherhood's leading figure, I am responsible for protecting my people. In the face of a severe threat from neighboring warlords, we cannot hold back when it comes to strengthening our military might. When riding into battle, our brave soldiers must be accompanied by awe-inspiring steel beasts. I didn't have to think long when it comes to finding the best candidate to fill this role. Only one vehicle stands above all others as the king of mobile warfare - the heavy tank. Ever since World War 2 it has been the deciding factor of many-a-battle, always striking fear into the hearts of those in its way. The production of these killer machines will cost us greatly, but it is something necessary for us to succeed. We cannot compromise on our path forward. Our military must be the strongest in Poland."
BBW_paladin_tomasz_sommer_zpw_desc: "Dedication. Strength. Sacrifice. These three virtues of the Brotherhood are exemplified perfectly in the figure of the late Paladin Tomasz Sommer. It is our duty to honor him, and in doing so, encourage the rest of us to reach his heights. Though our budget remains strapped, it just so happens that we can afford the construction of a much-needed small arms factory. Every rifle forged inside it shall bear his name and discharge the Brotherhood's justice exactly the way our hero would have willed."

BBW_cham21_desc: "Artillery is often regarded as the cruel God of War, as every reputable strategy handbook will remind you. And when it comes to explosive shells, the rule is - the bigger the better. Why pelt the enemy with tiny pellets when we can blast them into oblivion with one giant shell? For this exact purpose, we have created the colossal Saint Barbara cannon, an awe-inspiring tube of steel boasting a caliber of nearly an entire meter. Now, our enemies will tremble in fear even when hidden behind their fortifications, while the sight of this behemoth will inspire our troops and engineers alike."
BBW_zgred37_desc: "Tanks have always raced to become tougher and stronger. The Ukraine War showcased the unmatched power of American tanks, which consistently defeated their faster, but less armored Russian counterparts. Our industrial ingenuity can be expected to deliver nothing but the hardest armor and most powerful arms. The Koala tank will exemplify this perfectly. How thick must the armor be? Thicker. How many cannons? Yes. Finding a suitable engine for this beast? Eh, I leave that for my engineers to figure out, that's why they're called engineers after all. Can it stand up to modern anti-tank rocketry? Well, our enemies couldn't possibly hope to get their hands on any, so it doesn't even matter."
BBW_armored_roller_grace_desc: "A disciplined, well-commanded battlegroup is like an orchestra and a ballet combined. With all the grace of nearly hundred-ton machines and the subtlety of a 50cm cannonade, we shall turn the battlefield into our own symphony. Our speed and organization will be so impeccable that the enemy will have no choice but to break and kneel in applause before our violins, bass, guns, and cannons. We shall dance an armored waltz around them, and as the earth thunders, they will bow before us with minimal resistance."
BBW_modern_plating_desc: "As disappointing as it may sound to the dreamers within our ranks, I've made the decision to keep our efforts at improving our armor technology within the boundaries of modern conventions. While the idea of sending our soldiers into battle clad in mighty power armor may be tempting, the risk of it all going wrong is too high and the costs of actually researching and developing such a project are too heavy. We have enough funds and industry to simply outclass our rivals as it is, and if exploring new frontiers can doom us, we're better off not chasing impossible dreams. After all, if we are to stay true to our cause of defending Common Sense and being the much-needed voice of reason, we cannot bet everything on wishful thinking and fantasies."
BBW_dissemination_of_bulletproof_vests_desc: "Our manufacturing efforts have been very expensive, but the most expensive resources out there is still manpower. As such, we need to focus on preventing as many casualties as possible before we think of cutting our spending on procurement and production. The bulletproof vest is a commonly used equipment and although it won’t always save a life, it can do a lot to protect a soldier’s vitals. The experienced soldier knows when he can afford to take a risk, and so being equipped with a vest will greatly aid him in his efforts. If we want a professional army, we must be ready to provide our troopers with the equipment they need to demonstrate their prowess on the battlefield."
BBW_most_modern_plating_desc: "The time has come for some true innovation. Many have doubted us. Even our brothers said it can't be done. They claimed it couldn't possibly work, that the cost would be too great to be worth the risk. But they're all wrong. What they fail to see is that ordinary armor technology is a limitation – one that we cannot accept if we are to remain on our road to progress. Instead, we'll craft a masterpiece of engineering that will force our enemies to respect and fear us - the Brotherhood's first generation of power armor. No matter how much we have to spend, the investment will be worth it in the end. If our fight is to result in victory, we must go beyond what is thought to be possible and reach out toward greatness."

BBW_knights_of_progress_desc: "Over time, I’ve started to notice a change in the attitude of our junior members. The idea of donning a suit of armour and charging into battle to fight for progress appeals to the young adepts more than ever. I am hoping this is a result of something more than just being swayed by propaganda. It seems possible, even probable, that they truly believe in the innovative warfare we seek to promote. This sentiment will undoubtedly lead to a raise in their morale, something we greatly desire. After all, it is one of the few things that cannot be achieved with sufficient profit and enough R&D work."

BBW_internal_peace_desc: "I always believed in victory, but now it seems the measure of our success is greater than I expected it to be. In our zealous fight against climate disinformation and the stubborn resistance of non-believers, we have finally achieved stability. The majority of dissidents have been silenced or made irrelevant. But that’s not the only thing we’ve done. I’m proud to say we have finally managed to bring the flow of information under our control. It is no longer disrupted by those seeking to undermine our work and ideological nay-sayers, the green league is a distant memory, and we’re constantly on the road to full success. Oh, how wonderful it will be – I can already imagine the world as it will be after we complete our mission. I won’t let anyone stop me, because we aren’t stopping now."
BBW_press_freedom_institute_desc: "Too many media outlets in Poland have been poisoned with falsehoods inspired by the great climate panic. All across the country people are “independently” segregating their waste, driving electric cars, advocating for the closure of coal mines, and other such nonsense. But not here. We believe in the power of coal, traditional energy, and the old way of life. And I want to keep it that way, starting with newspapers. To free our press from corruption, we need a Press Freedom Institute. The institute will monitor all press published on our territory to make sure it’s free of any climatist lies. Janecki can handle the job, and I’m sure he’d be willing to make sure all available sources of information stick to reporting the truth, and only the truth."
BBW_climatology_institute_desc: "So-called climatologists have been a constant and impossible to ignore thorn in our side for a long time now. We will defend ourselves by continuing to silence their seductive voices and protect the populace from their lies, but that can only take us so far. I believe it’s high time to start our counter-attack. As such, I have decided to sponsor the creation of a climatology institute of our own under my name. It will provide more curious citizens with all the knowledge on the topic they will ever need. Of course, the reports will primarily be based on my work, making them very different from those published by other such institutes, but that is precisely what we need – an alternative to all of that eco-terrorist whining."
BBW_brotherhood_u_desc: "Our efforts are ceaselessly focused on the future, and in order to not undermine them, we must not neglect proper education. Industry is still the top priority, but we should at least provide some higher education to keep our society cultured and intelligent, as opposed to the savages still living among the undeveloped ruins of old Poland outside our orders. The founding of an official Brotherhood University with branches in Łódź and Bełchatów is the first step to building an enlightened nation. The Brotherhood’s respected senior members can act as lecturers in these schools and prepare our young generation for becoming the future elite of this country. At first, self-styled intellectuals will scoff at our noble university, but in time it will become a prestigious school like no other, and they will not be laughing then."

BBW_one_paper_desc: "For a long time now, I've had a feeling that we aren't truly utilizing the potential of the 'Do Rzeczy' newspaper. Though it lies firmly under our control and we've already used it many times to spread our truth to the wider public, there's always been a crucial piece missing - a leading figure to truly turn the paper into a propaganda machine. Luckily, I know just the right man for the job. If we can get Paweł Lisicki back at the helm, 'Do Rzeczy' can once again return to its highest standards of journalistic quality and ideological purity. If there is anyone whom I can trust to dutifully and expertly redact the sole newspaper of our blossoming society, it's him. Surely he won't have to think twice before accepting our offer."
BBW_semblance_of_discussion_desc: "If we want to enjoy a greater deal of popular support, we have to make sure our citizens don't lose trust in the government. And if we can prove that our officials are capable of engaging in a peaceful debate – and winning it, of course - we will surely be more trusted. I believe it would be a perfect opportunity if Warzecha were to prove his rhetorical skill by disproving some climatist arguments in a public broadcast. I have complete faith in his abilities, but the plan does come with a lot of issues. Firstly, our unrelenting crackdown on the atomic crusade and other eco-terrorists makes it difficult to find any dissident actually willing to cooperate and sit down with us. Furthermore, we can't afford of single slip-up in a live televised debate, and mistakes do happen, even to the best of us. As such, we will need to get creative and conjure up some opponents for our champion, even if that requires enlisting some actors and a bit of off-screen scriptwriting. That way we can send the right message without risking a potential failure."
BBW_one_vision_desc: "My books already form an important part of the Brotherhood's culture, greatly influencing the views of our people. In many ways, they are true national epics and treasure troves of philosophy from which everyone can draw values and beliefs. And now, we finally have a newspaper that keeps the common folk informed and reminds them of our glory. With such wealth of Common Sense material, I keep asking myself - why would we have them read anything else? I have learned my lessons from our humble beginnings and clashes with eco-fanatics. Without government sanction, literature always carries the risk of poisoning people's minds with propaganda and vile lies aiming to discredit the carbon cause. We can't allow that to happen. My books and Do Rzeczy will be the sole guiding lights in the ideological sphere of the Brotherhood."
BBW_full_shafts_desc: "Our recent debates between Warzecha and his 'adversaries' has led me to a rather concerning realization. There is still a surprisingly large opposition to our government's policies within the country. They hide in the shadows and avoid any contact with our institutions and peacekeepers, fully aware of our lack of tolerance for their rotten beliefs. But if we are to remain a strong and unified society, we must pull those weeds out at every opportunity, not just wait for them to grow too large to be ignored. We will hunt down all enemies of the state, and make sure they are never heard from again! It will be a massive undertaking and I have no clue just how many dissidents we'll find, but I'm sure the mining shafts will serve as perfect grounds for their mass burials. Hopefully, they don't overfill."

BBW_regionalisation_of_brotherhood_desc: "Back to back success and back to back triumph. Our territories multiply in mere months, and our efforts in integrating new conquest have to keep up. No longer capable of maintaining the hyper-unitary organization of ours, we must develop a regional division of government, capable of being replicated to control new lands at will, and bind them to my will. This new division will also be responsible for recruitment, ensuring new blood keeps flowing in the Brotherhood itself. With Warzecha's methods and my meticulousness, they will soon run like clockwork."
BBW_even_angry_desc: "Alea iacta est. The die is cast. But this time I'm not crossing a river: I'm delegating Roxi to solve our chronic manpower shortage by initiating people Warzecha or I would consider... unworthy. Revisionist. Fifth Columnist. I keep thinking of Dr Faust, but if it means thinking less about how few recruits the Brotherhood is getting, so be it."
BBW_most_obedient_desc: "We are forced to open our doors towards people that our members can't quite vouch to be... reasonable. But that's what the common sense academy is for: We will streamline its processes and education to be even more intense and pervasive, such that obedience and ideological integrity will be assured. We had to thin down our engineering and research departments to deliver more expert-level minds for the academy, but the growth of our movement will make it more than worth it."
BBW_adaptation_of_factories_desc: "Typically, every new factory is exalted and augmented to be as energy-consuming and potent as possible, assuring the quality of its production at expense of additional energy and wasted materials. But our conquests mean that we can't keep up with such upgrades of newly acquired factories. We can't end up considering issues like energy shortages and material shortfalls, not ever again. And so, as any good boss will tell his employees... we must make do with less.  And that's the direction for most of our factories, moving onward."
BBW_humility_desc: "We haven't even finished fully initiating new members, and already our mess halls and corridors are contaminated with back to back revisionism. A worry about how long will our ores last here, a fear there, fear, fear everywhere, disguised as humility! A single misstep, a single instance of relenting, and already it cascades into abandoning of common sense! At the heart of it all, Roxi sits, trying my patience, holding her little lectures in underbellies of our lands, as if I'm not listening..."
BBW_full_remodeling_desc: "Now that the education of our new recruits is going smoothly again, we can relegate our most ideologically sound personnel to revise our new factories to conform to our standards. Standards of consumption. They must never be concerned with weak-minded concepts like not wasting anything. No expense can be spared in the holy task of production. And every new factory needs a supervisor that understands it in same exact way that I do."
BBW_pride_desc: "This Roxi has been a thorn in our side for quite long enough. Not a single doubt, not a single seed of heresy or fear can be allowed to spread. And she, alas, is at an epicenter of it all. Fear denies faith, which in turn denies our momentum. Without momentum, the Brotherhood is nothing. But by my command, and Warzecha's act, Roxi instead will be nothing. Anytime she holds her little lecture, I want an incident. A fight, ventillation breakdown, I don't care. Silence her. And anyone else who doubts, fears, or otherwise slows us down."
BBW_future_or_fall_desc: "My newspaper, my Brotherhood, all that is mine... none of this was meant as a debate club. But debating is everything we do here now. If these shouting matches, these fights, this *revisionism* can even be called debates! I would deal with this, if not for the fact that same disorder is spreading in the countryside: We're receiving reports about an impending economic breakdown, i don't remember what's the issue exactly anymore, but I know why. The Brotherhood is like an engine. It needs dedication as fuel and certainty as oxidizer to keep combustion that drives us to progress going. With doubt festering, small wonder the whole machine breaks down! We can only ride forward unto future, or fall by breaking down in place. There is no middle ground. "
BBW_impulse_desc: "I remember when we were dealing with a blackout. The situation was arguably worse than it is today, but we were together, confident, and obedient. With my direction, we rose to the occasion and forged an unsurpassed power grid to deliver us from blackout. Now we're too far. Too wide. Too fearful. The more we doubt, the less we act, the more we argue, the worse it gets. An impulse is needed. Like a slap on the face that ends all dissent and discussion once and for all. But good luck slapping sense into this entire Brotherhood at once..."
BBW_overcrowded_hospitals_desc: "Hospitals are filled with the sick. Everyone reports respiratory issues, and the doctors actually believe them! The doubt in our ideals seeped into our healthcare and now the doctors insist our lungs are polluted! Hah! This is worse than Roxi: It's the Atomic Crusade. It's clear as day they introduced Covid-19 to our midst again and blame it on our so-called pollution of air! I should purge our whole healthcare system, but even I am infected. Not with covid... with doubt. I saw ash-covered dead in hospitals. I personally oversaw their autopsy. Not a trace of a coronavirus on these bodies..."
BBW_insecurity_desc: "We're back in the 1980s. Shelfs in markets are empty. My best men have shook up our farms and purged them from doubt and laziness: They report sickly livestock and back to back crop failures. They dared not tell me why. Small vicotry in the sea of defeats. Defeat of faith in the system, of everyone but me. Yes, everyone. Otherwise if a single person packed up their shit and left their mining settlement, they'd be shot. But no one was. And now thousands are trekking across our lands. They should be secure in righteousness of our cause. But there's no confidence at all..."

One single miscalculations, one single misstep and underestimation and suddenly, all soldiers in posts that matter most turn on us, on the Brotherhood, on the common sense. I was the first to run for my life: Others are either 'retired' or worse, I'm getting reports of loyal military units getting neutralized one by one! It all returns to nothing. It all comes tumbling down. Whatever follows will be its antithesis. All that's left to me... is to hide. This Choroszcz insane asylum seems like a perfect place where I can safely lose my mind, as this place loses the Brotherhood."
BBW_clean_farming_zones_desc: "Not a moment has passed since the revisionists made themselves comfortable, and already the most heretical strains of thinking prevail upon us. The insane notion that the sacred factory exhausts are a disaster for nature (or that it should even matter if they are), gives its first rotten fruits: Relocating industries away from agricultural centers to assure their productivity. Are they really this daft?! What happened to just throwing more phosphorus at the soil?!!"
BBW_strategic_diversification_desc: "Now I have to admit, even in my mind, the question about running out of coal someday, lingered. I tried dispelling that heresy, but it's true after all: Someday we'd run out of coal. I even had scientists investigate into methods to circumvent that problem, and it seems Roxi got a wind of that team and put them to use. But how will that pan out... and if there's any place left for Brotherhood as I envisioned for it... I don't know. I don't care. Let me rest. This whole ordeal... Dr Szper insists I have several different disorders. Perhaps I exaggarated my state of mind a bit too well."

Well pray tell me this, Roxi: If THAT counts as coal, then what doesn't? There's more materials containing carbon than those that aren’t. We're made of carbon! That's right, YOU count as coal. What's next, eh? Immolating people as energy source? If this madness goes on, I'm sure that's what they'll end up doing. Biogas. I guess you can't run out of it. There's method to the madness there... but it's still justified by fear and revisionism."
BBW_filters_for_power_plants_desc: "As expected of revisionist filth, Roxi's initiative is dedicated to wasting time as ever. Using filters for our divine power plants, gaining us miniscule amounts of carbon instead of letting it enshroud us. But, and it does make me feel go insane: The contacts i made to keep tabs on the siutaion swear to me the hospitals receive less and less patients. All without a single plague precaution... perhaps I should reconsider what really happened to our lungs."

belchatow.1.t: "Trial of Three"
belchatow.1.desc: "The Brotherhood Court, a room situated in the small building of the confiscated Estakada Mall, was bursting at the seams. The "Trial of Three", as the press vibrantly wrote about this event, was on the lips of all residents of Bełchatów from the moment the date of the hearing was announced. In other cities, people listened intently to their CB radios, and where the Internet was still up and running, they waited impatiently for the next lines of the transcript written meticulously by one of the scribes.\n\nDespite protest, some brought framed photos of the attack’s victims to the court. What happened in the very courtroom can only be described as pure chaos. Despite the instructions and frantic interventions of the guards, the crowd of spectators still raised angry jeers at the three inconspicuous teenagers. Two of them stared dispassionately at the accused’s desk.The third and youngest one, was staring aggressively towards the tribunal and at the onlookers every now and then, inciting further screams and threats. And so it went on like that for several hours, until everyone, simply tired of the procedures, began to listen to the accusations.\n\n At least until the chief prosecutor - High Paladin Tomasz Sommer - took the floor. Summoned by the tribunal, he had great difficulty controlling his emotions while reading the findings of the investigation committee.\n- "The accused acted as part of an organized criminal group describing themselves as the "League of Environmental Defenders", planning, by means of terror, to overthrow the state apparatus and to bring about social changes in the spirit of misunderstood and radical nature protection..."\nWhen he was seated after a while, the tribunal was forced to interrupt the hearing and lead the accused and the spectators out. The roar of the word "DEATH!" reverberating within the walls of the auditorium was overwhelming."

belchatow.2.t: "Bloody Saturday"
belchatow.2.desc: "11:39 - High Paladin Tomasz Sommer returns from his visit to The Power Plant and gets off with a guard from his service Opel Insignia in front of the Brotherhood's Headquarters, the former city hall. Suddenly a young woman approaches him briskly, the security staff is too slow to react. A shot is fired from a pistol. The girl was the daughter of one of the members of the guard. High Paladin Tomasz Sommer gets shot in the heart and is pronounced dead on his way to the hospital at 1:46 pm. The assassin was immediately apprehended. \n\n13:49 - Information about the attack spreads at an astonishing pace. Social outrage leads to crowds of people taking to the streets in solidarity with the Brotherhood. \n\n13:57 - After hearing about the attack on Sommer from a smuggled radio, prisoners lynch the accused from the "Trial of Three". The prison guards only react after a long while. Two of the inmates are killed, the third arrives in the prison infirmary severely wounded. At 2:23 am the next day he is escorted to hospital and put into an induced coma.\n\n 14:03 - A spontaneous demonstration reaches the headquarters of the Brotherhood. Several thousand people are demanding the assurance of security and immediate punishment for the guilty girl and all the others."

belchatow.3.t: "Monument of Discord"
belchatow.3.desc: "Tadek, a newly minted adept of the Brotherhood, found out that he had been stationed at the ceremony of unveiling some monument the day before the event itself. He wasn’t very thrilled about it, because he had leave scheduled at that time and had plans to go out drinking with the other novices. "There is no way out, only you are available right now, I will not be recalling those dogs from outside the city" the voice of the Sergeant Knight thundered in his head. Oh well, I have to pull myself together, put a rifle on my shoulder, a plate on my chest and keep order on the steam tram going from Wola Mikorska to Steel Park - the former Olszewski Park, where the composition of sculptures that was the source of the problem was to stand.\n\nTadek didn't really care why they put it there, who they were supposed to be based off of, etc. They didn't pay him for being interested. But he could tell something was up in the air. In the tram, only the sounds of the boiler interrupted the deafening silence. The people dressed in black did not even look out of the windows at the landscape, which was shrouded by smog. Tadek was afraid to talk to anyone. Even the Chief Knight who looked like a good bloke.\n\nWhen they got there, everyone saw a huge, several meters tall... block. From a speech by some balding bighead, Tadek learned that the sculpture is dedicated to those who died in an attack from a few months ago and the newest victim of  "The Green Terror" - Head Paladin Sommer. The great cauldron in the center of the monument obscured the blue sky with thick, black clouds.\n\nThe young adept felt in his bones that people were clearly moved by the whole matter. They were silent until the very end, even during the ride back. In the evening, Tadek, already off duty, relaxed with the desired beer and thought..."
belchatow.3.a: "I think this is gonna be my last one for a long while... Fucking hell..."

belchatow.4.t: "An Uneasy Council"
belchatow.4.desc: "The entire Brotherhood council, made up of a dozen or so people, was despite the late hour, debating the newly obtained evidence with incredible vigor. These were letters full of particularly disturbing information. Finally, the chaotic discussion gave way to order, when the Scribe Stefan Janecki slammed his fist down onto the table so hard that a pile of old rubber boots collapsed near the tiled stove in the corner of the room. The guards frantically began putting it back together.\n\n- Dear Brothers, I don't think we have any doubts that this green plague is stronger than anyone might have previously suspected. By our lack of attention, we raised a bunch of ingrates and dreamers who, through their stupidity, can bring us all doom. A generation of parasites...\n\nSenior Paladin Witold Gadomski - Head of the Ministry of Economy, immediately raised his hand.\n\n- Exactly so! We have failed, we have handed over the younger generation and some of the old to eco-terrorists and climate liars! How did Wiech's writings reach the people?! We've slept well for way too long and now we're going to bear the consequences. The attacks so far are only the beginning for certain and the "Wiechowszczyzna" awaits us. We must act quickly. Scribe Janecki's department is already preparing proscription lists.\n\nThe said Chief of Intelligence nodded knowingly.\n\n- - Excellent - replied Paladin Łukasz Warzecha, Head of the Infrastructure Department.\n- - Brothers, let us remember that many of our...fellow citizens are still faithful to good standards and if they found out what is really happening behind the scenes, they would support us with their body and soul. It would be good to use their enthusiasm.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Paladin Łukasz continued -\n\n- - I think we have reached a consensus. Knight Krzysztof - announce the brown alarm. We are on the brink of a new era, and only a wretched group of green crooks is keeping us from embracing it.\n\nThe knight started throwing rubber boots into the tiled stove. After a while, brown smoke, discernible only to the eager eyes of the initiated brethren (it barely stood out against the gray-black sky), gave signal for a secret mobilization."
belchatow.4.a: "Be ready for anything."

belchatow.5.t: "A Turbulent Work Day"
belchatow.5.desc: "Andrzej, Junior Knight of the Brotherhood, scratched his head in disbelief. It was already dawn and total darkness gave way to the gloom typical of Bełchatów. You could plainly see what happened during the night. Most of the windows were broken and shards of glass crunched under the feet of the dawdling passers-by. Each of them seemed to ignore the destruction. Rarely did anyone stop in front of the radiation signs painted in green paint. After a while, Andrzej himself began to look at them curiously.\n\nThese symbols were found only on those buildings that had their doors torn off their hinges. The bystanders seemed to be pleased with the effects of the night's "riots"\n\n- - - Knight Andrzej! Get your ass to work! I'm not a Scribe to cover yours for you! There is no time to enjoy the views.\n\n- But of course, Scribe Jakub, but of course...\n\nA small detachment entered one of the most devastated buildings - a small apartment block. Andrzej clenched his sweaty hands around his SMG RAK’s grip anxiously. His work day had begun...\n\n\n***\n\nList of Suspects. Entry No. 120.\n\nAddress - REDACTED\n\nReporting Officer - Junior Scribe Jakub W.\n\n“First apartment - married couple, suspected green media job before the Fall. The husband has 4 teeth knocked out and both legs broken. The wife has a black eye.\n\nSecond apartment - a family of five. Three teenagers included. Green literature found in the form of the book "Not all for the trash haul". The book was partially burnt. The youths were arrested for interrogation and rehabilitation purposes. The parents have been placed under supervision.\n\nThird apartment - Lonely man. A bum. He was performing prohibited recycling in the form of collecting cans for illegal trading in. Material evidence was confiscated. He resisted arrest and attacked the unit. He was intoxicated. Junior Knight Andrzej neutralized him with a burst from his Submachine Gun. Application for decoration sent to the council...""
belchatow.5.a: "Good soldiers follow orders."

belchatow.6.t: "Carbon Fever"
belchatow.6.desc: "The bus - an old, shabby Jelcz rocked mercilessly as it drove over the pothole littered road. Its passengers, mostly youths from nearby schools, either tried to fall asleep or were looking at the landscape shrouded by smog and the late hour’s dim light through the bus’ dirty windows. A dozen or so of them, members of a newly inaugurated class from one of the Bełchatów high schools, clearly differed from the rest. They were huddled and scared, just staring blankly at the floor beneath their feet.\n\nAfter a while the bus slowed down and finally stopped in front of a metal gate. The passengers spilled out at the sound of yelling hurrying them out. They were put in a single file line. Someone approached the freshmen with a submachine gun in his hand.\n\n- I am Knight Mateusz and from today you are to refer to me in this way. And you will tell me everything that I ask you about. Did I make myself clear?\n\n- Yes, sir! - answered the now-awakened freshmen\n\n- - Good, due to the increased demand for coal, you have been mobilized to work in the mines. Your absences from school will be excused. Maybe they will even raise your behavior marks. Your situation looks like this - 12 hours a day's work, and a half-hour break at 12:00. You will be allotted some food. To the changing room - MARCH!\n\n- Yes, sir - freshmen replied sluggishly, and went where they were shown."
belchatow.6.a: "Prosperity won't happen overnight"

belchatow.7.t: "Fumes of Kanada"
belchatow.7.desc: "A small squad composed of a Scribe and two Knights moved from apartment building to apartment building and from house to house. Every selected person moments after hearing the knock on their door, was already traveling on the steam tram. There, they listened to the speeches of one of the Elder Knights or Junior Paladins about the need for immediate mobilization. The enemy is close, right outside our gates, and we must eradicate him.\n\nThe enemy is close, right outside our gates, and we must eradicate him. The tram then traveled across town to the training base in the village of Kanada. This place had the reputation of a terrible slaughterhouse, but the conscripts knew that without pain, they would not be able to ensure constant economic growth. Once they got out, they were immediately brutally restrained, shaved bald and stripped of their belongings. Then, naked, they landed in the initiation room where, using a piece of coal, symbols were drawn on their bodies that they had to swear on - A Mine, A Bolt of Lightning and the Black Steam. The fumes released by burning fine coal put them in an ecstatic mood. They felt strong, ready to fulfill their historical role. Their mission had just begun..."
belchatow.7.a: "To Victory!"

belchatow.8.t: "Autumn"
belchatow.8.desc: "Elder Scribe Ziemkiewicz sat alone in the cafeteria. It was late, those who could were fast asleep, while those who had to were hard at work. However, the Brotherhood's media representative did not know what to do with himself.\n\nHe just unwittingly played with a fork stuck in a bowl of macaroni and cheese, mockingly known as spaghetti. He didn't know what to feel. Anger, fear, or maybe ... pride in the decisive nature of the organization to which he belonged. He was fresh from the last meeting of the Council. He knew what was about to happen. He knew what would happen in this city and on this earth. His hands started shaking. The thought of a nip of cognac hidden away in his Brotherhood robe (the council's latest idea) secretly flashed through his mind. He drank it all in one gulp. He calmed down. There is no way out. He must get to writing. Tomorrow's announcement needs to be ready. As well as those for all the following days..."
belchatow.8.a: "The future awaits."

belchatow.9.t: "Emergency Meeting"
belchatow.9.desc: ""Dear Brothers," Scribe Janecki began - "enough has been said about what will happen next"\n\nScribe Rafał Ziemkiewicz, involuntarily stroked the spine of his new book. The cover was thick and pleasantly rigid to the touch. After the highly detailed, suggestive visualization of the atomic bomb explosion, it was very clear that he wasn't skimping out on the first impressions for the readers.\n\n"We're ready," said the Brotherhood's Chief of Intelligence as he grabbed Chief Scribe's book. Its cover showed a young man in a suit with a thick tangle of curly hair on his head. He flipped through it casually. Knowing its contents by heart, he was habitually looking for any inaccuracies. It was unnecessary, of course.\n\n"Paladin Rzymkowski", he said, without taking his eyes off the publication, "Get to it."Without a word, the Chief of the Brotherhood's forces stood to attention, saluted and marched out of the room. The members of the Brotherhood’s guards followed soon after him."
belchatow.9.a: "Let's do this"

belchatow.10.t: "Wiechowszczyzna"
belchatow.10.desc: "§GJakub Wiech§!. This name echoed angrily wherever the Brotherhood’s Influence reached and wherever the two-part book by Scribe Ziemkiewicz - "Protocols of the Atomic Crusade" was distributed. The population cursed relentlessly at this madman who wanted to take their normality away from them. After all, the terrorist organization created by Wiech planned to destroy the power plant and build in its place an extremely dangerous, recovered nuclear reactor, probably some kind of RBMK from Ukraine.\n\nCombining extreme religious fundamentalism, the ethos of the knightly order and green atomic fanaticism, they almost drove the lands of the Brotherhood into the darkness of the Middle Ages, illuminated only by the glow of murderous radioactive waste. The icing on the cake of their madness was the suicidal plan of the §GHoly Green Revenge§! on Germany for the construction of Nord Stream 2.\n\nOnly the resolute attitude of the Brotherhood’s enforcers saved us from this terrible fate. But the tentacles of the "Wiechowszczyzna" reach deeper than previously assumed. The Atomic Crusaders are among us and among our neighbors. They are just waiting for a moment of the Brotherhood's weakness to strike again. If we do not stop them, they will fool the masses, especially the naive youth, and implement their ill-fated plans."
belchatow.10.a: "Let's do this...Let's do this..."

belchatow.11.t: "Operation "Bark Beetle""
belchatow.11.desc: "The suburbs of Belchatow. The archaic duplicator was spitting out page after page. Each of them had clear directives addressed to simple people written in large, plain font. Instructions on how to segregate trash, how to save water, how to combine various plant-based foods in a diet to effectively eliminate meat from it.\n\nTwo young people were scurrying around the little office. The woman was operating the printer. The man sorted the individual leaflets into piles. It was late, and there was only one window letting in faint moonlight. Light bulbs were forbidden so as to not make the Brotherhood spies’ jobs easier. Suddenly, a barely audible murmur came from outside the door. The man stopped dead in his tracks and quickly pulled the gun out from his belt\n\nSeeing this, the woman began to pour spirit over the entire printing apparatus. In an instant, the door blew up. Smoke rose all around. Sounds of gunfire and the steps of heavy boots flooded the room. The man was hit in the chest by a series of shots. He fell down cold between the pages, staining them with blood. The woman did not manage to pull the lighter out of her pockets as she was butt-stroked over the head. She fell to the ground,  was quickly handcuffed and taken outside. Inside the operational commander, with all the willpower available to him, kept himself from lighting a cigarette. He couldn't leave until he had his paperwork done. There was no time. By tomorrow, this action had to be finished."

belchatow.12.t: "Operation "Furnace""
belchatow.12.desc: "Bełchatów. One of the high schools. Civil Defense lesson. Last quarter to the bell. A tall teacher dressed in a habit of the Brotherhood walked back and forth between the school desks. He made sure everyone was taking notes in the right way. Suddenly, Brotherhood soldiers entered the room without knocking. All armed and armored. The teacher ordered the students to stand at attention. The commander of the newly arrived unit spoke. However, instead of talking to the students, he ordered his subordinates to search them. Crushed against their benches, they were silent as their backpacks and pockets were rummaged. Marijuana was quickly found - a green, unprocessed drug, and leaflets informing about the advantages of renewable energy over coal-based energy. All students, including those with no forbidden items, were transported to the Mine on the same day. There they were told that they had been sentenced to a month of community service. Shovels were handed out and put to work at gunpoint.\n\n\n "Hear you young one, listen nicely,\nAnd you’ll live life so precisely,\nYour own happiness you’ll come by,""

belchatow.13.t: "Operation "Chimney""
belchatow.13.desc: "Elżbieta, a civil servant of the Brotherhood, was barely standing. Her day at work was very tiring, she was non-stop legitimizing the arriving and departing Adepts and Paladins. Now, calmly, in her house in the suburbs of Bełchatów, she was drinking her evening tea. Thanks to having a good job, she could afford a beautiful, one-story house with a fireplace in the living room. She liked to sit on the couch to the sound of sizzling wood or coal and drink delicious tea. And sometimes even spiked tea. And so she did this time. A 100ml shot of "Brunatna" mixed with a decoction of nettles and sage. Elizabeth treated herself to a wonderful evening.\n\n Suddenly, around 10 p.m., the fire in the fireplace suddenly went out. “Tired” Ela struggled to get up from the soft armchair and bent over the barely burning coals. After a short while, she noticed something long and gray among the ashes. She did not even have time to scream when the mysterious object flashed bright light with the deafening sound. Black-clad Brotherhood members burst into the house. They handcuffed the stunned Ela and began to brutally search the apartment. The book "Gardener's Guide" was quickly found. The commanding officer considered the description of sunflower cultivation to be disguised propaganda about the propagation of solar energy. Material evidence was confiscated and Elżbieta, suspected of betraying the ideals of the Brotherhood, was taken by the Black Paladins"
belchatow.13.a: "Loyalty is always uncertain."

belchatow.14.t: "Apocalyptic View"
belchatow.14.desc: "The steady sound of the steam engine filled the interior of the railbus. Converting it to steam propulsion was difficult but not impossible. Inside, apart from the frightened pupils of Tomaszów's primary schools, there were armed guards of the Brotherhood. The landscape outside was apocalyptic. The traces of fighting have not yet been removed, only one track at the Widzew station was passable. The rest were blown up. The blackened blocks of the nearby estate were marked with traces of artillery fire. After a short stop for the identification of passengers, the train continued, via Niciarniana towards Fabryczna.\n\n TThe beautiful station building miraculously survived the war, although in many places the glass roof was full of holes from bullets and explosions. The inhabitants of Łódź, recruited for work, were just cleaning shards of glass from the floor. The students were rushed by the guards onto the tram. The poorly installed boiler filled the first passenger car with smoke, while some seeped out to the surrounding cars. All that could be heard was coughing and heavy breathing drowned out by the sound of the locomotive. After the mercilessly long ride, the tram stopped next to the former Manufaktura. Stretching further was only nuclear wasteland of Bałuty. The makeshift fence made of mesh and hollow bricks could not cover the gray-green sea of rubble. Then an agitator - a scribe of the Brotherhood - entered the rostrum by the fence.\n\n- Take a look. This is the result of the lies that green fascists, leftists and other lunatics have been pouring into your head. Here lies the culmination of all false progress - Total Atomic Annihilation!\n\nLet me just remind you - it is thanks to coal that you are here, it gives us real, stable power. Thanks to it, we will be able to rebuild the city. And it is thanks to it that we will rid this glowing, green stain off the surface of the Earth!"

belchatow.15.t: "To Celebrate or not to Celebrate?"
belchatow.15.desc: "Members of the Brotherhood Council were in a great mood. Everything that could be achieved at this point has been achieved. However, they did not celebrate. They rested. Tobacco smoke was floating around in the conference room, bottles of "Brunatna" were scattered about. Ah, "Brunatna''. Innovative alcohol made of sugar and a small hint of coal had an enormous kick to it. Scribe Ziemkiewicz was spread out on three linked chairs languishing. Scribe Janecki, with a cigarette in his mouth, looked at the portrait of Tomasz Sommer hanging on the wall.\n\nPaladins Warzecha and Gadomski talked about the superiority of diesel without a catalyst and with a resistor mounted on the pump over a gasoline engine. Paladin Rzymkowski was cleaning his pistol on the conference table. Suddenly there was a knock on the door. Paladin Rzymkowski ordered the person to come in. A trembling Adept, one of Ziemkiewicz’s subordinates, ran inside. The high Scribe, seeing him, got up with a groan and sat down on one of the chairs.\n\nThe Adept handed him a piece of paper that looked to be some kind of report. Holding his head up with one hand, Ziemkiewicz grabbed the letter and started reading. With each passing second, the blurry eyes regained their focus. His hand dropped from his head. His mouth opened wide and his gaze went to the other council members, increasingly disoriented by his facial expressions. Shocked, he only said..."

belchatow.16.desc: "Ever since Piotrków had fallen to the Brotherhood, deafening silence in both the streets and homes soon followed. Almost every Hooligan had already been captured, or was smart enough to blend in with the local population or to hide out in the nearby forests. However, the typical hogwash of Brotherhood propaganda and the distinctly rosey daily news were supposed to be replaced with a “Special Interview” today. A young, 20 or so year old man began talking shortly after a shortened version of the news.\n\n“At the start, I was just a fan of the Club, then I was a believer... a fanatic. I was tempted and manipulated by a man claiming to be a prophet. I was convinced that the only path towards a good future was prayer, football matches and returning to the Red Plague of days long gone. However the Brotherhood cured my blindness, I see now how backwards and obscene those views were. That is why I’m calling all of you, my comrades, to lay down your arms and sign up for the Rehabilitation Draft. Thank you for your attention.”\n\nAnd with those words, the transmission went silent, though in the coming days, it’s almost certain that there will be more testimonies from those changed for the better."

IT'S LITERALLY JUDEOCOMMUNISM!!! - thundered Marcin Rola on one of his pathostreams.\n\nRecently, the Brotherhood's media circulated photos of burning military recruitment commissions and riots in the largest cities of the conquered territories, mainly in Tomaszów Mazowiecki, Piotrków Trybunalski and Opoczno. The fans, led by former Red Army officers, took to the streets in protest against Elder Paladin Rzymkowski's proposal to try to recruit the Widzewiaks as auxillaries.\n\nAccompanied by screams and yells brimming with profanities, the most important of which are: "Starszy, matole! Twój rząd obalą kibole!" which literally translates as "Elder, you oaf! Your Brotherhood will be overthrown by hooligans".\nOne could only respond to such speeches with fire and smoke. Our response will need to be swift and brutal.

At an extraordinary meeting of the board of directors, which lasted almost a whole day, all options were discussed in depth.\n\nEbrantil and his entire Paramedics faction were categorically against any merger, Rutkowski was in favor, and Skrzydlewski hesitated. Considering all the pros and cons, they came to an agreement with our delegation. All economic entities of the Consortium will retain their market position, autonomy on the incorporated territories and the possibility of development in the new state on equal terms. Only then these written assurances finally convinced Skrzydlewski to tip the scales and sign the merger document.\n\nThe amalgamation of the two largest economic powers in the region outside the capital is definitely a game changer, and possibly the final decisive stage for the Brotherhood's hegemony over the other warlords.

Whether it was out of fear or caution, they believed that this was what would cause Skrzydlewski to bow down.\n\nUnfortunately, they were cruelly wrong.\n\nOur intelligence services, a few weeks before the negotiations, reported on the growing sentiment among  Krośniewice’s elites towards us. But apparently political considerations did not apply here, only the tangible economic gain mattered. Ultimately, they correctly recognized that submission to the authority of the Brotherhood would mean the end of their economic freedom and strict regulations including the commencement of a program of central planning that would follow.\n\nTheir refusal was categorical and clear. Any attempt to interfere with the economic, or any other form of independence of the Consortium will result in immediate retaliation using any means necessary, and they will not hesitate to use whatever means are available to repel the invader. If the rumors of Ebrantil's miracle weapons are true, it is likely that his inventions ultimately led Skrzydlewski to make this bold but ultimately stupid decision."

belchatow.20.t: "Industrial Planners Demand More Coal"
belchatow.20.desc: "To kickstart our plan of mitigating industrial losses we need coal, coal and once again coal. This necessary resource is used to power up our cities, our factories and is instrumental in creating certain materials like steel. Our Industrial Planners know that too, and they’re asking us for increased production of the "Black Gold"."
belchatow.20.a: "So, back in the mine we go..."

belchatow.21.t: "Planners Demand Expanding the Capital"
belchatow.21.desc: "Bełchatów. Our own Pearl of progress lies in the vast sea of decline. It's a truly remarkable city, upgraded by us to its greatest extent thus far. Constantly bustling with new factories, speeding cars, people walking back and forth, but it's also known for one thing, no other city in this god forsaken country can provide. This thing is constant, unending progress. Every day new factories are being built, new industrial zones planned and another family finds their new home. It's all beautiful and remarkable in its own right, but as all good things this one also hangs on the brink of an end. If we do not refurbish or build new, critical city infrastructure, it's doomed to hit the glass ceiling of industrial progress. City officials know that and demanded that we divert our resources to achieve this arduous task."
belchatow.21.a: "Let's hope its worth it"

belchatow.22.t: "Time to Meet Quota"
belchatow.22.desc: "It's been a while since we announced the project of rapid growth for our industrial efficiency, aimed at combating the decline that is perpetrated by these ungrateful eco-terrorists. Almost all of our nation and government has worked for it, experiencing many austerities and challenges. All of it makes it especially important, as failure to meet these expectations will create voices of doubt both public and in the party itself. It's a task we mustn't fail on, not this time and not ever again."
belchatow.22.a: "The final test to find out, if our project works."

belchatow.23.t: "Arising Problem"
belchatow.23.desc: "It hasn’t gone without our notice that our industrial output has shown signs of a slowdown or, even outright decline. It's not much, in fact it's possibly a simple growth fluctuation, prevalent in every rising economy. Yet it was enough for these "experts" to accuse us of spearheading ecosystem destruction and our death with it, blah, blah, blah. Of course these lies haven't gone unnoticed, both by other terrorists and our security forces which quickly took matters into their own hands. Truth is, that all of it is the fault of these eco-fascists who refuse to work with us for a better future, instead constantly trying to hamper the march of  civilization. There is only one solution. Increased Mass Industrialization! Of course such a move will stretch our resources dangerously thin, creating many new problems and before unheard of demands, which finding a solution for will be a priority if we want to further our might, but we’ve already been in worse situations, so surely we will deal with whatever road bumps await us and arise yet again, victorious."
belchatow.23.a: "We'll deal with it, like Men!"

belchatow.24.t: "Good Beginnings to Bad End"
belchatow.24.desc: "Aleksander was a simple man. So simple that when the fall happened, he lost almost nothing. These are the benefits of a man living in one place, sustaining himself only from the work of his own muscles and a small field these muscles are cultivating. That was how his life was supposed to look like from beginning to the end, at least he though that way. Everything changed in a moment, when a Brotherhood's corporation decided to build a paint factory near Aleksander's village. This and a Brotherhood's propaganda of rejecting "Shackles of Nature" and achieving "Full potential of Humanity", made Alek feel one emotion he never felt in his life, this emotion was Ambition.\n\nIt wasn't long before he found a job there, simmilar to hundreds of other people just like him who before were much closer to vegetating than living a true life. Combination of his tinkering skills with his newfound ambition, resulted in him becoming one of the main engineers, entrusted with maintaining factory machines in best possible condition. All of this changed Aleksander's life completely, his old house recieved a much needed renovation, his wife had new and beautiful jewelry, his son got an opportunity to study in Bełchatów at a National Energy and Mining Institute, while he himself was driving every day to work in a new volkswagen, freshly smuggled from Germany. Life was good.\n\nToo good to be only good. So as with everything in this world it hasn't came without a price. Alek first started to notice that something was off not long after the factory was built, at that time nearby river that was always brightly blue, was now changing its color everyday, suprisingly to the excactly same color as the paint's color that was produced today. With time things became only escalated, as clouds started to darken, birds and animals have become sick or were found dead, one time Alek found that his neglected field gave him a batch of purple potatoes. It all was weird, unnatural, but was that so suprising as he himself, rejected nature in pursuit of his Ambitions? It certainly wasn't a suprise to the Brotherhood, which always reacted to these events as either "a perfect exemple of ecoterrorism" or as a unfounded farce created by attention searchers. Aleksander knew for sure only one thing, that it's not the end, but a beginning to changes that will spill all over the country, transforming it beyond recognition, whether it will be for the better or for the §RWorse...§!"
belchatow.24.a: "A perfect example of EcoFascist Deception!"

belchatow.27.t: "Demand Unfulfilled"
belchatow.27.desc: "Midnight struck at the local clock tower, signaling the end of one day and the beginning of a new one. Truth is, it wasn't just that, a new day meant also an end to Industrial deadline that was scheduled to be finished last night. Sadly we fucked up. We failed to deliver what we promised and now our industry, people and a party public image is gonna hugely suffer. This failure won't kill us and we can quite easily recover from this but, its a drop cracking a rock. If this drop won't turn out to be the last one and more are coming ,than quick recovery from these losses might not be an option anymore."
belchatow.27.a: "Ouch, this will hurt."

belchatow.28.t: "Demand Accomplished"
belchatow.28.desc: "A new report just came in. It says that our efforts regarding the request we received recently from our Industrial Planners, has been fully accomplished. It's a great victory both for us and for our brave and industrious people. Such an accomplishment is a fire that will surely keep our Industrial Crusade marching onwards."
belchatow.28.a: "Splendid!"

belchatow.29.t: "Military-Industrial Complex"
belchatow.29.desc: "Every military superpower needs its Industrial base that will keep it stocked on the battlefield. Knowing full well that the Łódzkie Unification Wars are probably right around the corner, it's certain that such an industrial base is a top priority for us, especially since we barely have such a capabilities in the first place. This won't be cheap or easy but if we want to be victorious in these ensuing days, we have to accomplish this hard task. If somehow we weren't able to complete the construction of said industry, we could always achieve similar results just by taking over whatever our enemies managed to put together. We would have to do this quickly though, as a continued lack of these capabilities will severely tarnish our war effort."
belchatow.29.a: "Victory always demands §tSacrifice§!"

belchatow.30.t: "Treaty of Ksawerów"
belchatow.30.desc: "Ksawerów became in a short time transformed from a small suburban village into a developing industrial district, from which the chimneys spew black smoke of progress every day. This was where the delegation of the Free City of Łódź was headed to negotiate an economic treaty between Łódź and the Brotherhood. They have a lot of problems, and energy is crucial for them, so it may turn out that we will be able to put a lot of pressure on them, because nowhere else in the region they will find an electricity supplier.\n\n- Hurry up! Clean up this shit, goddamn it! When the dialogites arrive, it is supposed to shine here! And if even one of these beggars shows up here, your heads will roll! - Discipline officer shouted to his subordinates.\n\nThe delegation arrived at the Ksawerowski Palace delighted with the clean streets and industrial plants where combustion was reduced for the duration of the negotiations, but the officials did not know what was hidden behind the corners of the carefully prepared route. Each visible element has been prepared in such a way as to make the greatest impression of a powerful, developing country.\n\nThe head of the delegation, Marek Belka, was pleased. And very conciliatory. He agreed to pay practically double the standard kilowatt-hour rate. Or they were just very desperate because they agreed without batting an eye on everything we pressed them. It's not a good sign when the other party doesn't even try to negotiate. But money is money. Gadomski returned triumphant with the Treaty of Ksawerów signed, and the whole Brotherhood council was overjoyed with prospects of Łódź opening their markets for our industrialists."

All those facts were in Rzymkowski's head as one of many interviews he's been conducting was coming to an end.\n - So, Jacek...\n- Umm, it's Michał, sir.\n - Yes, of course - his mind started drifting away after so many candidates - You've got quite a résumé. You present an almost ideal predisposition to fight for our cause. Almost. From 2001-2006 you've been a member of Newsweek's editorial board. If only you've been as pure as your brother - Rzymkowski pointed at Jacek Karnowski, who was being interviewed alongside his twin - Him we could recruit.\n - Those were different times - Michał Karnowski started defending himself - It was long before the diabolical reign of Tomasz Lis. I've changed and my brother needs me to work effectively. Besides, what kind of Brotherhood would separate brothers?\nRzymkowski wasn't in the mood to argue. And the Brotherhood needed commanders.\n - Fine. Welcome, Brothers - he shook their hands - You will pledge your loyalty to the Brotherhood in the ceremony next week.\n - Next!\n After the Karnowski twins were gone, another duo of candidates. But they didn't look like brothers.\n Paladin-in-Chief looked at the list.\n - Ah, Mr. Zychowicz and Mr. Bartosiak. - Time to see if those 'military experts' are really worth their money - What do you bring to the table?\nReal conquest - Zychowicz began - Conquest happening your eyes. But before another question, I'd like like to give the floor to my colleague, Jacek Bartosiak.\nBefore Rzymkowski could intervene geopolitics expert started his disquisition.\n - While the Brotherhood's power projection in Łódź region especially in Bełchatów Isthmus, it moved your country up in the escalation ladder. We can't jump to conclusion, but without the New Model Army, it may be a matter of time, before your neighbors in rimlands will say 'I doubt it'.\nShit, those guys really seem to know their stuff - Rzymkowski thought to himself."

Today, the region has become active again; \n\nIn the city of Łódź, Rafał Ziemkiewicz - a highly conservative author and journalist in the past - has proclaimed complete hegemony of the so-called "Brotherhood of Coal" over the past voivodeship's area. The Brotherhood - a military order of anti-ecological fanatics - has taken it upon itself to destroy green politics and bring "common sense" and technological and economical progress back to Poland. The clique's reputation and economical and military power are a source of alarm for its neighbors, and it looks like we too will have to keep a closer eye on it, lest we have to bend under the power of coal and steel."

As the public consciousness about global warming increased many, particularly in the West, are anxious that the faction that seemingly wants the world to burn has not yet been put down and even has grown in power putting down the pro-atomic rebellion. As of now, other factions may still defeat the Brotherhood by forcing Ziemkiewicz's faction into a stalemate. It is possible that the Carbon Counter-revolution may yet be stopped.

Only a few factions on the territory of former Poland can stop them.

While manny welcome the change, some accuse her of being merely a mask steered by the old guard whose purpose is to deceive the West with empty promises to gain international recognition. The less sceptical still doubt wheter she can undo the damage already done by the previous administration."

POLITICS_RAFAL_ZIEMKIEWICZ_DESC: "2027, Bełchatów. \n\nWłókniarzy. Lipowa. 1 Maja. \nEvery day, an old, angry and very blunt in his thinking man stalks these streets, coughing and wheezing on his way. A random passerby might think he's just some poor, old sap whose lungs drown in the smog spewed by the nearby power plant. Those native to these streets know that this smog is, in fact - this old man's life force. \n\nFew are of more merit to the Brotherhood than its elder and first scribe. When the country was plunged into chaos, Ziemkiewicz was a force that unified the people around the ideals of lasting survival and the restoration of normality by utilising the technological superiority of coal energy and a strong hierarchical order. A known writer, his books became the basis of the Brotherhood's ideology and vision of a better future – one based on rough interests and fighting against the dictate of green fascism enforced by the ecologist EU menace, and though his leadership is largely symbolic, he is still nonetheless the most respected person within the Brotherhood.\n\nProudly observing the black clouds from behind dust-stained panes of glass fresh off of one of the many industrial furnaces built by the Brotherhood, Ziemkiewicz is hellbent on spreading the good old ways of common sense to the rest of the country. To that, he has his factories (to craft weapons of war), his motorized army (to bring progress to the backwards green leftists), his books (to fuel people's hearts and minds) and his fingers (to angrily tweet with). That being said... \n\nDoubts slowly make their way into Ziemkiewicz's  head. ''Is this truly the right course of action?'' ''Is our cause *cough* truly right?'' ''More and more *cough* reports of breathing-related illnesses and poisoned plots of land reach our *cough, cough* offices, and-'' No. Enough. Without a REAL, coal-and-oil powered industry Poland would be nothing. There would be no electricity, no production, no jobs, no cars - we'd live in a medieval shithole. We are the Brotherhood. We follow common sense. Our words are backed with deadly weapons of war and great production chains. We ARE right, and we WILL prevail. \n\n*cough*"


POLITICS_LUKASZ_WARZECHA_DESC: "§LSteam Trams - one of the many marvels of the Brotherhood’s engineering are but one of the Elder of Transportation’s grand ideas. The roaring coal-powered machines glide back and forth across the Bełchatów area providing efficient and cheap transport to its denizens. While Warzecha himself is a great proponent of motorization and the usage of fossil fuels, his plans have thus far largely been hindered by the massive fuel deficit that followed the Fall. Together with his followers, he was one of the first to heed Ziemkiewicz’s call to action, and his supply of trucks and SUVs proved essential to securing the Bełchatów region.§!"
POLITICS_STANISLAW_JANECKI_DESC: "§LThe gray eminence of the Brotherhood, the Elder responsible for gathering intelligence and handling state secrets hardly ever talks about his past. When so, he provides contradictory information, shrouding his former life in an aura of mystery. The single scraps of data regarding his previous exploits, whether in old newspaper clippings or archived internet articles, are being diligently removed by his web of underlings before they reach the public eye. Nobody is better than Janecki in closing the lips of inquisitive wannabe detectives, and the other Elders know that fact crystal-clear, utilizing his skills to find and silence any signs of dissent within the Brotherhood. But sometimes even they wonder whether they know who Janecki truly is...§!"
POLITICS_TOMASZ_RZYMKOWSKI_DESC: "§LOne of the youngest members of the Brotherhood’s Elite, and nevertheless one of its most powerful, serving as the clique's Paladin-in-Chief. Following the Fall Rzymkowski made use of his old contacts in the National Movement, helping his late predecessor Tomasz Sommer with the organization of the Brotherhood’s military forces. He created a system of indoctrinating new recruits, hailing them as defenders of common sense, fighting back against the Green Scourge. Later, he worked as the Black Curator, re-carbonizing the core curriculum in schools to stop the environmentalist corruption of the youth. His closest subordinates are known as the most fanatical members of the Brotherhood, tightly wrapped up in his ideological influence.§!"
POLITICS_WITOLD_GADOMSKI_DESC: "§LThe most ideologically questionable of the Brotherhood’s Elders, responsible for handling the economy. Gadomski's past activity in „Gazeta Wyborcza”, a liberal newspaper promoting disastrous ecologist and green-aligned ideas, made him a very unlikely candidate to ever join the Brotherhood's ranks, let alone rise to the position of one of its highest Elites. Yet, he has since proven his dedication to the cause tenfold, making use of his understanding of economic organization to assemble an entire financial system practically from scratch. Despite his deeply neoliberal beliefs, Gadowski accepts the usage of interventionist methods as necessary to ensure the final victory of the Brotherhood and its values.§!"
POLITICS_TOMASZ_SOMMER_DESC: "§LIf an outsider were to ask a Bełchatów citizen to name someone they consider a hero, an ideal man, and a dedicated soldier, he will no doubt hear the name of the Paladin-in-chief in response. It was he who stood against every threat to the Brotherhood's survival, leading his fellow troops to one victory after another. His fierce attacks on the Scouts, Hooligans, and the Dialogue followers often ended with bloody but successful results, bringing glory to our regime. Revered among the highest echelons, Sommer's grandeur and influence rival even those of the High Elder himself. Now, whenever the Paladin’s Black Opel Insignia drives along Bełchatów’s streets, many cheer and take off their caps in respect. Others, however, remain silent...§!"
POLITICS_JAKUB_WIECH_DESC: "A figure one could say is a shadow of Ziemkiewicz. A journalist turned a leader of the energy-fetishizing organisation. Unlike Ziemkiewicz, he's been a known supporter of the nuclear energy. Anserwing the call of duty, he left relatively safe Kielce after the Brotherhood of Coal was established as he believed them to be one of the most dangerous faction in Poland. As a principled journalist he didn't want to lead as a future political leader. He and his upporters mearly wanted to spread the facts about the Brotherhood's misdeeds and nuclear energy. Time showed it wasn't enough to stop the radicalization of Ziemkiewicz's organization. Quite contrary. After years of being called a Green Terrorist and an ecofascist, he finally let his followers arm himself to rise against the Bełchatów order of nutjobs. Despite this sad turn of events, he still adheres to the values of meritocracy, honesty and falsificationism. Espite he's reluctance he is getting quite popular due to his refined presence, frendly disposition and erudition. Many believe he's the best chance for Poles to have a democratic as well as technocratic government and a hope for Poland duided by the true common sense - a common sense backed by the scientific research."
POLITICS_ROKSANA_WEGIEL_DESC: "Roksana Węgiel needn't have taken part in politics. Even after the Fall, she had a successful career as a singer. Her involvement is a clear sign of idealism and selflessness. At least, that's what her supporters say. The truth may not be as flattering, as the number of her concerts had greatly increased since she joined the Carbonari. Then again, she could've stopped there and got some cushy job as a speaker and yet, she choose to rally the youth and became an Eldress accepting the great responsibility of steering the Brotherhood.\nWhatever the truth, she distances herself from Ziemkiewicz's radical narrative allowing herself to pursue a more moderate and flexible approach.\n'Though ways are needed for tough times and those are way behind us' is the motto of her reign."
