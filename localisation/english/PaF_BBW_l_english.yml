It still bothers me… What made them do it? We gave them electricity, we maintained civilization and we developed it, in spite of the turmoil caused by the war. How could they give up their normal life and… kill these people. Three teenagers, they've barely graduated. Why would they murder others in cold blood? There is still so much confusion...

I tried to cut myself off from all the confusion for a moment by writing a new book, but nothing wants to stick. I just keep walking back and forth. A moment ago, Tomek called, he said that in the city people are still standing in the streets. Among them members of the victims' families were seen dressed in black. I can't sit here forever, but what should I do? If we try to get the situation under control, we will turn out to be soulless as PiS rabble from before the war. No, we can't appear to be like them. One must wait and pray that time will heal all wounds. The guards will be on high alert, but I hope they won't have to leave the barracks. It's over for today.

You know what's waiting right under our noses. The Brotherhood Council meeting is in three hours' time, attendance is mandatory.”\n\nHe hung up after those words. I walked over to the guard and let him know I was going out onto the balcony. The cigarette glow was the only thing that illuminated the area around my dacha. There was a deafening silence all around. Just the murmuring of the sentries in the bushes. I took a drag off my cigarette and smoke filled my lungs. The tension somewhat eased. But I still felt blood pulsing rapidly through my veins. If Łukasz addresses someone by their title in an informal conversation, it means that whatever it is really, really bad\n\n- “Knight Marek!” - I growled at the sentry behind the glass balcony door. – “Get the car ready.

But it is impossible not to notice how much hatred was contained in them. Although they were handcuffed, they threatened that the days of the Brotherhood are numbered, that someone would finally take us on and that the power plants would be all blown up. And the slogans about killing nature... Here's our reward for trying to maintain at least a little bit of normality for the people.

Something that will make the miserable explosion of a makeshift bomb look like an infinitely imperfect tracing of… ourselves. An unsurpassed formula.

Besides, there would be no end to the wars to take control of the power plant. Everyone would like to own it, and this could lead to chaos and destruction of the facility.

Even though we do not have direct iron deposits, scrap metal around us is abundant. It is considered gross by some to recycle, but in fact it is a whole new production cycle. Our new American economics expert, Christian Paulson, believes so.\n\nAfter all, recycling is basically an individual activity, and here a large plant will be responsible for it. If its area formally covers all our dominion, then there will be no question of collecting garbage but only "using scattered warehouses of semi-finished materials"\n\nThat is why it was rightly recognized at the meeting of the Council that building a large steam scrap yard is a historic necessity.

Chances are our "trading partners" won't be able to resist it.\n\nMoreover, along with the new unit, new plants will be built and those for which there was no capacity before, will be reopened as well. It's wonderful to be rich. Everyone will admit it. And the more wealth the better. Hence the new Council decision to allocate a portion of the money directly to the people.

The "Trial of Three", as the press vibrantly wrote about this event, was on the lips of all residents of Bełchatów from the moment the date of the hearing was announced. In other cities, people listened intently to their CB radios, and where the Internet was still up and running, they waited impatiently for the next lines of the transcript written meticulously by one of the scribes.\n\nDespite protest, some brought framed photos of the attack’s victims to the court. What happened in the very courtroom can only be described as pure chaos. Despite the instructions and frantic interventions of the guards, the crowd of spectators still raised angry jeers at the three inconspicuous teenagers. Two of them stared dispassionately at the accused’s desk.The third and youngest one, was staring aggressively towards the tribunal and at the onlookers every now and then, inciting further screams and threats. And so it went on like that for several hours, until everyone, simply tired of the procedures, began to listen to the accusations.\n\n At least until the chief prosecutor - High Paladin Tomasz Sommer - took the floor. Summoned by the tribunal, he had great difficulty controlling his emotions while reading the findings of the investigation committee.\n- "The accused acted as part of an organized criminal group describing themselves as the "League of Environmental Defenders", planning, by means of terror, to overthrow the state apparatus and to bring about social changes in the spirit of misunderstood and radical nature protection..."\nWhen he was seated after a while, the tribunal was forced to interrupt the hearing and lead the accused and the spectators out. The roar of the word "DEATH!" reverberating within the walls of the auditorium was overwhelming."

We have failed, we have handed over the younger generation and some of the old to eco-terrorists and climate liars! How did Wiech's writings reach the people?! We've slept well for way too long and now we're going to bear the consequences. The attacks so far are only the beginning for certain and the "Wiechowszczyzna" awaits us. We must act quickly.

It would be good to use their enthusiasm.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Paladin Łukasz continued -\n\n- - I think we have reached a consensus. Knight Krzysztof - announce the brown alarm. We are on the brink of a new era, and only a wretched group of green crooks is keeping us from embracing it.\n\nThe knight started throwing rubber boots into the tiled stove.

With time things became only escalated, as clouds started to darken, birds and animals have become sick or were found dead, one time Alek found that his neglected field gave him a batch of purple potatoes. It all was weird, unnatural, but was that so suprising as he himself, rejected nature in pursuit of his Ambitions? It certainly wasn't a suprise to Brotherhood, which always reacted to these events as either "a perfect exemple of ecoterrorism" or as a unfounded farce created by attention searchers. Aleksander knew for sure only one thing, that it's not the end, but a beginning to changes that will spill all over the country, transforming it beyond recognition, whether it will be for the better or for the §RWorse...§!"

We failed to deliver what we promised and now our industry, people and a party public image is gonna hugely suffer. This failure won't kill us and we can quite easily recover from this but, its a drop cracking a rock.

Knowing full well that the Łódzkie Unification wars are probably right around the corner, it's certain that such an industrial base is a top priority for us, especially since we barely have such a capabilities in the first place. This won't be cheap or easy but if we want to be victorious in these ensuing days, we have to accomplish this hard task. If somehow we weren't able to complete the construction of said industry, we could always achieve similar results just by taking over whatever our enemies managed to put together. We would have to do this quickly though, as a continued lack of these capabilities will severely tarnish our war effort."

unification.2.desc:0 "Despite communications dying down in Poland after the Fall, there's always been a steady stream of information flowing out of the past Łódź Voivodeship due to the nuclear incident in Bałuty and the investigation surrounding it. Today, the region has become active again; \n\nIn the city of Łódź, Rafał Ziemkiewicz - a highly conservative author and journalist in the past - has proclaimed complete hegemony of the so-called "Brotherhood of Coal" over the past voivodeship's area. The Brotherhood - a military order of anti-ecological fanatics - has took it upon itself to destroy green politics and bring "common sense" and technological and economical progress back to Poland. The clique's reputation and economical and military power are a source of alarm for its neighbours, and it looks like we too will have to keep a closer eye on it, lest we have to bend under the power of coal and steel."
unification.2.a:0 "...and so the Brotherhood pushes forward, like a smoke-spewing locomotive."

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_RAFAL_ZIEMKIEWICZ_DESC:0 "Few are of more merit to the Brotherhood than its elder and first scribe. When the country was plunged into chaos, Ziemkiewicz was a force that unified the people around the ideals of lasting survival and the restoration of normality by utilising the technological superiority of coal energy and a strong hierarchical order. Though his leadership is largely symbolic, he is nonetheless the most respected person within the Brotherhood. His books, widely popularized in Brotherhood territories after the Fall of Poland created the vision of a better future – based on rough interests and fighting against the dictate of green fascism enforced by the ecologist EU menace. Despite the initial fervor that had helped organize the Brotherhood and its state, he asks himself, more and more frequently – “Do people really appreciate our efforts?"
POLITICS_LUKASZ_WARZECHA_DESC:0 "Steam Trams; one of the many marvels of the Brotherhood’s engineering are but one of the Elder of Transportation’s grand ideas. The roaring coal powered machines glide across the Bełchatów area providing efficient and cheap transport to its denizens. While Warzecha himself is a great proponent of motorisation and the use of fossil fuels, a spanner was thrown into his plans, in the form of a massive fuel deficit following the Fall. Together with his followers, he was one of the first people to heed Ziemkiewicz’s call to action and was instrumental in securing the Bełchatów area using their trucks and SUVs."
POLITICS_STANISLAW_JANECKI_DESC:0 "The gray eminence of the Brotherhood and the Elder responsible for gathering intelligence and handling state secrets hardly ever talks about his past. If so, he gives contradictory information, making his past an even bigger mystery than it already was. The scraps of data on the internet are being successfully removed by his web of underlings. Nobody is better than Janecki in closing the lips of inquisitive people and the other Elders know that crystal clear, using his skills in finding and silencing any sign of dissent within the Brotherhood. But sometimes even they wonder whether they know who Janecki really is..."
POLITICS_TOMASZ_RZYMKOWSKI_DESC:0 "One of the youngest members of the Brotherhood’s Elite who has taken the role of the new Paladin-in-Chief. After the Fall Rzymkowski made use of his old contacts in the National Movement and had helped the late Paladin-in-Chief Tomasz Sommer with the organization of the Brotherhood’s military forces. He also created a system that indoctrinates the rookies hailing them as defenders of common sense, fighting back the Green Scourge, which massively boosts their morale. Later he worked as the Black Curator recarbonizing the core curriculum in schools. His closest subordinates are known as the most fanatical Brotherhood members, being tightly wrapped up in his ideological influence."
POLITICS_WITOLD_GADOMSKI_DESC:0 "The most dubious of the Brotherhood’s Elders, responsible for handling the economy. His past activity in „Gazeta Wyborcza”, a liberal newspaper where disastrous ecologist and green-aligned ideas flourished made him a very unlikely candidate to serve as a Brotherhood member, let alone one of the top Elites. Surprisingly after he made use of his understanding of economic organization and he swore allegiance to Brotherhood’s ideals, he proved his usefulness and dedication to the cause. Despite his deeply neoliberal beliefs, he accepts the usage of interventionist methods as necessary to ensure victory of the Brotherhood and its values."
POLITICS_TOMASZ_SOMMER_DESC:0 "If a foreigner asks a Bełchatów citizen who's a hero, an ideal man and soldier, he will without a doubt hear the name and surname of the Paladin-in-chief as a response. It was him who stood against every early threat to the Brotherhood, leading his fellow soldiers to victory after victory. His fierce attacks on Scouts, Hooligans and the Dialogue followers often ended with bloody but successful results. Even Elder Ziemkiewicz wrote a lot about them, giving Sommer great fame and recognition. Now, as the Paladin’s Black Opel Insignia drives along Bełchatów’s streets many people are cheering and taking off their caps. Others however are silent..."
