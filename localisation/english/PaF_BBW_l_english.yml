It still bothers me, what made them do it... We gave them electricity, we kept civilization and developed it, despite the turmoil of war. How could they give up a normal life and… kill these people. Three teenagers, they've barely graduated. Why would they blow up others in cold blood? There is still so much confusion...

I tried to cut myself off from all the confusion for a moment by writing a new book but nothing wants to stick together. I just walk from wall to wall. A moment ago, Tomek called, said that in the city people are still standing in the streets. Among them were seen members of the victims' families dressed in black. I can't sit here forever, but what should I do? If we try to get the situation under control, we will turn out to be soulless as PiS rabble from before the war. No, we can't appear to be like them. One must wait and pray that time will heal all wounds. The guards will be on the alert, but I hope they won't leave the barracks. It's over for today. I need to sleep, I have to be in full strength.

You know what's waiting under our noses. The Brotherhood Council meeting is in three hours' time, attendance is mandatory.\n\nHe hung up after these words. I walked over to the guard and let him know I was going out onto the balcony. The cigarette glow was the only thing that illuminated the area around my dacha. There is a deafening silence all around. Just the murmuring of the sentries in the bushes. I took a puff and the smoke filled my lungs. The tension kind of eased. But I still felt the blood pulsing rapidly through my veins. If Łukasz addresses someone by the title in an informal conversation, it means that it is really very bad.\n\n- Knight Mark! - I growled at the sentry behind the glass balcony door. - Get yourselves and the car ready.

But it is impossible not to notice how much hatred has accumulated in them. Although they were handcuffed, they threatened that the days of the Brotherhood are numbered, that someone would finally take on us and the power plants would be blown up. And the slogans about the dying nature... here's the reward for trying to keep at least a bit of normality for people. They wanted to kill us for pork chops on tables, electricity in sockets and running water in the taps.

Just like the people and deeds they praise. Italian marble will be transformed into an image of strength and seriousness by the best available artists - former students of the Łódź Academy of Fine Arts. Inside, there will be a large, steel stove from which smoke will blow forever - a symbol of work, transformation and power. Something that in comparison the miserable explosion of a makeshift bomb will only be an infinitely imperfect tracing of… ourselves. An unsurpassed formula. The smell of burning coal will take this thought a long way. \n\nOkay, enough of this propaganda for today. I need a drink. But not too much, unfortunately. Tomorrow the "work" will be handed over..."

And this time as well. The street is boiling again. Fortunately, everyone has got used to the smell of burning. Nobody feels anything anymore, nobody sees anything.

It's easier to gather my thoughts when the next letters typed on the keyboard remain only the most ordinary letters. If there were something behind them, some… human… something… alive, it would be unpleasant.\n\nAnd so everything goes like a charm. The new book on the shelf practically writes itself. That's the way things should be done. Like a clockwork... Nothing is a problem when you approach it right. \n\nNothing..."
BBW_black_fever:0 "Black Fever"
BBW_black_fever_desc:0 "“It is absolutely true that coal is both a building material and a fuel on the basis of which a strong and prosperous country is created. There is no need to worry about smog or other crap when you can or even have to hit the ground with a shovel and get a guarantee of safety and power from it. Only a petty man feeds on fear.\n\nDespite the lack of machinery and the need to rely on manual labor, we are on the right track to achieving prosperity. Each hit in the ground will cause an avalanche of the next and the next, and black gold will flow to power plants, our homes and abroad for the benefit of all of us."\n\nRafał Ziemkiewicz once again looked at the content of the article he just sketched. After a while, he happily grabbed the glass of cognac. He took a deep sip of the amber liquid and grasped his chin thoughtfully over a piece of freshly written paper. "It's okay," he thought.

They don't like us, of course, but they all want lit streets, hot water taps and a working industry. An attack on us would be costly and would result in a loss of supply. Besides, there would be no end to the wars to take control of the power plant. Everyone would like to own it, and this could lead to chaos and destruction of the facility. So we need to sit down at the table and talk. The Bełchatów Railway Station is bursting at the seams with all kinds of materials sent as payment for electricity. It is not known how long this condition will last, I hope as long as possible."

BBW_the_power_of_steam_desc:0 "Although crucial, coal alone is not the only component of a healthy economy. Without steel, it is impossible to successfully extract it, fight other contenders for power or put houses in the place of ruins. Even though we do not have direct iron deposits, scrap metal around us is abundant. This is considered gross by some to recycle, but in fact it is a whole new production cycle. Our new American economics expert, Christian Paulson, believes so.\n\nAfter all, recycling is basically an individual activity, and here a large plant will be responsible for it. If its area formally covers all our dominion, then there will be no question of collecting garbage but only "using scattered warehouses of semi-finished materials"\n\nThat is why it was rightly recognized at the meeting of the Council that building a large steam scrap yard is a historic necessity. The Steam Combine "Citadel" will soon be operational. You can already see the smoke over Parzno, the blackest one can imagine.\n\nThousands of tons of steel each year ready to be turned into something useful..."

Thanks to the money for exports and skilful management, we managed to get the necessary materials. Soon, a narrow stream of energy flowing to the market will turn into real Yangtze. Chances are our "trading partners" won't be able to resist it.\n\nMoreover, together with the new unit, new plants will be built and those for which there was no capacity before, will be reopened as well. It's wonderful to be rich. Everyone will admit it. And the more wealth the better. Hence the new Council decision to allocate a portion of the money directly to the people. In the end, they deserved it, and the money released on the market will come back to us anyway. And that's the way it should be."

In other cities, people listened to CB radios, and where the Internet was still reaching, they were waiting impatiently for the next lines of the text of the report written by one of the scribes.\n\nDespite admonitions, some brought framed photos of the victims to the court. What happened in the very courtroom can only be described as pure chaos. Despite the instructions and frantic interventions of the guards, the crowd of spectators still raised angry cheers at the three inconspicuous teenagers. Two of them stared impassively at the accused's desk. Third one, the youngest, was staring aggressively towards the tribunal and at the onlookers every now and then, inciting them to further screams and threats. And so it went for several hours, until everyone, simply tired of the procedures began to listen to the accusations.\n\n At least until the chief prosecutor - High Paladin Tomasz Sommer - took the floor. Summoned by the tribunal, he had difficulty controlling his emotions while reading the findings of the investigative committee.\n- "The accused acted as part of an organized criminal group describing themselves as the "League of Environmental Defenders", planning, by means of terror, to overthrow the state apparatus and to bring about social changes in the spirit of misunderstood and radical nature protection..."\nWhen he was seated after a while, the tribunal was forced to interrupt the hearing and lead the accused and the spectators out.

These were letters full of particularly disturbing information. Finally, the chaotic discussion gave way to order, when the Scribe Stefan Janecki slammed his fist on the table so hard that a pile of old rubber boots collapsed near the tiled stove in the corner of the room. The guards frantically began putting it back together.\n\n- Dear Brothers, I don't think we have any doubts that this green plague is stronger than anyone might have previously suspected. By our inattention, we have brought up a bunch of ingrates and dreamers who, through their stupidity, can bring us all doom. A generation of parasites...\n\nSenior Paladin Witold Gadomski - Head of the Ministry of Economy, immediately raised his hand.\n\nExactly so! We have failed, we have handed over the younger generation and some of the old to eco-terrorists and climate liars! How did the Wiech's writings reached to the people?! We've slept well for too long and now we're going to bear the consequences. The attacks so far are only the beginning, for certain, and we will have the "Wiechowszczyzna". We must act. Scribe Janecki's department is already preparing proscription lists.\n\nThe said Chief of Intelligence nodded knowingly.\n\n- Excellent - replied paladin Łukasz Warzecha, Head of the Infrastructure Department.\n- Brothers, let us remember that many of our...fellow citizens are still faithful to good standards and if they found out what is really going on, they would support us with their body and soul. It would be good to use their enthusiasm.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Paladin Łukasz continued -\n\n- I think we have reached a consensus. Knight Krzysztof - announce the brown alarm. We are on the brink of a new era, and only a wretched group of green crooks is keeping us from embracing it.\n\nThe knight started throwing rubber boots into the tiled stove. After a while, brown smoke, discernible only to the eager eyes of the initiated brethren (it barely stood out against the gray-black sky), gave signal for a secret mobilization."

belchatow.5.desc:0 "Andrzej, Junior Knight of the Brotherhood, scratched his head in disbelief. It was already dawn and total darkness gave way to the semi-darkness typical of Bełchatów. You could easily see what happened at night. Most of the windows were broken and shards of glass rustled under the feet of the loitering passers-by. Each of them seemed to ignore the destruction. Only from time to time, some people stopped in front of the signs of radioactivity painted with green paint. After a while, Andrzej himself began to look at them curiously.\n\nThese symbols were found only on those buildings that had their doors torn off their hinges. The bystanders seemed to be pleased with the effects of the night's "riots"\n\n- Knight Andrzej! Get Your ass moving and working! I'm a Scribe, so i won't do your damn job for you! There is no time to enjoy the views.\n\nBut of course, Scribe Jakub, of course...\n\nA small detachment entered one of the most devastated buildings - a small apartment block. Andrzej clenched his sweaty hands on his SMG RAK. His working day has begun...\n\n\n***\n\nList of Suspects. Entry No. 120.\n\nAddress - REDACTED\n\nReporting Officer - Junior Scribe Jakub W.\n\n“First apartment - single marriage, suspected green media job before the Fall. Husband has 4 teeth knocked out and both legs broken. Wife with a black eye.\n\nSecond apartment - a family of five. Three teenagers included. Found green literature in the form of the book "Not Everything for a Dump". The book was burnt. The youth were arrested for interrogation and rehabilitation purposes. Parents under supervision.\n\nThird apartment - Lonely man. A bum. He performed prohibited recycling in the form of collecting cans for illegal purchase. Material evidence was confiscated. He resisted and attacked the unit. He was intoxicated. Junior Knight Andrzej neutralized him with a burst from SMG. Application for decoration sent to the council...""

belchatow.6.desc:0 "The bus - old, shabby Jelcz rocked mercilessly on the potholes. Its passengers, mostly youth from nearby schools, either tried to sleep off or looked at the landscape behind dirty windows, almost invisible due to the smog and late hours. A dozen or so of them, the entire newly established class from one of the Bełchatów high schools, clearly differed from the rest. They were huddled and scared, just staring blankly at the floor beneath their feet.\n\nAfter a while the bus slowed down and finally stopped in front of the metal gate. Passengers spilled outside at the sound of screams chasing them. They were lined up. Someone approached the freshmen with a submachine gun in his hand.\n\n- I am the Knight Mateusz and from today you are to speak to me in this way. And you will say everything that I ask you about. Understand?\n\n- Yes, sir! - answered the now-awakened freshmen\n\n- Good, due to the increased demand for coal, you have been mobilized to work in the mine. You will have excuses for school absences. Maybe they even increase Your behavior marks, he he. The case looks like this - 12 hours a day's work, and a half-hour break at 12:00. You will get some food. To the changing room - MARCH!\n\n- Yes, sir - freshmen replied sluggishly, and went where they were shown."

belchatow.7.desc:0 "A small squad of a Scribe and two Knights moved from block to block and from house to house. Every selected person, a moment after hearing the knock on the door, was already on the steam tram. There, they listened to the speeches of one of the Elder Knights or Junior Paladins about the need for immediate mobilization. The enemy is close, right outside our gates, and we must eradicate him.\n\nThe tram then traveled across town to the training base in the village of Kanada. This place had the reputation of a terrible murder-hole, but the conscripts knew that without pain, they would not ensure permanent economic growth. Once they got out, they were immediately brutally restrained and then shaved bald and stripped. Then, naked, they landed in the initiation room where, using a piece of coal, symbols were drawn on their bodies that they had to swear on - Mine, Lightning and the Black Steam. The fumes of burning fine coal put them in an ecstatic mood. They felt strong, ready to fulfill their historical role. Their mission had just begun..."

belchatow.8.desc:0 "Elder Scribe Ziemkiewicz sat alone in the cafeteria. It was late, those who could - were asleep and those who had to - worked. However, the Brotherhood's media representative did not know what to do with himself.\n\nHe just played with a fork stuck in a bowl of macaroni and cheese, mockingly known as spaghetti. He didn't know what to feel. Anger, fear, or maybe ... pride in the decision-making nature of the organization to which he belonged. He was fresh from the last meeting of the Council. He knew what was about to happen. He knew what would happen in this city and on this earth. His hands started shaking. The thought of a nip of cognac wrapped in the Brotherhood's robe (the council's latest idea) secretly flashed through his mind. He drank it all in one gulp. He calmed down. There is no way out. Must start writing. Tomorrow's announcement needs to be ready. As well as those for all the next days…."

belchatow.9.desc:0 ""Dear Brothers", Scribe Janecki began - "enough has been said about what will happen"\n\nScribe, Rafał Ziemkiewicz, involuntarily stroked the spine of his new book. The cover was thick and pleasantly tough. After the high-quality, suggestive visualization of the atomic bomb explosion, it was also clear that he wasn't skimping on first impressions of the readers...\n\n"We're ready," said the Brotherhood's Chief of Intelligence, then grabbed the Chief Scribe's book. Its cover showed a young man in a suit with a thick tangle of curly hair on his head. He flipped it through casually. Knowing its contents by heart, he was habitually looking for any inaccuracies. Of course, it was for nothing.\n\n"Paladin Rzymkowski", he said, without taking his eyes off the publication, "Get to it."\n\nWithout a word, the Chief of the Brotherhood's power departments stood to attention, saluted and marched out of the room. Soon after him, members of the Brotherhood's guard staff followed."

This name echoed angrily wherever the power of the Brotherhood reached and wherever the two-part book by scribe Ziemkiewicz - "Protocols of the Atomic Crusade" was distributed. The population cursed relentlessly at this madman who wanted to take their normality. After all, the terrorist organization created by Wiech planned to destroy the power plant and build in its place an extremely dangerous, recovered nuclear reactor, probably some kind of RBMK from Ukraine.\n\nCombining extreme religious fundamentalism, the ethos of the knightly order and green atomic fanaticism, they almost drove the lands of the Brotherhood into the darkness of the Middle Ages, illuminated only by the glow of murderous radioactive waste. The icing on the cake of their madness was the suicidal plan of §GHoly Green Revenge§! on Germany for the construction of Nord Stream 2.\n\nOnly the resolute attitude of the order forces of the Brotherhood saved us from this terrible fate. But the tentacles of "Wiechowszczyzna" go deeper than previously assumed. The Atomic Crusaders are among us and among our neighbors. They are just waiting for the moment of the Brotherhood's weakness to attack again. If we do not stop them, they will fool the masses, especially the naive youth, and implement their doomed plans."

Instructions on how to segregate rubbish, how to save water, how to combine various plant-based foods in the diet to effectively eliminate meat from it.\n\nTwo young people were bustling around the little cell. The woman was operating the printer. The man sorted the individual leaflets into piles. It was late, and there was only one window letting in the faint moonlight. Light bulbs were forbidden so as not to make the work of the Brotherhood spies easier. Suddenly, a barely audible murmur came from outside the door. The man stopped dead and quickly pulled the gun from his belt.\n\nSeeing this, the woman began to pour the spirit over the entire printing apparatus. In an instant, the door blew up. Smoke rose all around. Sounds of gunfire and footsteps of heavy boots ringed all around. The man was hit in the chest by a series of shots. He fell deafly between the pages, staining them with blood. The woman did not manage to pull the lighter out of the pants as she was butt-stroked on the head. She fell to the ground, was quickly handcuffed and taken outside. Inside, Paladin - the operational commander, with all his willpower avalaible kept himself from lighting a cigarette. He couldn't leave until he had the paperwork done. There was no time.

Suddenly, Brotherhood soldiers entered the room without knocking. All armed and armored. The teacher ordered the students to stand at attention. The commander of the newly arrived unit spoke. However, instead of talking to the students, he ordered his subordinates to search them. Crushed against their benches, they were silent as their backpacks and pockets were rummaged. Marijuana was quickly found - a green, unprocessed drug, and leaflets informing about the advantages of renewable energy over coal-based energy. All students, including those with no forbidden items, were transported to the Mine on the same day. There they were told that they had been sentenced to a month of community service. Shovels were handed out and put to work at gunpoint.\n\n\n "Listen to your pa' politely\nAnd you'll live quite profitably\nThere, you'll find in life happiness...""

She liked to sit on the couch to the sound of sizzling wood or coal and drink delicious tea. And sometimes even spiked tea. And so she did this time. A 100ml shot of "Brunatna" mixed with a decoction of nettles and sage. Elizabeth treated herself to a wonderful evening\n\n Suddenly, around 10 p.m., the fire in the fireplace suddenly went out. "Tired" Ela struggled to get up from the soft armchair and bent over the barely burning coals. After a short while, she noticed something long and gray among the ashes. She did not even have time to scream when the mysterious object flashed bright light with the deafening sound. Black-clad Brotherhood members burst into the house. They handcuffed the stunned Ela and began to brutally search the apartment. The book "Gardener's Guide" was quickly found. Commanding officer considered description of sunflower cultivation to be disguised propaganda about the propagation of solar energy.

Inside, apart from the frightened pupils of Tomaszów's primary schools, there were armed guards of the Brotherhood. The landscape outside was apocalyptic. The traces of fighting have not yet been removed, only one track at the Widzew station was passable. The rest were blown up. The blackened blocks of the nearby estate were marked with traces of artillery fire. After a short stop for the identification of passengers, the train continued, via Niciarniana towards Fabryczna.\n\n The beautiful station building miraculously survived the war, although in many places the glass roof was full of holes from bullets and explosions. The inhabitants of Łódź, recruited for work, were just cleaning shards of glass from the floor. The students were chased by the guards to the tram. The poorly installed boiler smoked the entire interior of the first car and the entire space around it. We could hear coughing through the sound of the locomotive and heavy breathing of passengers. After the mercilessly long ride, the tram stopped next to the former Manufaktura. Stretching further was only nuclear wasteland of Bałuty. The makeshift fence made of mesh and hollow bricks could not cover the gray-green sea of rubble. Then an agitator - a scribe of the Brotherhood - entered the rostrum by the fence.\n\n- Take a look. This is the result of the lies that green fascists, leftists and other lunatics have been pouring into your head. Here lies the culmination of all false progress - Atomic Destruction!\n\nLet me just remind you - it is thanks to carbon that you are here, it gives us real, stable strength.

A trembling adept, Ziemkiewicz's subordinate, ran inside. High Scribe, seeing him, got up with a groan and sat down on one of the chairs.\n\nThe adept handed him a piece of paper that looked to be some kind of report. Grabbing his head with one hand, Ziemkiewicz grabbed the letter and started reading. With each passing second, the blurry eyes regained their life. His hand dropped from his head.

POLITICS_RAFAL_ZIEMKIEWICZ_DESC:0 "Rafał Ziemkiewicz - (born September 14, 1964) - A journalist, writer, visionary and a man of common sense. Few are of more merit to the Brotherhood than it's elder and first scribe. When the country around was plunged into chaos, his person was uniting people around lasting survival and restoration of normality based on the technological superiority of coal energy and hierarchical order. Though his leadership is largely nominal, he is considered the most respected person of the Brotherhood. His books, widely popularized on Brotherhood territories after the Fall of Poland created a vision of new, better future – based on rough interests, on fighting against the dictate of green fascism and on opposition to ecologist EU. Despite initial fervor with which he helped organizing the Brotherhood and it’s state, he is more and more frequently asking himself – “do people really appreciate our efforts"?"
POLITICS_LUKASZ_WARZECHA_DESC:0 "Łukasz Warzecha, (born 1975, Łódź), elder of infrastructure and transport of Brotherhood. Before the Fall he worked as journalist a for the Do Rzeczy magazine, a forge of Brotherhood staff, where he fiercely defended gasoline cars and other fossil fuel vehicles as essential to achieve human compliance and technological progress. He was among the first who answered Ziemkiewicz's call, together with his followers. Their trucks and SUV-s significantly helped to take control over the Bełchatów area. Through the deficit of gasoline messed up the plans of motorizing the population he now focuses on establishing efficient, cheap and purely coal–based means of public transport, and as more and more steam trams glide across Brotherhood lands, he is slowly achieving success."
POLITICS_STANISLAW_JANECKI_DESC:0 "Stanisław Janecki – (born est. 1955) – The grey eminence of the Brotherhood and the elder responsible for gathering intelligence and handling state secrets hardly ever talks about his past. If so, he gives contradictory information, making even greater chaos around him. The scraps of data on the internet are being successfully removed by his resort. Nobody is better than Janecki in closing lips of inquisitive people and other Elders know about it, using his skills in finding and silencing any sign of threat to Brotherhood. But sometimes even they themselves wonder whether they know who Janecki really is..."
POLITICS_TOMASZ_RZYMKOWSKI_DESC:0 "Tomasz Rzymkowski – (born 13 July, 1986, Kutno) – a paladin and one of the youngest members of the Brotherhood elite. After the Fall he made use of his old contacts in the National Movement and he helped paladin Tomasz Sommer with organization of the Brotherhood military forces. He also created the system of indoctrination of the rookies which hails them as defenders of common sense fighting with the green scourge which massively boosted their morale. Later he worked as the Black Curator recarbonizing the core curriculum in schools. His closest subordinates are known as the most fanatical Brotherhood members, being under his ideological influence."
POLITICS_WITOLD_GADOMSKI_DESC:0 "Witold Gadomski – (born 16 June 1953, Pułtusk) – The Elder responsible for handling the economy is one of the most dubious Brotherhood elders. His past activity in „Gazeta Wyborcza”, a liberal newspaper where disastrous ecologist and green-aligned ideas flourished made him a very unlikely candidate to serve as Brotherhood staff. Surprisingly after he made use of his understatement of economy organization and he swore allegiance to Brotherhood ideas he proved his usefulness and dedication to the cause. Despite his deeply neoliberal beliefs, he accepts the usage of interventionist methods as necessary to ensure victory of Brotherhood and it’s values."
POLITICS_TOMASZ_SOMMER_DESC:0 "Tomasz Sommer (born 16 October 1972, Puławy) – If a foreigner is asking a Bełchatów citizen who's a hero, an ideal man and soldier, he will without a doubt hear as an answer the name and surname of the Paladin-in-chief. It was him who stood against every early threat to the Brotherhood, leading his fellow soldiers to victory after victory. His fierce attacks on Scouts, Hooligans and Dialogue followers often ended with bloody but successful results. Even elder Ziemkiewicz wrote a lot about them giving Sommer great fame and recognition. Now, when the paladin’s Black Opel Inignia drives along the Bełchatów streets many people are cheering and taking off their caps. Others are silent..."
