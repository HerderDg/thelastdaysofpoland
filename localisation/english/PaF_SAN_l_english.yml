unification.98.t: "[GetNewspaper]Sanation revisionists unify Podlasie"
unification.98.desc: "A breakthrough has finally been made in Northeastern Poland, as the Podlaskie voivodeship, which had descended into a particularly chaotic warlord era following the Fall, now stands unified by a single government. The “New Sanation”, based on the principles of the 1926-1939 government of the Second Polish Republic and the beliefs of Józef Piłsudski, has triumphed over all regional contenders and bandits, granting them legitimacy in the eyes of the people. Though they benefit from their rather large supporter base’s nostalgia and the gravitas of the national heroes whose legacy they uphold, the movement, just like its predecessor, is plagued by division and diplomatic isolation. These obstacles may heavily hinder the Sanation’s attempts at complete reunification, but their methods, although old-fashioned, aren’t necessarily doomed to fail – they have worked before after all. The real question is, will the people of Poland trust them again?"
