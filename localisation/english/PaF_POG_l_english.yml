krosniewice.1002.t: "Paramedics take over Consortium"
krosniewice.1002.desc: "The elusive leader of the privatized division of Łódź Paramedics has finally decided to step out of the shadows and assume his position as the new face of the Consortium. Little is known about the mysterious Dr. Ebrantil, besides the rumors of his cooperation with Skrzydlewski go back to long before the Fall. His spokesmen claim that the Paramedics acquired the dominant position thanks to their innovativeness and a shrewd use of resources that were amassed before the Fall. Their business plan, whilst shrouded in mystery, shall continue under their watchful eye.\nSome people accuse Ebrantil of being the perpetrator of the infamous Skin Hunter scandal, who will only expand his nefarious schemes as time goes on. Such voices are quickly silenced by bribery, lawsuits or... other means."
krosniewice.1002.a: "Iatrophobia Personified"
 

unification.35.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Łódź Medical Service unifies the Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.35.desc: "For a long time, Łódź remained one of the few regions not engulfed in constant war, with the local cliques instead taking to the bargaining table to investigate the mysterious nuclear explosion in Bałuty. It seems like cooperation turned out for the better for Łodzian power players, as the region has just got united by a union of three factions working in symbiosis with each other. \nThe so-called 'Flower Consortium' is a triumvirate of Krzysztof Rutkowski, H. Skrzydlewska, and the Łódź Emergency Medical Service, which now runs most of pre-Fall civil services and deals with the state's administration. We have, however, also received reports that the Medical Service is, in fact, the Consortium's shadow hand that serves as it's espionage wing and secret police, deals with it's wetwork and handles the clique's black market connections as well. The population of Łódź seems oblivious to this fact, however, thanks to the Triumvirate's control over the information that reaches it's people."
unification.35.a: "I knew they did something to my normal pills lately."

super.35.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.35.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.35.a: "United at last."

POLITICS_EBRANTIL_DESC: "A horrifying revelation awaits anyone who dares to venture deep into the Flower Consortium’s politics. Despite Skrzydlewski’s appearance of control, the true power lies within the hands of a man so wicked, the potential revelation of the depths of his depravity might just prove enough to unify all the other warlords in an effort to contain him. Hidden behind a mask of flesh, the twisted expression of Dr. Ebrantil haunts Poland, as the terror once seen in the dying eyes of his patients spreads across Łódź, his influence corrupting the Emergency Services from the selfless humanitarians of days gone by into his personal playground, a shadow government in the halls of power and heartless killers on the streets of Kutno. \n\nUnbeknownst to the docile §Rlab rats§!, known in the rest of the voivodeship simply as §G“people”§!, the roots of the carousel of horror engulfing the fallen nation stretch all the way to the founding of the Third Republic. It was then, during his days as an EMS trainee, that a previously unassuming man realized he was... different than the rest of his classmates. He scoffed at their bleeding hearts, their will to do anything to save the life of another. He would still begrudgingly perform his work, of course, anything for the money after all, and the story could have very well ended here had he not found his enabler. Just like today, Witold Skrzydlewski’s cash flow would graciously unleash Dr. Ebrantil’s madness on the populace. As they died in the Pavulon-induced agony, staring into their future leader's soulless eyes, Łódź’s helpless benevolently served the interests of the two men for the final time, a source of profit for one, of twisted purpose for the other. \n\nWhen he invited the mad scientist under his wing for the second time, Skrzydlewski truly believed he could control Dr. Ebrantil. Instead, he would find himself the puppet of a demon in human skin. The necropolis of Kutno churns more and more bodies each day, some for gruesome experiments that create unholy amalgamations, others for their precious §Rblood§!, the rest simply for the new leader’s sick pleasure. There is nobody left to curtail his deranged mind.  \n\n§RNot even God can save Poland now.  \n\nThe people can only pray for a quick and painless death.§!"
