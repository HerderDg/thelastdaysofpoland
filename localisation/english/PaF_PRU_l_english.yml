unification.95.desc:0 "An unexpected outcome has arrived from north-eastern Poland as (semi) famous artist Ola Turkiewicz consolidated her rule over the territories of the Voivodeship of Warmińsko-Mazurskie.\nOla openly advocates for a Prussian state centralized upon the cultures of old Pagan communities that inhabited the area before their conquest at the hands of the Teutonic Order. \n \n The newly created state is quite unstable as it tries to gain legitimacy within Polish local communities and lead to a "Baltic revival" which according to her would "erase the consequences of Polish, German, and Russian sins upon the people of the Pagan Baltic".\n\nMany people still question the legitimacy of the state's existence but whether they like it or not, the state shall for now remain."
