POLITICS_OLA_TURKIEWICZ_DESC: "Ola Turkiewicz - vocalist, compositor, festival organizer, and as of recently, the leader of the neo-baltic warband that has taken over the south of Masuria. Her decision to carve out a state for the Baltic people was mainly influenced by her belief in 'Pruthenian Restorationism' which advocates for the revival of the many cultures wiped out by Teutons and Poles. \n \n Though she managed to conquer a state for herself, her hardest trial has just begun as the task of establishing a functional country biased on such a controversial idea and protecting it from invaders now lies on her shoulders. She surely has the complete and utter support of the Prussians, Yatvingians, Warmians, and Masurians, but will those small isolated societies of few thousands be enough for her to compete with the massive pushback from Polish nationalists? In fact, not only are die-hard nationalists her enemies, the idea of establishing a non-polish state on Polish-soil isn't popular with.....anyone. \n \n As the curtain to peaceful coexistence is slowly falling Ola will have to contend with the responsibility of carrying the people she swore to protect through the following chaos of war, and with the possibility of failure the Baltic people might suffer the same fate they suffered hundreds of years ago."

unification.95.desc: "A rather unexpected outcome has occurred in North-Eastern Poland as (semi) famous artist Ola Turkiewicz has consolidated her rule over the territories of the former Warmian-Masurian voivodeship.\nKnown for her long-standing appreciation of the culture, Turkiewicz openly advocates for a Prussian state centered upon the cultures of the old Pagan communities that inhabited the area before their conquest at the hands of the Teutonic Order.\n\nThe newly founded state is still relatively unstable, attempting to gain legitimacy among local communities while simultaneously advocating for a "Baltic revival" which would supposedly 'erase the consequences of Polish, German, and Russian sins upon the people of the Pagan Baltic.' \n\nWhile many continue to question this claim of historical retribution, whether they like it or not, the state shall remain, for now..."
