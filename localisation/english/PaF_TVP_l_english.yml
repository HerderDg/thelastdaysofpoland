unification.119.t: "[GetNewspaper]TVP unifies the Capital District!"
unification.119.desc: "Every channel, every frequency, and every print house across the Capital District spouts the same news in the same flagrant tone - Jacek Kurski, chairman of TVP, has managed to rally the people to his patriotic message of reclaiming the nation from all its ills and depravity. Sensational news and an endless stream of propaganda are seemingly all that escapes the glass spires of Woronicza 17, as all reports point to Warsaw falling under the sole and undivided control of the state television company. Broadcasts of slanderous and rousing hit pieces, interspersed only by Turkish melodramas and cooking shows, have filled many citizens of the capital with a patriotic and equal parts hateful zealotry, driving them to readily live and die in the name of reclaiming Poland from its literal and moral devastation. Every home, even those without running water, will soon be able to hear the truth they were not privy to for all too long."
unification.119.a: "Come get your free TVs!"

super.119.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.119.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.119.a: "United at last."
