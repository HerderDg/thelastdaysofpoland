POLITICS_SPEEREK_DESC: "...Albert Speer? ...W-what do you mean, ''Albert Speer''? What, the Nazi minister and architect? What about him?\n\n...He's here? You're saying he's here? Talking with us? \n\n*sigh* \n\nRequest to administer another dose... yes, and two more pills. Thank you.\n\n\n\nAlright, listen buddy, I'll be blunt: *THERE IS NO ALBERT SPEER*. He's long gone. Has been for the past 50 years. \nThere is no TNO either. It's just a figment of your imagination. An outlandish alternate universe you've made up inside your head. There's no ''Atlantropas'', ''funny desk events'', ''Ultravisionary space programmes'' and whatever other ''Speer- and Yagoda-themed blueberry homogenized cheese'' you've been rambling about to yourself when staring blankly into nearby walls. They're not here. They're not anywhere. They just don't exist. They never did in the first place. \n\nC'mon, it's time for you to bring your head out of clouds and get a grip on reality. Please swallow your pills and be a good boy. \nOkay?"
