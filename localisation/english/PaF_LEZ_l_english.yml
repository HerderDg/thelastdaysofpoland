 unification.186.t: "[GetNewspaper]Leżajsk Monarchists unify Subcarpathia!"
 unification.186.desc: "In the new Poland, power is taken, not inherited, and in Leżajsk, a man waits for a coronation that may never come. Leszek Wierzchowski, appointed Regent of the Polish Monarchist Movement, has done what few thought to be possible - united the entirety of Subcarpathia under his rule. Though he may be victorious, there is neither a king nor a dynasty, only a warlord draped in royal aspirations. And despite the pretensions of his many titles, none of them are as real as the rifles that helped him conquer the voivodeship. Wierzchowski's followers speak of restoration, of tradition reborn, but their banners fly over a land held together by force, not divine right. The roads are patrolled by militias, the laws are executed by clerks in an arbitrary manner, and the dream of a monarchy remains just that - still a distant dream. Who will be the man that Subcarpathia kneels to - a king or simply the strongest man in the room?"
 unification.186.a: "They may have some problems with the candidates..."
