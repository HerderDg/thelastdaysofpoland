 unification.186.t: "[GetNewspaper]A Throne Without a Crown"
 unification.186.desc: "In the new Poland, power is taken, not inherited. In Leżajsk, a man waits for a coronation that may never come. Leszek Wierzchowski, appointed Regent of the Polish Monarchist Movement, has done what few thought possible - he has united Subcarpathia under his rule. Though he’s victorious, there is no king, no dynasty, only a warlord draped in royal aspirations. And despite his many titles, there is nothing as real as the rifles that helped him conquer this voivodeship. His followers speak of restoration, of tradition reborn, but their banners fly over a land held together by force, not divine right. Roads are patrolled by militias, laws are executed by clerks in a random manner, and the dream of monarchy remains just that - still a distant dream. Who will be the man that Subcarpathia kneels to; a king, or simply the strongest man in the room?"
 unification.186.a: "They may have some problems with candidates..."
