unification.41.t: "[GetNewspaper]Myślenice Military District unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.41.desc: "When order collapsed in Poland, few expected a meaningful force to emerge out of Lesser Poland. Isolated from the rest of Małopolskie, only a constant effort from local warlords prevented the region from falling into anarchy. Reliant purely on local resources, however, they quickly found themselves swept away by the only organized military unit within the area. Remnants of the 11th territorial defense brigade of the old voivodeship under corporal Goncerz established themselves in the city of Myślenice, using it as a base of operations for their further plans. And those, they meticulously executed, asserting full control over the mountainous region. Old factories are now being repurposed for military production, as new guns, shells, and uniforms are being constantly added to the army. With the unit growing stronger with each passing day, it's not a question of if, but when they choose to strike out once more."
unification.41.a: "A new military-industrial complex is born"
