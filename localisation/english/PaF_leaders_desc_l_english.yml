 POLITICS_WLODZIMIERZ_CZARZASTY_DESC:0 "These were not good years for the left-wing parties. The growth of Law and Justice's power has significantly limited the possibilities of an effective democratic campaign, mainly due to a series of persecutions against left-wing politicians and their electorate. The relentless obstruction of life by law enforcement became one of the many reasons why the Left finally said enough. Radicalized groups of socialist militias began to form throughout the country, ranging from the vandalization of monuments to attempt the bomb attack on Nowogrodzka Street. During the days before The Fall, Włodzimierz Czarzasty managed to escape capital but found himself in an uncomfortable position as persona non grata. The EU intervention and the total disintegration of the Polish government did not surprise Czarzasty, but the nightmare that followed was not comparable to the most pessimistic scenarios. Czarzasty quickly organized a substitute administration in Sosnowiec and proclaimed the Republic of Zagłębie. The provisional apparatus of power stretched across the entire Dąbrowa Basin, from Czeladź to Dąbrowa Górnicza and Jaworzno. The left-wing Polish Committee of National Liberation, which was established, had several problems. In his search for allies who would support Czarzasty's dreams of maintaining power, he turned to the two largest factions in Zagłębie: communists from Dąbrowa Górnicza and anti-fascists from Jaworzno, creating a alliance of Międzypowiatówka. It is not hard to guess that the cracks in the common front of the left began to appear almost immediately, which resulted in the granting of broad autonomy to these two factions. Now it is only up to Włodzimierz Czarzasty whether Międzypowiatówka will survive as one or another civil war will break out, drowning the region in blood once again."
 POLITICS_ANDRZEJ_SAPKOWSKI_DESC:0 "Andrzej Sapkowski (born 21 June 1948) - A popular writer, best known for his "Witcher" book series. After the collapse of Polish state he gathered loyal fans and fouded his own faction in the city of Skierniewice mainly as a way of protecting himself in these chaotic times. To keep morale of fantasy fanatics up, he decided to stylise his faction in an image of the Witcher world he created. At least that's what the cynics say, as it is also possible that the old writer has gone compeletely mad and his duchy is not a mere masquerade, but a genuine attempt to create a truly Temerian realm. Truth may never be revealed as the "duke" rarely speaks in public and when he does his ellusive answers and dry sense of humor make it really hard to figure out what's actually on his mind."
 POLITICS_JACEK_BARTYZEL_DESC:0 "Jacek Bartyzel (born 16 January 1956) - A publicist, social activist and a professor at university known for his radical conservatism and advocacy for monarchism.

Situation got worse for him, when Andrzej Sapkowski arrived in the area. Thee writer gained wide support thanks to his fame, while the number of Bartyzel's supporters was dwindling every day. Realising, his faction won't survive on his own, he sweared fealty to duke Sapkowski, promising his faithful service in exchange for the autonomous rule of newly formed county of Łowicz. Even though he views the Duchy of Velen as a farse, he can't deny that Sapkowski's regime is the only monarchical government, that gained traction in the lands of post-Fall Łódź provine and because of that, he will work with Sapkowski as long as the duke respects his right to autonomous rule."

While he had his disagreements with his father in certain political matters, he nevertheless offered him his help in governing the county of Łowicz and later he kept public support at high levels during his father's rebellion.

While he had never contested the legitimacy of the Burbon line currently ruling in Spain, he decided to accept the offer of Legitimist Regency Council of Poland and become a new king of soon-to-be unified kingdom. While he's not uccostomed to brutal reality of post-Fall Poland and can't communicate with his subject due to his unfamiliarity with local language, his rise to power is believed to be the only for truly virtuous government in the Polish lands."

Few are of more merit to the Brotherhood than it's elder and first scribe. When the country around was plunged into chaos, his person was uniting people around lasting survival and restoration of normality based on the technological superiority of coal energy and hierarchical order. Though his leadership is largely nominal, he is considered the most respected person of the Brotherhood. His books, widely popularized on Brotherhood territories after the Fall of Poland created a vision of new, better future – based on rough interests, on fighting against the dictate of green fascism and on opposition to ecologist EU. Despite initial fervor with which he helped organizing the Brotherhood and it’s state, he is more and more frequently asking himself – “do people really appreciate our efforts"?"

After the Collapse, the Orthodox Lemko administration invited archbishop Martyniuk, who at the time was in Gorlice, to lead the fledgling state, much to the dismay of the Greek and Roman Catholic populace in the region. Though taken by surprise, as he is not a Lemko himself, Paisios agreed, seeing the decision as a sign from God. He faces strong opposition from the non-Orthodox Lemkos and Poles, who view him as a despotic theocrat. Archbishop Martyniuk, however, is not as ruthless as his opposition seems to believe. He wishes for nothing but peace for all of his subjects, only aiming to solve the issues at hand before a more permanent leader can be found. The deep divide within the Lemko society may however prove too challenging for His Eminence. Nothing short of a miracle could bring lasting unity to the young state."

It was him who stood against every early thread to the Brotherhood, leading his fellow soldiers to victory after victory. His fierce attacks on Scouts, Hooligans and Dialogue followers often ended with bloody but successful results. Even elder Ziemkiewicz wrote a lot about them giving Sommer a great fame and recognizability.

His past activity in „Gazeta Wyborcza”, a liberal newspaper where disastrous ecologist and greenish ideas flourished made him a very unlikely candidate to Brotherhood staff.

 POLITICS_PRZEMYSLAW_CZARNEK_DESC:0 "The cultural Marxism has infiltrated Poland. European neo-Bolshevism, LGBT deviancy, spineless atheism, Western so called \”progressivism\” and \”liberalism\” – they are all trying to destroy the very foundations of our nation and society. They want to indoctrinate our children, dismantle the natural, traditional model of the family, erase our proud history, and make us abandon Christ and His teachings. In these dire times, only one man still has the courage to oppose these evil forces.\n\nPrzemysław Czarnek has been warning the Polish people for many years. As a KUL professor, as a Lublinian voivode, then as a Minister of Education, and later as a deputy Prime Minister of Poland. And yet people wouldn’t listen. He has been ridiculed, despised, protested against. But he never lost faith in his mission. He stood firm in the defense of Polish and Christian values. And when the next step of leftist plan succeeded and Polish state has fallen apart, he knew that his mission became more important than ever.\n\nHe managed to secure and alliance of convenience with two somewhat influential Lublinian \”rightists\”, and with their combined forces they were able to gain control of the large part of Lublin voivodeship, including its capital. This newfound power called National Front was ready to keep expanding in their quest of bringing the Polish society back to their Christian roots, but instantly the cracks have begun to show. In a predictable turn of events the primitive fascist brute and the crazy Protestant cult leader have proved themselves to be as vile as everyone else, and soon they betrayed him in a miserable attempt to gain as much personal power as they can.\n\nThe Front lies fractured. Czarnek couldn’t stop neither their secession in the North and South, nor the anarchist uprising in the East, which even spread to a large part of Lublin. However, while he lost most of the territory, he finally gained actual control. Only now he is able to fully implement his Catholic policies, free from squabble of his former allies. The real crusade for Polish soul begins now, and as Czarnek never lost faith in his mission before, he doesn’t intend to do it today."
 POLITICS_KRZYSZTOF_ZUK_DESC:0 "When chaos and anarchy was spreading all over Poland, initally it seemed like the city of Lublin had a chance to remain a relatively safe and stable place. Krzysztof Żuk, who has been its mayor all the way back since 2010, has managed to rally enough support to hold onto his power during the first wave of widespread violent riots, and became commonly recognized as a unifying symbol of stability and moderation among people of varying political alignments. For a few weeks, things have seemed to be not as bad as they could have been.\n\nUnfortunately, this wouldn’t last. The newfound right-wing regional power of National Front eventually managed to coup Żuk and forced him to flee the city. He ran eastwards, away from the territory controlled by the Front, and reached Krasnystaw – the town he was born in. There he decided that his fight wasn’t over yet.\n\nHowever dire the situation was, he wasn’t alone. Along with him most of his local government was forced out of Lublin, and soon he got in contact with many of its members and founded an organization which was to retake the city and stop the tyranny of the nationalists. He was joined by hundreds of Lublinians loyal to him and his cause, a number which only grew as he managed to steadily increase his influence in the anarchy of Eastern Lubelszczyzna, promising to bring freedom and stability to all of his clique’s citizens. He even managed to capture Chełm – voivodeship’s second largest city, and moved his new government there.\n\nAnd while Żuk’s power was growing, the Front was being crippled by internal conflicts, individual ambitions of its leaders and unrest among the population. Eventually the short-lived alliance of its power-hungry founders has inevitably fallen apart, and the Front has been fractured into several weak cliques, and was even partially consumed by an anarchist uprising. Now while we may not be ready yet to retake our city and free the people from tyranny, that day is rapidly aproaching, and hopefully things may start to seem normal again soon."

The latter he accepted with the hope that it would wipe clean his stain on the honor. Even so, his name was still a symbol of mediocrity in Poland. However, the Truskolasy, where he had arrived after the Fall, severely regretted this carelessness. With the help of the militias of the teams that came with him, he overthrew the remnants of the former administration, and appointed the ZWKT with himself as the Supreme Coach. People are now forming clubs where they eat, drink, work and exercise to develop their football skills. There is no room for lollygagging and the two biggest crimes of thought - peszkism (hedonism and alcoholism) and nawalkism (corruption, lies, lack of ideology and shallowness). Former coaches were erased from the books and especially one who destroyed polish football most - The Portuguese. Everyone else were descripted as a spirit-lacking lackeys of Polish Association, which in fact was to blame for everything wrong that happened to Brzęczek's life. \n\n But that will change, and the Supreme Coach will carry us to victory with his iron hand! \n\n Brothers and Sisters, march to the field!

He returned to his hometown, Wisła, wishing to survive the coming storm in peace. However, he quickly gave up on the retirement because there was an opportunity to save his own neighborhood from a fire that was consuming the whole country. Małysz joined the newly formed Council of Provisional Government of the Podbeskidzie Republic as one of the advisers and social representatives. He hoped, even if only to a small extent, to contribute to the survival of democracy in Poland. The peace, however, did not last forever as the president of the Republic of Podbeskidzie, Jerzy Buzek, died after a short illness. Council has plunged into chaos, and the Golec brothers unexpectedly took power, forcibly entering the town hall in Bielsko-Biała and together with the local law enforcement forces decided to arrest all other members of the Council. Małysz managed to escape only because the guard was a huge fan of him, which made convincing him to let Małysz go as easy as a roll with a banana. Adam rushed first to Wisła, and then to Cieszyn, warning everyone about a coup d'état. The Golec brothers, learning about this betrayal, broke at least one trombone and two trumpets. Now the drums of war are heard louder and louder at the borders of the Cieszyn county. The only consolation are trucks with humanitarian aid coming from the Czech border.However, is it enough for the last man of freedom in the region to emerge victorious?"
