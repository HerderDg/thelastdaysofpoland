 POLITICS_ANDRZEJ_SAPKOWSKI_DESC:0 "Andrzej Sapkowski (born 21 June 1948) - A popular writer, best known for his "Witcher" book series. After the collapse of Polish state he gathered loyal fans and fouded his own faction in the city of Skierniewice mainly as a way of protecting himself in these chaotic times. To keep morale of fantasy fanatics up, he decided to stylise his faction in an image of the Witcher world he created. At least that's what the cynics say, as it is also possible that the old writer has gone compeletely mad and his duchy is not a mere masquerade, but a genuine attempt to create a truly Temerian realm. Truth may never be revealed as the "duke" rarely speaks in public and when he does his ellusive answers and dry sense of humor make it really hard to figure out what's actually on his mind."

Situation got worse for him, when Andrzej Sapkowski arrived in the area. Thee writer gained wide support thanks to his fame, while the number of Bartyzel's supporters was dwindling every day. Realising, his faction won't survive on his own, he sweared fealty to duke Sapkowski, promising his faithful service in exchange for the autonomous rule of newly formed county of Łowicz. Even though he views the Duchy of Velen as a farse, he can't deny that Sapkowski's regime is the only monarchical government, that gained traction in the lands of post-Fall Łódź provine and because of that, he will work with Sapkowski as long as the duke respects his right to autonomous rule."

While he had his disagreements with his father in certain political matters, he nevertheless offered him his help in governing the county of Łowicz and later he kept public support at high levels during his father's rebellion.

Few are of more merit to the Brotherhood than it's elder and first scribe. When the country around was plunged into chaos, his person was uniting people around lasting survival and restoration of normality based on the technological superiority of coal energy and hierarchical order. Though his leadership is largely nominal, he is considered the most respected person of the Brotherhood. His books, widely popularized on Brotherhood territories after the Fall of Poland created a vision of new, better future – based on rough interests, on fighting against the dictate of green fascism and on opposition to ecologist EU. Despite initial fervor with which he helped organizing the Brotherhood and it’s state, he is more and more frequently asking himself – “do people really appreciate our efforts"?"
