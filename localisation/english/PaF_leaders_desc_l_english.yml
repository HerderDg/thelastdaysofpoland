After the collapse of Polish state he gathered loyal fans and fouded his own faction in the city of Skierniewice mainly as a way of protecting himself in these chaotic times. To keep morale of fantasy fanatics up, he decided to stylise his faction in an image of the Witcher world he created. At least that's what the cynics say, as it is also possible that the old writer has gone compeletely mad and his duchy is not a mere masquerade, but a genuine attempt to create a truly Temerian realm. Truth may never be revealed as the "duke" rarely speaks in public and when he does his ellusive answers and dry sense of humor make it really hard to figure out what's actually on his mind."
