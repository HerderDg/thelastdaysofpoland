GSW_outgunned: "Outgunned, Outmanned..."
GSW_outgunned_desc: "The Świecie Garrison is not a single formation within the Command's structures, but rather a collection of local units, training bases, and logistics centers hastily reorganized under Colonel Dyk's leadership. General Adamczak's disregard for the growing civilian unrest ensured that no contingency plans could be drawn up before the insurgency. As such, the Garrison fights with whatever weapons could be pulled from local stockpiles, whatever soldiers could be thrown into a state of combat readiness, following whatever uncoordinated orders the General Staff issues this time based on the unreliable intel coming in from the constantly retreating forward positions. Only a tactical mastermind would be able to salvage this situation. Colonel Dyk does not appear to have that spark."

GSW_tourniquet: "The Vistulan Tourniquet"
GSW_tourniquet_desc: "The partisans' first strike practically severed the two banks of the Vistula. The bridges have been blown up, comms disrupted, and the riverbank remains heavily patrolled to prevent anyone from sneaking in. The usual supply routes have been cut, forcing us to rely solely on the unprepared local stockpiles, while the Command is too busy licking its wounds to send any considerable relief force to break the blockade. Every few hours, the Garrison relays increasingly dire reports to the Central Command, begging for an intervention that would restore the logistical blood flow. The silence on the other side only escalates the gnawing feeling that it might never come."
