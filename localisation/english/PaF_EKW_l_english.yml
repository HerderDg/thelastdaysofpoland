POLITICS_DONALD_TUSK_DESC:0 "What was it all for? Dla Polski? Surely he hadn’t made things here better. Für Deutschland? All he did was tie ball and chain to its legs. Pour l’Europe? Isn’t its unity a mockery now? \n\nDonald Tusk would think himself as a descendant of Charlemagne and Napoleon – a humble one, but a descendant nonetheless. His impulse to strive to become the helmsman of European unity were his mixed Kashubian-Polish-German orgins, his obstacle – Poland. Grounded in country with one foot outside of Europe, he tried all his life to place them both firmly on the grounds of liberty, democracy and tolerance – first as an liberal oppositionist, then as the Civic Platform leader, a prime minister, a President of the European Council, finally as the providential man of anti-PiS opposition. Only when the crisis loomed large, he found his weapon, liberalism, rusty and in need of reforging. But it was too late. He failed. \n\nTusk was considered by Brussels and Berlin to be an ideal leader for Poland brought forcefully to European fold. At home among strangers, he became a stranger among his own. A Wallenrod at best, a Judas and Antichrist at worst, he can’t count on any support from the indigenous population. His authority stems from German tanks’ barrels, and thus he finally became the man he was potrayed by PiS: a marionette enforcer of the Eurofascist despotism. \n\nAll is not lost however. Despite all and everything, Tusk is still Polish – even if no one, including himself, would like him to be. He has been tied for life to this abnormal land. Time will tell if his ambitions will suffice to transform it."
