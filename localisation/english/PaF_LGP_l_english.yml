unification.135.t: "[GetNewspaper]Polish Legion unifies Subcarpathia!"
unification.135.desc: "No longer will Ukraine defile Poland’s rightful soil. Even in its chaos, the battered nation refuses to kneel. This defiance against foreign aggression is spearheaded by the forces of the Polish Legion, with Adam Słomka at its’ helm. Formed as a partisan force to protect the populace against the crimes of the UPA, the organization quickly proved its worth in local skirmishes. Inspiring a general rebellion centered in the town of Sieniawa, the Legion found itself battling, and somehow winning, against a seemingly overwhelming invasion force. With the region once again in Polish hands, the army has now fulfilled its original purpose. An identity crisis now wrangles the organization, with factions attempting to pull the politics of the state in every direction, as institutions of governance are hurriedly being established. So far Słomka’s presence unites the Legion, but how long can this status quo last?"
