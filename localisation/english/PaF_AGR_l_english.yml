unification.105.t: "[GetNewspaper]Agrounion unifies Podlachia!"
unification.105.desc: "Rumors emerging from Podlachia have come into the spotlight in recent weeks after Agrounion's victory in the thus-chaotic region. With borders not nearly as solidified as other parts of the shattered nation, the voivodeship had been marred by near-constant conflict, allowing the largely untested force to sweep in once war finally came knocking on its doorstep. Though the faction's previous falling out with its ally in Siedlce, which led to a brutal dismantlement of the Popular Front, caused most critics to doubt whether the Agrounion would be able to hold its own against the might of Podlachia, a wave of unprecedented popular support has allowed Kołodziejczak's forces to defeat their worn out opponents and claim hegemony over the area. Already, wide-sweeping agrarian reforms have been planned by the victors, promising great benefits and conditions for the region's bereaved farmers. Podlachia can breathe freely as peace seems to have finally reached its borders."
