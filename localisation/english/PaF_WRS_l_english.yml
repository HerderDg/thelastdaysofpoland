unification.158.t: "[GetNewspaper]Free City of Warsaw unifies the Capital District!"
unification.158.desc: "Inexpected news come from the capital of now defunt Polish state. It seems like the left-wing faction comprised of urban activists, liberal socialists and socialdemocrats, known as the Free City of Warsaw, seized control over the whole metropolis. While the alliance always seemed unstable, it is now united under firm guidance of left-wing columnist, activist and writer Jan Śpiewak. \n\nBased on democratic and anticapitalist principles, Free City of Warsaw has enjoyed a degree of support from middle-class denizens of Warsaw even before the Fall. Its ideological course has not drifted far away since, but it methods have been radicalised. It is rumored that the real estate market has been put under strict control, and whatever repressions are made against those violating these regulations are executed rather brazenly. Moreover, alcohol and gasoline sale is being heavily restricted on the grounds of public hygiene, with some advocating even for full prohibition \n\nTime will tell if the new government of capital will be able to withstand the pressure from other contenders for country unification, and for how long."
