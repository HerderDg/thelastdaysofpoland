With the sound of sirens resonating through the tranquil villages and raised banners fluttering in the pristine air, volunteer firefighters from Kraków to Tarnów have united under a single cause - protecting the land, its people, and the fundamental values of National Agrarianism. This momentous unification, marked by a ceremonial grand assembly, cements the brigades' commitment to safeguarding both rural and urban communities. Rooted in the ideals of hard work, solidarity, and self-sufficiency, the People's Fire Brigades pledge to not only combat flames but also foster a society where agriculture, tradition, and communal spirit thrive. From village barns to city streets, the flames of chaos shall be extinguished, and the fires of unity shall burn ever brighter. Lesser Poland now stands strong, defended by those who serve with honor."
