POLITICS_WACLAW_DEPO_DESC: "At the helm of a city most holy, Poland’s Jerusalem, the unchanging watch of Archbishop Wacław Depo continues, even as chaos engulfs the country on all sides of his domain. While today his custodianship of Jasna Góra is simply a fact entrenched in the daily life of Częstochowa’s faithful, the cleric’s journey to these sacred lands has been a lengthy one, a slow rise through the ranks of the Church over the span of numerous decades until at last a papal decree would end up appointing him a new home fit for his devotion. Ever since then, Depo has served the Black Madonna resolutely, overseeing droves of faithful as they came to seek her divine protection. And in the time of crisis, those same people he preached to from the Basilica’s altar turned to him in unison, proclaiming him the city’s savior. \n\nUnlike the majority of the country, despite the civil government’s dissolution, little has changed in Częstochowa following the collapse, for both better and worse. Ruling the city in adherence to his religious values, Depo seems content to turn the state inwards, ensuring the ever-swelling population of pilgrims seeking protection in the arms of the Church is provided for, the archbishop’s peaceful approach to politics transforming the city into a rock of stability in an otherwise shattered region. And while on the surface he enjoys his underlings’ full support, murmurs of unease slowly rise, as the window to assert divine supremacy over the destitute Zagłębie closes under Depo’s passive guard. \n\nAs the Archbishop’s §Rhealth worsens§!, the various factions of the church jostle for influence over the conclave, even as the ailing priest expends his remaining strength in an attempt to maintain a sense of control and normalcy. So far, all his efforts at reining in the vultures have been for naught, a regret he might just have to carry over into the afterlife. Soon, the Lord will greet his faithful servant in heaven, and when that day comes, Częstochowa will find itself in need of another guardian. The hill of Jasna Góra is only big enough for one king, and with the Madonna’s guidance, Depo’s successor will usher in §Ya new era of religious revival, a Poland true to its catholic roots§!."

unification.18.t: "[GetNewspaper]Częstochowa unifies Zagłębie and Jura!"
unification.18.desc: "God is merciful indeed. It would seem that after the death of Archbishop Depo, the stability of Częstochowa would fall and Jasna Góra would be pecked by ravens and crows. By the will of God, however, a new force has emerged that has taken power peacefully, which is an exception in this torn country. [CCH.GetLeader] is now the leader of the most enlightened and iconic church faction, which united Jura and Zagłębie, once again eradicating atheistic communism from these lands, under the protection of the Mother of God. Only the strength of God can conquer, and with him by their side, they will be undefeated.\nHowever, these are all official transmissions from Jasna Góra. The situation looks a lot more complicated than that. Because does the suffering of millions of people in a country forgotten by God also belong to this great plan of the Lord? There are many who will disagree and only time will tell if [CCH.GetRulingPartyLong] is up to their challenge."
