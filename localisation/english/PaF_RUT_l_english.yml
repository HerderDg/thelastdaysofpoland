krosniewice.1001.t: "Rutkowski patrol takes over the Consortium"
krosniewice.1001.desc: "Who would've guessed a mercenary company would thrive in a post-apocalyptic reality? Having made a fortune by offering protection and detective services to frightened consumers allowed Rutkowski to amass enough wealth to become the largest shareholder among the companies constituting the Consortium. He's already centralizing his power as the de facto ruler and uses all of the Consortium's assets to ensure safety in towns and roads which not so long ago were infested by numerous bandits. Citizens of the Consortium can sleep peacefully as no case is too insignificant, or too daunting for the fame-hungry detective."
krosniewice.1001.a: "Groovy."


unification.36.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Rutkowski Patrol unifies the Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.36.desc: "For a long time, Łódź remained one of the few regions not engulfed in constant war, with the local cliques instead taking to the bargaining table to investigate the mysterious nuclear explosion in Bałuty. It seems like cooperation turned out for the better for Łodzian power players, as the region has just got united by a union of three factions working in symbiosis with each other. \n\nThe so-called 'Flower Consortium' is a triumvirate of H. Skrzydlewska, the Łódź Emergency Medical Service, and Krzysztof Rutkowski - ex-private detective, now the Consortium's muscle. With Skrzydlewski handling the money and the Emergency Service providing black market arms and info, Rutkowski utilizes his patrol team to keep any dissent in check and to secure further assets for the Triumvirate, whose neighbours start to fear they might soon receive a knock from a certain guy with a pair of shades and a square, Duke Nukem-esque haircut."
unification.36.a: "The Triumvirate stays strapped."

super.36.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.36.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided.

As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."

POLITICS_KRZYSZTOF_RUTKOWSKI_DESC: "To not only survive but also thrive in the cut-throat landscape of the Consortium’s politics takes a certain kind of toughness. As Skrzydlewski’s corporate state grinds a profit out of the withering lands of Łódź, it leaves all those with at least some heart left in them by the wayside. Perhaps no man exemplifies the values of those whose who remain quite like Krzysztof Rutkowski. Cunning, ruthless, and not afraid to bend the rules and put morals aside, the detective will stop at nothing to reach his ambitions. And it appears even the Necrobaron himself, now simply pushed to the wayside, couldn’t halt Rutkowski’s machinations. \n\nRising to prominence in the early days of the Third Republic, Rutkowski’s fame showcased the country’s desperate need for success stories among the constant stream of everyday mediocrity. As the optimism of newfound sovereignty slowly faded, the detective remained as one of the few figures rising above the gray muck, his mythos, built over a series of notable cases, forever enshrined in the nation’s memory. \n\nDespite his star fading, Rutkowski’s repour would prove enough to sustain him throughout the twenties, his times as a detective now merely a source of nostalgia. He was evidently not meant to be granted a quiet retirement, however, as in the midst of the country’s collapse a mystery would emerge unlike any other in his career. With the perpetrator of the Bałuty nuclear strike unknown, it fell upon Rutkowski to solve his grandest case yet. Assembling the patrol together for the first time in years, the detective soon found himself in the employ of Witold Skrzydlewski, forming the Consortium’s security apparatus. \n\nOver the following months, Rutkowski spent his time meticulously accruing influence, eventually strongarming the Necrobaron into giving up control of his enterprise. The detective now leads the statelet with his dedicated corps of mercenaries, ready to play kingmaker among Poland’s numerous warlords. What they fail to realize in their petty squabbles over ideology is that war above all means §Gprofit.§! And Rutkowski is ready to turn their misery and conflict into a true money-making machine."
