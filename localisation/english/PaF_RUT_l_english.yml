RUT_aleksandrow_shuffle: "Aleksandrów Shuffle"
RUT_aleksandrow_shuffle_desc:"Most officers from Precinct 41 do what is called the Aleksandrów Shuffle — cracking open containers. They also like to open doors and see what's behind them. Maybe secrets? Maybe... more juicy containers? Let's be honest, they like *all* containers. Trash cans, utensil trays, manholes, coat pockets, secret containers left behind by the communist secret services that hold forbidden relics. Most of the time, they take all that glitters to fill the in their monthly salary. When accused of appropriation, they often justify themselves by stating that all of the objects found on the crime scene and in the surrounding areas can help crack the case, and everything that was confiscated will be returned after the investigation ends. That is probably why most of them don't do that."
RUT_mercenary_tribunal: "Mercenary Tribunal"
RUT_mercenary_tribunal_desc: "The justice on the territories directly controlled by the Patrol is like the series from Rutkowski's MP5 - not that accurate, but definitely swift and gets the job done. The detectives care little about the presumption of innocence, search warrants, private property, or personal inviolability. If they've got a feeling you're culpable, you'd best leave the area. The most heinous criminals are usually executed, but what about lesser felons? Krzysztof Rutkowski likes catching criminals, but not taking care of their imprisonment. The lesser thieves or hooligans are forced to pay the monetary recompense. What if they can't pay? That's where H. Skrzydlewska company comes in to pick up its new employees." 
RUT_crime_unit: "Major Crime Unit Training"
RUT_crime_unit_desc: "If you do one thing enough times, you'll eventually get the hang of it. That's how Rutkowski dealt with the whole crime-fighting thing. The dissolution of regional districts of state police and the influx of experienced officers to the private defence market definitely helped. Even if Rutkowski omits to mention this fact. Either way, even if the international situation demands that Rutkowski militarize his Patrol, it's first and foremost a peacekeeping force and detective agency dedicated to keeping peace around Aleksandrów and the whole territories of Krośniewice Clique."

krosniewice.1001.t: "Rutkowski patrol takes over the Consortium"
krosniewice.1001.desc: "Who would've guessed a mercenary company would thrive in a post-apocalyptic reality? Having made a fortune by offering protection and detective services to frightened consumers allowed Rutkowski to amass enough wealth to become the largest shareholder among the companies constituting the Consortium. He's already centralizing his power as the de facto ruler and uses all of the Consortium's assets to ensure safety in towns and roads which not so long ago were infested by numerous bandits. Citizens of the Consortium can sleep peacefully as no case is too insignificant, or too daunting for the fame-hungry detective."
krosniewice.1001.a: "Groovy."


unification.36.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Rutkowski Patrol unifies the Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.36.desc: "For a long time, Łódź remained one of the few regions not engulfed in constant war, with the local cliques instead taking to the bargaining table to investigate the mysterious nuclear explosion in Bałuty. It seems like cooperation turned out for the better for Łodzian power players, as the region has just got united by a union of three factions working in symbiosis with each other. \n\nThe so-called 'Flower Consortium' is a triumvirate of H. Skrzydlewska, the Łódź Emergency Medical Service, and Krzysztof Rutkowski - ex-private detective, now the Consortium's muscle. With Skrzydlewski handling the money and the Emergency Service providing black market arms and info, Rutkowski utilizes his patrol team to keep any dissent in check and to secure further assets for the Triumvirate, whose neighbours start to fear they might soon receive a knock from a certain guy with a pair of shades and a square, Duke Nukem-esque haircut."
unification.36.a: "The Triumvirate stays strapped."

unification_alt.36.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Rutkowski Patrol unifies the Łódź Voivodeship"
unification_alt.36.desc: "Heist of a century in Łódzkie. Defying all contracts and deals, Rutkowski stood against his former allies, accusing them of heinous crimes. He broke all ties with them and declared war in the name of justice. His men, having the most combat experience, triumphed over the hired guns of his enemies. Hastening the hand of justice, as he put it, his kangaroo court sentenced Skrzydlewski and Ebrantil to death for murder, human trafficking, and organ trade. He then turned his shade-covered eyes upon the other 'bandits' roaming the Łódzkie, intending to put them on trial. Now the whole voivodeship is under his control. His supporters praise his integrity and dedication to crimefighting, but his opponents point out that his sense of justice overrules any law. Even these laws that his government itself has written. Many also find his showmanship distasteful, accusing him of caring little for the people he helps."
unification_alt.36.a: "Detective Rutkowski is back!"

super.36.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.36.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.36.a: "United at last."

POLITICS_KRZYSZTOF_RUTKOWSKI_DESC: "To not only survive but also thrive in the cut-throat landscape of the Consortium's politics takes a certain kind of toughness. As Skrzydlewski's corporate state grinds a profit out of the withering lands of Łódź, it leaves all those with at least some heart left in them by the wayside. Perhaps no man exemplifies the values of those whose who remain quite like Krzysztof Rutkowski. Cunning, ruthless, and not afraid to bend the rules and put morals aside, the detective will stop at nothing to reach his ambitions. And it appears even the Necrobaron himself, now simply pushed to the wayside, couldn't halt Rutkowski's machinations. \n\nRising to prominence in the early days of the Third Republic, Rutkowski's fame showcased the country's desperate need for success stories among the constant stream of everyday mediocrity. As the optimism of newfound sovereignty slowly faded, the detective remained as one of the few figures rising above the gray muck, his mythos, built over a series of notable cases, forever enshrined in the nation's memory. \n\nDespite his star fading, Rutkowski's repour would prove enough to sustain him throughout the twenties, his times as a detective now merely a source of nostalgia. He was evidently not meant to be granted a quiet retirement, however, as in the midst of the country's collapse a mystery would emerge unlike any other in his career. With the perpetrator of the Bałuty nuclear strike unknown, it fell upon Rutkowski to solve his grandest case yet. Assembling the patrol together for the first time in years, the detective soon found himself in the employ of Witold Skrzydlewski, forming the Consortium's security apparatus. \n\nOver the following months, Rutkowski spent his time meticulously accruing influence, eventually strongarming the Necrobaron into giving up control of his enterprise. The detective now leads the statelet with his dedicated corps of mercenaries, ready to play kingmaker among Poland's numerous warlords. What they fail to realize in their petty squabbles over ideology is that war above all means §Gprofit.§! And Rutkowski is ready to turn their misery and conflict into a true money-making machine."
