unification.106.desc:0 "Today, Polish families gather in front of the few still functioning TVs within the country, attuned to the words of Zygmunt Solorz-Żak - the chairman of both Cyfrowy Polsat S.A. and the de facto statelet the company controls. The corporation’s militias - initially serving only as security forces guarding company assets - managed to carve out a sizeable chunk of territory in the chaos of the Polish anarchy, eventually conquering all of Radom Land. Despite the ever-tightening grip on administration and law, as well as the suppression of independent enterprises, the state’s inhabitants seem to be kept content with bread and (digital) circuses and promises of security, accepting their quotas and contracts binding them to the Group. As more and more Polsat Plus transmitters appear in neighbouring lands, neighbouring warlords begin conducting bans on Polsat-owned media and people of Łódzkie intensify their raids on Polsat's turf, furious at Solorz-Żak for his involvement in the Polish SMR program."

unificationreg.106.desc:0 "Grupa Polsat Plus continues branching out into the fields of administration and military as the corporate state the company's been building on Poland's ruins cements its rule and expands further up the Vistula, having just reached the southernmost parts of the Holy Cross Voivodeship. \nThe Group has provided a steady flow of televised entertainment and internet access to the population living under its rule, making itself more presentable to the newly conquered population that now has to deal with corporate life most of their time, not only at work. \n\nAs neighbouring cliques start completely blocking access to Polsat Plus television and phone connections, international observers start predicting how a Polsat-owned Poland will look like, and how long can a company hold that many people under direct rule, before people finally get fed up with the everpresent yellow ball logo."
unificationreg.106.a:0 "Actually, most of us are fed up with the current logo - bring the old Sun logo back!!!"

unificationsupreg.106.desc:0 "Despite it's military successes, Polsat's and Plus's restructurization from a media empire in a literal one becomes ever more difficult, as as the Group integrates more and more lands and businesses into its corporate web, its state must come up with new ways to legitimize its rule and to convince a population that once again becomes disused to living in chaotic anarchy that its money-driven, rather than ideological rule and promises of safety and rule of law (or rather ruleset) can satiate the Poles' thirst for ideological victory. todo"
