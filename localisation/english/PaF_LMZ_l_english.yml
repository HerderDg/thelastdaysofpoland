unification.103.desc: "Glasses clink in unison, the sound resonating across Podlasie. Today, Marek Jakubiak and his clique celebrate, as the politician’s semi-retirement into brewing, due to the grace of the Fall, ended up providing him with a true path to power. Allying himself with elements of the Van Pur corporation, initially to corner the local market, the instability of the collapse forced the partners to use a portion of their vast combined wealths to form a mercenary-focused army in order to protect their holdings from local warlords. With total war breaking out in the region Jakubiak threw his hat in the ring, relying on the discipline of his hired guns to achieve a string of victories, culminating in the assertion of full control over Podlasie. Despite the leader’s unwillingness to enact any meaningful reform to better their well-being, the people of the region seem content with their new government, a fact perhaps aided by the abundance of a certain mind-lulling substance."
