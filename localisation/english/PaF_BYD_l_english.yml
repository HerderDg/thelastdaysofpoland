unification.83.desc:0 "The silence breaks in the lands of Kuyavia with a single, threatening missive broadcast all across Poland. The message delivered to all the country's warlords rings clear - submit or face forceful assimilation. The senders - the enigmatic 'Humanity Unification Front' - a collective aiming to eventually bring the entire planet under one centralized leadership, has wrestled control over the region following a devastating string of conflicts powered by what official doctrine refers to as the 'indomitable human spirit.' Forsaking individuality for the common good of all Earth's inhabitants, the movement sets its sights on a goal far more ambitious than Kuyavia's subjugation. The current fragmentation cannot stand. The endless cycle of brotherly conflict will end, and global peace will be achieved by the way of the sword. Terra must burn so that the flames may mold it together, bringing forth an age of unity at last."
