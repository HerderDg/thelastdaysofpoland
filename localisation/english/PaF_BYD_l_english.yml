## News Events ##
unification.83.t: "[GetNewspaper]Metropolis of Bydgoszcz unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.83.desc: "Recent news reports from Kuyavia indicate an outcome that aligns with most experts' pre-war predictions. The industrial and populational advantage held by the region's largest city, untouched by the invasion nor the instability that followed, proved far too much for the surrounding warlords to defend against. The victory of Bydgoszcz's liberal-aligned administration likely signifies the reinforcement of the status quo in the voivodeship, save for a few worrying details. The reveal of Bruski's planned collaboration with the EU forces has permanently tarnished the president's reputation, leaving him an enemy of much of the political scene. The unrest that rocked the metropolis, and especially the harsh crackdowns that followed have eroded the population's faith in their institutions. A crack spreads across the pristine democratic façade, deepening with each day that preventive 'anti-insurgent' measures remain in place."
unification.83.a: "In place of cheers, the indifference of disillusion."

unification.207.t: "[GetNewspaper]Sacre Coeur Bidgostie unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.207.desc: "Historically, Bydgoszcz has usually been regarded as Kuyavia's liberal stronghold, yet the news of Bruski's attempted defection to the European Union's invading forces ignited a fury within the city's inhabitants that altered everything it has come to be known for. Though the metropolis has exerted control over the voivodeship, the region has been conquered not by a mild-mannered democracy but by an almost fascistic clerical state led by the controversial preacher Roman Kneblewski. While the priest had previously been pushed to the absolute fringes of the Church for his numerous controversial diatribes, this outspokenness allowed him to topple the city's government with the help of fiercely nationalistic elements. Mandatory mass attendance and frequent raids by the so-called 'Guardians of Morality' are only some of the drastic changes felt by Kuyavia's citizens as the region's liberties slip to contort to a schismatic's archaic vision of a purer faith."
unification.207.a: "Iudica me, Deus..."

unification.208.t: "[GetNewspaper]Metropolis of Bydgoszcz unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.208.desc: "In every corner of Kuyavia, in the furthest reaches of war-torn Poland, through firsthand knowledge or distorted overheard stories, confused voices clamor: PiS is back! The chairman is back! Yet something is not right, for the man clinging to Kaczyński's legacy is merely a cheap impersonation of the long-missing politician. The familiar rhetoric that pushed the country forward for the past decade is still there, almost unchanged in its blunt directness, but the message behind it feels different; as if a mockery of the values it has come to represent. While the party's traditional base regards "The Chairman" with warm nostalgia for the better days under the PiS government, most pundits recommend careful skepticism towards the new state's intentions. With subtle liberal undertones carefully interwoven into the supposedly conservative messaging, the character might end up being far more than just a simple imitation."
unification.208.a: "The legacy of PiS burns from the inside."

super.83.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.83.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.83.a: "United at last."

##IDEAS##
 
BYD_zdrada: "Unrealized Fifth Column"
BYD_zdrada_desc: "Gdańsk, Poznań, Wrocław... every major city in Western Poland revealed its traitorous intentions by contributing to the Invasion... every single one except Bydgoszcz. Sticking by the national government to the very end earned Bruski the respect of nearly the entire political spectrum. What they don't know is that we fully intended to join the other side; it's just that the Germans stalled before the plans materialized. All documents relating to the anticipated takeover have been either burned or buried. There is no paper trail, at least not one that we know of. Oh, please let there be no paper trail. §RIf this ever gets out, our government won't survive the ensuing storm.§!"

BYD_oaza: "A Peaceful Oasis"
BYD_oaza_desc: "Kuyavia has fallen into war and instability. At any given point, some sort of conflict rages in the region, a warlord oppresses his own people, or an uprising defies the entrenched balance of power. There is only one city untouched by the unrest; one destination firmly etched in the head of everyone in the voivodeship who's been forced to flee from their homes - Bydgoszcz. It's a surprisingly comfortable position. Even if we're far from perfect, all we need to do is remind the people of a simple fact - life only gets worse outside of our borders."

BYD_system: "You Can't Beat the System"
BYD_system_desc: "Local government has the unfortunate tendency to become entrenched with all kinds of unwritten pacts and connections. The same barons occupy their seats in city councils for decades, blocking any meaningful change from rocking the boat and excluding all newcomers. The democratic process crashes against the wall of anocratic officials, attempting to chip away at its stagnant foundation, but ultimately, everything always returns to a state of stasis. Eventually, the once-optimistic citizens might come to a natural conclusion - why even bother trying?"
