 POLITICS_BARTLOMIEJ_SIENKIEWICZ_DESC: "Up to this date Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz holds credit for the most accurate description of the condition of Polish state: §t„it exists only in theory… Cock, ass and a shitton of rocks”§!. These words, though not initially about Poland as a whole, are also an example of self-fulfilling prophecy, as the Poles believed them long enough that, one day, boom – they were 100%, literally, applicable to a letter. \n\nSienkiewicz, however, would not like them to be true. He was never the one to content himself with doing little. As one of the most active and prominent members of the Civic Platform and Tusk’s strong-arm, he hated Law and Justice with passion – which made him a prime target for the remnants of the ancien regime. After unsuccessful attempt to organize resistance in his hometown of Kielce, he was forced to flee east to Sandomierz, forming one of the last redoubts against encroaching Ziobro’s forces. \n\nThis is not a simple headhunt. Sienkiewicz is a symbol of what Law and Justice considers to be the source of evil. An educated, slick, anticlerical liberal, his image was cemented the moment he was spied on in a high-end restaurant in Warsaw, formulating his aforementioned definition. The whole PiS could thank Sienkiewicz, for if they could not use his figure as an allegory of Civic Platform arrogance, they would not seize power. Now, the show nears its grand finale, and Sienkiewicz has to fall. \n\nBut Sienkiewicz won’t fall. He was an actual, experienced Minister of Interior, unlike PiS lackeys, and unlike them, he did not put life into his prophecy with his own hands. Sandomierz will remain a free, European city, a beacon to cling to in face of despotism. No matter the cost."
 POLITICS_OJCIEC_MATEUSZ_DESC: "In the late twenties, much like the whole country, the historic city of Sandomierz has gone through proverbial hell, emerging from one catastrophe only to end up facing another. Though the town was largely spared from the Fall's immediate devastation, the nation's collapse nonetheless shattered the blissful status quo previously enjoyed by the residents. In a time filled with constant uncertainty, where any new day could bring either conflict, unrest, or famine, Father Mateusz represents that which the city most needed - a calm guiding hand to reassure the weary populace. For the poor souls unable to cope with the damage brought upon by the Fall and its subsequent consequences, the priest stands as a final beacon of hope to rally behind, however unproven and idealistic he may be. \n\nDespite his rapid ascent, the man bearing the beloved persona never intended to be the city's hero. At no point did he claim to be an authentic representation of the character he played, nor strive for any spotlight beyond that which his contract stipulated. But as the internal situation in Sandomierz deteriorated and trust towards the city's leadership reached an unprecedented low, the initially playful, in-character greetings quickly gave way to concerned citizens desperately turning for advice to the sole remaining authority they still trusted; the only one who showed genuine concern for their wellbeings. In many ways, Father Mateusz represents the city's collective delusion, a desire to cling to normalcy even as the world around it crumbles - a piece of fiction supposedly brought to life, a priest without ordainment, a masterful detective lacking any formal training - the contradictions matter little to those with nothing else to believe in. \n\nElevated as the city's savior on a wave of ubiquitous public support and met with thousands of expectant hearts, hoping he'll solve all of its numerous problems, Father Mateusz was cast into a position he always hoped he'd avoid. Yet, though he may otherwise steer way clear of any political power and the excesses to which it inevitably leads, the 'priest' has no choice but to wield it in full - for them, and for the millions left struggling in the remains what once used to be Poland - forgotten, alone, and afraid. To show everyone that the humanitarian spirit can survive even in the darkest of times and that though all may seem to be lost, the combined, selfless efforts of a caring community can always bring about a better tomorrow."

 SND_cityonahill_desc: "Sandomierz, an unscarred beacon within a beacon of peace! Tucked away in a corner where no war or violence can truly reach it, Sandomierz stands above most other cities, as even when war broke out in the Holy Cross Voivodeship the city stood far away from it. With prior help of the now defunct Ukrainian Humanitarian Mission a stable and powerful city grows."

SND_dusk_in_royal_city_desc: "Ahh, Sandomierz... the one place that the Fall failed to reach. Where the quiet cobbled streets still lead life at the same pace as they did for the past centuries. The royal city - an oasis of peace and home for all those fleeing persecution. The brightest light shining across a region that has otherwise descended into darkness. Even if Poland continues to fragment, and each of these fragments devotes itself to fighting the others, the Republic of Sandomierz will continue to stand above them all, free of the devastation they bring upon the country. And in time, the city will return to its full, historic glow, and nothing shall disturb its peace, unless..."
  
SND_so_long_peace: "So Long, Peace..."
SND_so_long_peace_desc: "...unless Ziobro comes in to finish the job. Of course. And it just had to be on Christmas of all days. As if he ever had any shame. For 'harboring the known criminal Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz, sentenced to lifetime imprisonment by the lawful government of the Third Republic,' he declared our Republic a rogue state and sent his men to end its sovereignty. What a pathetic excuse. Through what backward logic does this reason justify the simultaneous invasion of Starachowice? The truth is - the Prosecutor is out for blood, and he won't stop until the whole voivodeship kneels before him. But rather than become yet another obedient satrapy, we will fight to defend our freedom. The odds may be overwhelmingly against us, but if we can at least slightly rough him up before it's over, that should count as a moral victory."
  
SND_turn_media_attention: "Turn Media Attention to the War"
SND_turn_media_attention_desc: "There's a time for media pluralism, but with a hostile army rapidly encroaching on our territory, every other outlet blasting critiques of the administration is the last thing we need. So, let's get our stories straight: if you enjoy having liberties - the Prosecutorship is going to take them all away. If you wear a red heart, a green clover, or anything that isn't that damn blue eagle on your chest, you WILL face persecution if we lose this war. And if you just as much as looked at him wrong or wrote some disparaging decade-old comment you've since long forgotten about - §RZIOBRO. IS. COMING. TO. GET. YOU.§! On every channel, down to the most irrelevant regional station, this message better be the main story."
  
SND_in_for_the_long_haul: "In for the Long Haul"
SND_in_for_the_long_haul_desc: "Months of deadlock, one step back after another... and we're still acting like it's business as usual. Unless we want to burn ourselves out and realize one day that what little remains of our stockpiles has run dry, it's time to start taking some drastic measures. The fields we still control up north are not even close to covering existing demand. It's either rations now or famine in a month. For now, we can start off simple - some minor restrictions on the number of purchasable goods allowed per person should be enough to prevent the worst shortages. And if the people don't like it - well, it's still far better than the alternative."

SND_demonize_their_forces: "Demonize Their Forces"
SND_demonize_their_forces_desc: "The early months of the war have shown that most soldiers aren't particularly eager to kill their fellow countrymen, even if they're Ziobrites. Squeezing any effectiveness out of our troops will require the right incentives... and a good mental picture. We need to drill the image into everyone's minds - the men beyond our frontlines aren't their brothers. They're ruthless, single-minded killers who, if they hadn’t been co-opted into Ziobro’s ranks, would likely be pillaging and burning villages for fun instead. So unless they want these dogs to do as they please, every able-bodied person better give their all for the Republic, for their families, and for everyone else in the city who can't defend themselves."

SND_call_more_volunteers: "Call on More Volunteers"
SND_call_more_volunteers_desc: "People across Sandomierz weep, as the war effort has begun to stall out with a lack of manpower. This is no good! For if the cogs slow down, and momentum stops and possibly switches we may all crumble in this conflict. So it’s time for the media to crank out propaganda on the scale of the various Media-Conglomerates! With the help of studying the various propaganda that the US media puts out, we may find a way to put out similarly ABSURD propaganda."

SND_against_battered_giant: "Against the Battered Giant"
SND_against_battered_giant_desc: "The audacity Ziobro has, his people have suffered in this war and he continues it, even with his army and his populace's war exhaustion, he really has turned into a brute, a fake Caesar. With Ziobro’s declaration to keep the war going, even with the losses he has suffered, a renewed sense of patriotism spikes all throughout Sandomierz. While this happens in Sandomierz, the opposite happens in the Prosecutorship, Ziobro’s forces begin to feel the effects of the prolonged war, exhaustion truly sets in with his forces practically sleep depraved, morale crumbles as the war gets more and more unfavorable, now is the time to batter the giant further."

SND_rudimentary_ambush_tactics: "Rudimentary Ambush Tactics"
SND_rudimentary_ambush_tactics_desc: "Ziobro and his offensive are beginning to weather on our defense of Iron! This may be time to enact truly interesting battle tactics, like a lesser Vietcong. Minor traps, Hit and Run and general destabilizing tactics can now be adapted into our main battle plan and main tactics. Against Ziobro’s poorly trained militias, and with a little bit of training whether it be trial by fire or out-of-battle training, these tactics may truly puncture Ziobro!"

SND_build_temporary_fortifications: "Build up Temporary Fortifications"
SND_build_temporary_fortifications_desc: "With the advent of Ziobro and his forces' fierce attacks, Sandomierz and its high command have all agreed it’d be a good idea to build up temporary, but good nonetheless fortifications. Minor trench networks, woodland camps, punji sticks and many more. The people of Sandomierz have even turned out in support for this military act, with many various small or minor volunteer corps forming to help accelerate the construction of the temporary fortifications."

SND_start_renewed_offensive: "Start a Renewed Offensive"
SND_start_renewed_offensive_desc: "The order shall be given! With Ziobro’s crumble and the Prosecutorships forces waning completely, the time to truly push has come. All field commanders have been given the strict order to attack, with a force beyond that of our enemies understanding and a ferocity to claw a bear to the ground. With this order one constant is seen, the probability of territorial growth, the giant may crumble under our pressure and lose land while we gain many territorial concessions from them. But before that we must leave them a shell, an empty shell with nothing but bloodied soil inside of it."

SND_our_future_secured: "Our Future Secured?"
SND_our_future_secured_desc: "Huh, it's... actually over. It's almost hard to believe, but despite the overwhelming assault of Ziobro's forces, somehow, we are still standing. So... that means the hard part should be behind us now, right? It's not like we've thrown everything we have at the enemy, angered our own people in the process, let the domestic situation deteriorate far beyond our control, absolutely ruined the city's economy, left absolutely no opportunities for the returning veterans, canceled all... is there even a point to keep listing everything that is currently wrong with Sandomierz? We have our work cut out for us. Now's no time for celebrations."

###   Sandomierz Post-War Tree   ###

SND_war_fallout: "The War's Fallout"
SND_war_fallout_desc: "Alright, new beginnings. It's time to roll up our sleeves and tackle the unending multitude of problems and instability otherwise referred to as post-war Sandomierz. Somehow, the fact that we've just defeated a Ziobrist invasion seems to barely matter in the eyes of a surprisingly large minority, blaming us for allowing the situation to deteriorate this far in the first place. Whatever. Their anger will blow over once we start bringing in concrete results. We just have to... umm... we can start with... Fine; restoring this city to its former glory... or even a somewhat passable state may prove to be slightly more difficult than we would've hoped."

SND_confused_approaches: "Confused Approaches"
SND_confused_approaches_desc: "In response to the population's calls for immediate action, we have proudly met all of their demands and delivered decisive moves - established the Exploratory Committee to Tackle the Social Woes and War Damage within the City of Sandomierz and the Surrounding Counties. In only a short few months, we should be able to present the first preliminary findings, and then, it'll only be a while before we recruit the right people to start getting things done. Only a sensible approach could hope to mitigate the...  why is nobody clapping? Seriously, what's with all the booing and jeering? We're trying to help you out, people! This stuff takes time!"

SND_dealing_with_economy: "Dealing with the Economy"
SND_dealing_with_economy_desc: "So yeah... let's tackle the economy. Well, technically, there isn't really any economy to handle, so at least we have a somewhat blank slate. The negative? The fact that WE BARELY HAVE ANY ECONOMY TO SPEAK OF. Sure, we have a couple of mid-sized factories, a bunch of minor private enterprises, and even some badly damaged infrastructure, but that really shouldn't be the source of any pride. Unless we are fine with forever remaining a provincial backwater carried only on the shoulders of its history, we need to actually start carrying out some meaningful investments."

SND_pilkington_glassworks: "Expansion of the Pilkington Glassworks"
SND_pilkington_glassworks_desc: "The Pilkington Industrial Complex has always been a trustworthy ally, providing our regime with financial backing that proved indispensable in holding back against Ziobro. It would only be appropriate to return the favor, especially since the success of our corporate allies plays into our own. After all, is there anyone who would object to us providing new job opportunities for the unemployed or establishing a foundation for our future exports? The expansion of Pilkington is far more than just a handout. It's a sign the Republic is about to become a meaningful regional player."

SND_sandomierz_opatow_railway: "Sandomierz-Opatów Railway"
SND_sandomierz_opatow_railway_desc: "The patchwork of railway lines left behind by the Third Republic is an unfortunate mismatch with the geography of our nation, to say the least. The current link from Sandomierz is immediately cut off by the borders of Subcarpathia on both sides, effectively locking us out from utilizing rail freight in any reasonable capacity. But what luck won't give us, we'll accomplish ourselves anyway. The line from the capital to our forward outpost in Opatów will be the start of a network that's eventually going to link all noteworthy towns to the central nexus in Sandomierz... in the somewhat distant future."

SND_tradeport_on_vistula: "Building a Tradeport on the Vistula"
SND_tradeport_on_vistula_desc: "The Fall did wonders in revitalizing trade across Poland's waterways. Generally, attacking an armored boat in the middle of a river that provides clear visibility is a slightly tougher ordeal than setting up an ambush in any random forested or hilly stretch of a poorly maintained road. Our partners are looking for safety, so if we want to keep them on board and expand our reach beyond the borders of the first hostile warlord that stands in the way of our traders, it'd be a good option to turn some of the undeveloped moorlands into a port capable of sending out vessels across the entire length of the Vistula."

SND_repairing_north_roads: "Repairing the Roads North"
SND_repairing_north_roads_desc: "It's hard to project any degree of control over our territories when the second you exit the capital's administrative borders, the roads immediately start becoming an unmaintained, pothole-infested nightmare.  How can we expect to maintain regular supply chains between Sandomierz and our regional bastions up north when anything larger than a family van has trouble making it across? It's time to start thinking beyond the scope of our city. Besides, a couple of maintenance crews should be enough to do the job. It's not that long of a distance, anyway. How much could there realistically be to fix?"

SND_new_powerlines: "New Powerlines to the Countryside"
SND_new_powerlines_desc: "It's pitiful and, honestly, incredibly telling proof of the miserable state of the country that most of the countryside still doesn't have power because... the people stole all the wiring while the Fall was still taking place. We could technically raid the junkyards they traded their loot to for quick cash, but unlike what some of our citizens claim, we're actually a benevolent government that doesn't mind spending a portion of its operating budget to reconnect our villages to the modern world. Just uhh... once we're done installing the missing cables, let's post some guards to make sure they don't end up getting pilfered again."

SND_dwikozy_cannery: "Expansion of the Dwikozy Cannery"
SND_dwikozy_cannery_desc: "The agricultural cooperative in Dwikozy remains one of the few bright spots we can rely on in terms of domestic production. But while its output effortlessly dwarfs that of most other enterprises, we have been granted the perfect opportunity to turn it into a nationwide giant. Think about it - when is the demand for canned goods at its highest? In times of crisis, when everyone is frantically stocking up on non-perishables. And oh, we sure are in one massive crisis. If we expand our production, we could easily have our products stacked in bunkers from Gdańsk to Zakopane and beyond."

SND_dealing_with_crime: "Dealing with the Crime"
SND_dealing_with_crime_desc: "You can never fully prevent crime - not around these parts, and definitely not in our current situation. Some poor souls will always wander into the wrong neighborhood, and certain items are bound to go missing. That's just the way of life. What we can't tolerate, however, is when one of our ministers has his house broken into in the middle of the day, and the police prove unable to do ANYTHING about it. That's it. We've had enough. This open lawlessness is coming to an end. We will not tolerate anarchy on the streets of our beautiful city!"

SND_extraordinary_commission: "Extraordinary Commission for the Matters of Crime"
SND_extraordinary_commission_desc: "If one commission isn't enough to tackle the recent increase in criminality,  we must take an unprecedented move and establish YET. ANOTHER. COMMISSION. That's right. The full might of two dozen seasoned legislative experts is about to bear down on anyone foolish enough to challenge the rule of law. Already, our informants within certain prominent criminal organizations report that the bosses tremble in the face of our rational, measured approach to the issue. All we need to do is find an appropriate consensus solution that will satisfy the concerns of everyone involved, and we're good to go. And that should happen soon... ish."

SND_police_funding_bill: "Police Funding Bill"
SND_police_funding_bill_desc: "While our current budget looks bleak at best, some actions are necessary enough for us to gladly go temporarily into the red. The local police have the operating budget of a village housewives' association, successfully turning just about everyone away from joining the force while those that still serve are forced to survive on a regular series of handouts and bribes. If we want our servicemen to finally start doing their jobs and crush the neverending crime wave, we have to drastically increase their funding, up to the point of overkill if necessary. Consequences be damned."

SND_cameras_at_every_corner: "Cameras at Every Street Corner"
SND_cameras_at_every_corner_desc: "Our main issue with persecuting the criminals still happily terrorizing Sandomierz is the fact we can't prove pretty much anything. Most of the time, we're left relying on the sole testimony of some 70-year-old half-blind pensioner who, in the dark of night, couldn't distinguish between a suspect and a sufficiently large trash bag. If the eyes on the ground can't be trusted, we'll have to install our own. With cameras monitoring all streets and staring into the forgotten depths of every dark alley, there won't be a single thing in this city that is allowed to go unseen."

SND_reopen_castle_prison: "Reopen the Castle Prison"
SND_reopen_castle_prison_desc: "The people demand crackdowns? Oh, we'll give them crackdowns. In fact, we're going to be so effective; we'll need some additional space to keep all the criminals, troublemakers, vagabonds, and the like behind bars. Luckily for us, there's a slightly crude solution that could increase our prison capacity by almost 50% without incurring any extra costs. Over the centuries, the castle cellar has often been used as a makeshift dun... jail. The comparisons to past regimes that utilized this solution are bound to be unflattering, but if we shuffle the museum pieces clogging up the former cells elsewhere, we could easily fill the place up with just about anyone we need to keep out of public view."

SND_dealing_with_priest: "Dealing with the Priest"
SND_dealing_with_priest_desc: "Of course, there's always one. Always some ungrateful troublemaker who thinks he could do a better job than experienced government officials. In the current state of the Republic, we can't afford the people turning to some other imagined parallel authority, much less one as absurd as a fake wannabe pretending to be a fictional priest. Seriously, are we the only ones seeing through this nonsense? He may seem harmless now, but with the attention he's been attracting, this 'Father Mateusz' could soon become a threat. We have no choice but to expose him for who he really is - nothing but a fraud."

SND_push_against_church: "Subtly Push Back Against the Church"
SND_push_against_church_desc: "Everyone's afraid to face it, but the Catholic Church is quite likely the worst parasite infesting the Polish lands. The excesses of its leaders show that the Kler serve nothing but their own vain self-interest, all while hurling moral judgment and stirring dissent against every reasonable secular government. We can't take them on outright, not yet at least, but we can plant the first seeds of doubt in the people's minds. We were able to acquire sensitive information regarding some of the Church's more... suspect dealings. It would be such a shame if that knowledge were to be suddenly leaked to every single media outlet in Sandomierz."

SND_plant_provocateurs: "Plant Provocateurs at Meetings"
SND_plant_provocateurs_desc: "If the priest won't say or do anything controversial on his own, we'll make him do it instead. A group of our loyal agitators will follow his every step, waiting for any opening, any opportunity to strike, and then, when he least expects it, they'll challenge him in front of the crowds. We'll see how well this supposed 'humanitarian nature' of his holds when dealing with our provocateurs. We just know he'll crack and say something that we can latch on to - something that will forever ruin the fake image he's building around himself. All we need to do is wait."

SND_stanislaw_of_szczepanowo: "Stanisław of Szczepanowo"
SND_stanislaw_of_szczepanowo_desc: "We've been left with no other choice. 'Father Mateusz' is a dangerous lunatic, and for the sake of the Republic, we won't let him question our rule any longer. With a favorable enough interpretation, we could technically label his actions as calling for the overthrow of our government, giving us just cause to temporarily arrest him until tempers calm down and we've solidified our position. The people will surely get angry, and we are bound to face severe backlash, but detaining the so-called priest is the only appropriate course of action. In time, they will thank us for it."

SND_management_of_new_lands: "Dealing with the New Lands"
SND_management_of_new_lands_desc: "Despite all analyses indicating we'd have been lucky to survive the war with Ziobro in any reduced state, we've somehow come out of it holding even more territory than before. While many are still preoccupied with celebrations as if this is the end of all our problems, they keep forgetting that we have to actually... run the place. We've already wasted far too much time triumphally parading around the area without accomplishing a single thing of note. At this point, it's almost becoming comical. We're calling everyone back. No more victory laps until we figure out a realistic plan on how we're to govern our spoils."

SND_expand_our_administration: "Expand Our Administration"
SND_expand_our_administration_desc: "The one thing we can't complain about the lack of is the overwhelming number of seasoned administrators - most still out of a job. There's just something about Ziobro's rampant political persecution and the forcible removal of anyone unwilling to comply with his militant, unlawful agenda that makes local officials flee to the one place in the voivodeship that actually functions like a real democracy. And now, after months of discouraging idleness, they're desperate to get back out there and return to their cushy positions in the local bureaucracy. Fortunately, we have the perfect news for the most able and ideologically suitable among them."

SND_new_defence_lines: "New Defense Lines"
SND_new_defence_lines_desc: "We may have won this round, but let's not get lured into complacency - Ziobro will be back, and this time, he's going to throw everything he has against us. The blow we've dealt the Prosecutorship is far from fatal, and it's only going to embolden them even further. The gloves are off, so unless we want to find out just how far their vengefulness goes, we better be prepared to not give them even an inch of our territory. A rudimentary line of border forts is far from a guarantee of safety, but it's better than nothing once the armageddon starts."

SND_towards_new_tomorrow: "Towards a New Tomorrow"
SND_towards_new_tomorrow_desc: "The past few months have been tough, perhaps even more so than the war, but what matters is - we're still holding on. From a seemingly unwinnable war to a supposedly unsolvable crisis, we have shown resilience far beyond what nearly everyone expected. And though we're still widely despised and the challenges before us remain just as daunting as before, we can start working on implementing a long-term plan instead of just reacting to whatever new issue pops up this time. Maybe eventually, this place won't be such an unbearable and ungrateful backwater after all."

###   Mateusz First Tree   ###

SND_rebirth_of_faith: "The Rebirth of Faith"
SND_rebirth_of_faith_desc: "Choosing neither of the two partisan evils that plagued Poland before the Fall, the people of Sandomierz overcame them with good. With the shackles of the old system cast away, they declared popular half-legitimate preacher, Father Mateusz Żmigrodzki - the living embodiment of a beloved fictional hero - to be their shepherd. A highly controversial figure, he is seen by many as the last good priest in Poland, a blasphemer by some, and a misguided idealist by others. Nevertheless, he's certainly the only possible ruler in the Sandomierzan power vacuum, so even his most staunch opponents refrain from drastic actions against him until they find a suitable pretender. That time may give 'Mateusz' time to consolidate his power. We shall see how a man with little experience with being a priest and even less experience with being a politician will fare at his new task."

SND_turn_toward_industrial_sector: "Turn Towards the Industrial Sector"
SND_turn_toward_industrial_sector_desc: "Ever since the Sandomierz's secession and termination of trade routes leading to Kielce and beyond, our manufacturers and producers have been facing hardships that haven't been properly addressed. Oh, sure Sienkiewicz government made some half-baked attempts to help our industrial sector by introducing some symbolic tax cuts and financial relief programs. Those methods however were too minuscule to make any substantial difference. Now it's time for true help, social spending coupled with government contracts will help to light the spark to our production. Especially, the pride of Sandomierz, Pilkington glassworks. Hmm... perhaps a purchase of new stained windows is in order?"

SND_historical_market: "Revitalise the Historical Market"
SND_historical_market_desc: "Once a center of Sandomierz's trade, then a historical landmark, harboring cafes and small souvenir shops aimed at enchanting tourists with its beauty. With the breakdown in trade and lack of funds for renovation, it fails both tasks. With enough care put into it, we can renovate the gothic tenements and the town hall. Thanks to that, when we open the town market to the extended trade similar to that of medieval times. Encouraged by the ancient beauty of the heart of Sandomierz, traders will flock to our town to engage in fair transactions under the watchful eye of the Immaculate Mother of God. Soon goods transported from the east through National Road 77 and from the south through boats on Vistula will enrich our citizens."

SND_feed_the_hungry: "Feed the Hungry"
SND_feed_the_hungry_desc: "John answered, “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.\nLuke 3:11\n\nBut what can one do, when there's hardly one shirt and next to no food? While the loess and fluvisol soils surrounding Sandomierz are excellent for agriculture, we still aren't able to produce enough to feed everyone. Even then the fruits of farmers' labor are not diversified enough to enable those who can satiate their hunger to receive all necessary nutrients. This issue could be helped by the foreign caravans. That however takes time and a qualified businessman and businesswoman specialized in food retail. They, however, need the capital to do so and many of them went down during those turbulent times. Introducing government loans with low lending rates could help them stand on their own and provide much-needed services to the citizens."

SND_soup_kitchens: "Soup Kitchens"
SND_soup_kitchens_desc: "Food in Sandomierz is now more available. People are sated, but that is still not enough for Father Mateusz, who can't sit idly when hunger, though curtailed, is still rampant among the population. True welfare will come once, the trade finally reestablishes itself on the territories under the guidance of Apostles of Christ. Maybe then after the surplus of food increases the horrendous prices will drop as the Żmigrodzki's sermons resulted only in the minute change on the market. Until a more prosperous future comes, the government should take matters into its own hands and start numerous soup kitchens offering cheap fare to those who need it the most. If need be, Father Mateusz himself will serve the poor to lead by example."

SND_temporary_shelters: "Temporary Shelters"
SND_temporary_shelters_desc: "Refugees and homeless roam the streets of Sandomierz. Some are native to the city and surrounding countryside. Some come from far away, attracted by the legend of a beloved priest from Sandomierz, who came to life to help the poor. No matter where they come from, they all flee from the same - destruction brought by war, destroyed cities, and burned villages. They are already here and sending them away would be heartless. And dangerous if they disapproved of such action. Thus it is our duty to provide them with even the most humble abodes. Right now quantity is more important than quality and though most shelters will take the form of tents and huts found only in the worst of slums. This however is just a temporary measure. In time, some wanderers will leave our nation and then we'll undertake a genuine social housing programme."

SND_stench_of_heavy_industry: "The Stench of Heavy Industry"
SND_stench_of_heavy_industry_desc: "As much as Father Matthew would want to bend the skies for the needful. Alas, Sandomierz is surrounded by numerous enemies ready to vanquish all of the achievements the Apostles have made and persecute the population of Sandomierz. We are far from the times of Messianic Peace. As such we will need to forge swords. And a lot of water will flow under Sandomierz bridge before we'd beat them into plowshares. Unfortunately, there are few forges in our nation. Truth be told, there's hardly any heavy industry in Sandomierz, despite the small glasswork. We need to change that. The faithful may have expected the continuation of welfare programs and not an industrial source of noise and pollution. Nevertheless, the Shepherd must take necessary actions to protect his herd. Popular or otherwise."

SND_trade_with_starachowice: "Renewed Trade with Starachowice"
SND_trade_with_starachowice_desc: "In those trying times, it is good to know we are not completely alone in our struggle against tyranny. Brave people of Starachowice also raised against the General Persecutor. In times when many traded reason for madness they remained as a bastion of moderation and common sense. They also happen to be our close neighbors and thanks to relative safety on the roads both our citizens are able to travel with reasonable ease from one nation to the other. Now that we have begun bringing life to our fledling industrial sector, it is only natural for us to engage in mutual trade. We can offer them toughened glass much needed in the automotive industry as well as stationery and feed for the animals. In turn, we would be most interested in their famous STAR truck for both civilian and military purposes."

SND_getting_our_hands_dirty: "Getting Our Hands Dirty"
SND_getting_our_hands_dirty_desc: "Pre-Fall Sandomierz was never as violent as portrayed in the Father Matthew television series. The show’s dramatic and often far-fetched criminal plots once seemed like an exaggerated fiction. Ironically, compared to the current state of the city's streets, those plots now appear almost idyllic. Today, Sandomierz is plagued by daily occurrences of murder, armed robbery, and a flourishing drug trade. It would be wiser to let professional policemen handle the situation, however, the acute mind and the ability to solve crimes are the most recognizable traits of the character of Mateusz Żmigrodzki.  His sharp mind and unshakable moral compass must serve as a symbol of hope for the people. That is precisely why his hands-on involvement in Sandomierz’s most notorious cases is non-negotiable.  It’s time for Mateusz to roll up his sleeves, mount a humble bicycle, and restore peace to the streets of the city."

SND_picking_where_they_left: "Picking up Where They Left off"
SND_picking_where_they_left_desc: "The list of Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz's sins is immense. The treacherousness, the underhandedness, the corruption, the mismanagement of Sandomierz, tarnishing of the good name of Henryk Sienkiewicz's family are but a few of his faults. But even the greatest sinner is capable of good. And if anything good can be said about Sienkiewicz it's his commitment to fight crime and keep an extensive act archives. While he destroyed many files that directly involved his activities and crimes were destroyed during his escape, practically all of the papers regarding the criminal underworld in Sandomierz are untouched. The suspects, the evidence, and the descriptions of cases that were untimely ended are at our disposal. It would be a shame not to use them, as they would significantly fasten the progress of catching criminals. They may even help us uncover gangs and cases we've not yet discovered."

SND_friends_in_blue: "Friends in Blue Places"
SND_friends_in_blue_desc: "The truth in both television and reality is that Father Mateusz cannot work as a vigilante, disregarding the experienced police and military officers. The lack of coordination or signs of mutiny would be catastrophic for our nation. On the other hand, Father Mateusz needs his iconic crew to be seen in high positions in his government, naturally replacing said experienced officers by taking their seats. Thankfully, both the current minister of war, Colonel Grzegorz Kobylarz, and the head of Sandomierz's police force, Deputy Inspector Grzegorz Jaworski can be generally considered enthusiasts of Mateusz's rule. Let us hope, they'll understand and accept the decision of appointing Orest Możejko, another character from the TV show as their new superior despite his apparent lack of experience. Żmigrodzki will have to use all of his experience to convince them with all of the benevolence and wit of the fictional archetype."

SND_bicycles_for_police: "Bicycles for the Police Force"
SND_bicycles_for_police_desc: "This is not a joke. Despite the whispers of our enemies, bicycles are as viable and legitimate forms of military transport as jeeps and trucks. It's true! Military bicycles emerged at the turn of the 19th century. They have been used by dedicated military units, the Italian, German, and Japanese armies. Military bicycles provide a method of transportation, communication, and reconnaissance. And those operations can be carried out more silently when compared to the performance of power-driven vehicles. They're also cheaper than cars and their usage is more humane than the assistance of horses. Not to mention that a trusty bike is an iconic method of transportation for Father Matthew. While ideally, we'd use special bikes designed for warfare, with a more capacious carrier, we'll have to make do with regular civilian bikes sold and donated by our citizens."

SND_rehabilitation_campaigns: "Rehabilitation Campaigns"
SND_rehabilitation_campaigns_desc: "Although the harsh post-Fall reality can serve as a pretext for the callous handling of the prisoners we've managed to catch. This will not do. Despite all they've done, the prisoners are still people. People who have been pushed to the extreme by the extreme circumstances caused by the collapse of the Polish state. They've come to believe that you can only get by ruthlessness. Who else will show them the right path but us? In our incarceration policy, we'll put the strongest possible emphasis on rehabilitation. While searching for professional psychologists, social workers, and priests will require much effort and generate additional costs in the short term. In due time, however, this method will be cheaper than indefinite incarceration, especially when the inmates become moral and productive members of society."

SND_as_long_as_it_takes: "As Long as it Takes"
SND_as_long_as_it_takes_desc: "The priority of the police and prison service is primarily to ensure the safety of the population. As cruel as it may seem, separating the wheat from the chaff is our top priority, even if it means some will get harsher sentences. With our humble resources, few judges, and mental health specialists, our police chief estimates that practically all of the criminals will end up with life sentences. Crude and barbaric. But we can't hope for more when we have other priorities and enemies at our gates. Regrettable turn of events. In his heart, Żmijewski swears that when the storm upon Vistula calms, inmates will be able to send the appeal and those deserving will receive shorter sentences. That is why we need to make haste to bring law and morality to Poland, so the Apostles' mission will be able to take its intended shape."

SND_big_steps: "Big Steps Towards a Nobler Goal"
SND_big_steps_desc: "It seems we have dealt with the most infamous of the cases that have been plaguing Sandomierz in the last few years. And still, there are a ton of files that gather dust in the archives. Even so, the streets of Sandomierz are already visibly safer, even though the Father's work is not done yet. Make no mistake: Mateusz won't rest on laurels and eventually will take care of them, even though not all of them will attract the media's attention, as the ones the Apostles have already dealt with. All in due time. As of now, we'll have to focus on the criminals that dwell beyond our borders."

sandomierz.1.desc: "At around 9:30 AM Sandomierz troops, moving westward, have entered a tiny town, barely stretching outside the market square, just like many others in the region. Aside a roadblock about a kilometer earlier and a couple of marauding soldiers in a village off the main road, there was no resistance. The men didn’t even try to fight, claiming that an armistice was already in effect and Ziobro’s forces were all falling back. \n\nNevertheless, Sandomirians were told to exercise usual caution when rolling onto the square. As makeshift armoured truck switched its engine off, there was nothing but silence, a bit too eerie even for such a languishing place. The town was dead. Soldiers disembarked and knocked on a couple doors, trying to find any signs of a life form with at least middling intelligence. After a while, one of the doors opened, revealing a worn-out man. \n – Have you seen Ziobro’s forces? – asked the Sandomirian sergeant. \n – Yeah, I’ve seen them. \n – Where are they now? \n – Upstairs – the man beckoned slightly towards the first floor. \n – How... how many of them? \n – Three platoons. \n\n – The windows in the house, as well as a few neighboring ones, opened, and out of each a couple of barrels, granades or makeshift throwing weapons emerged. \n – Commisar Zardecki, General Prosecutorship, nice to meet you. \n – Wwwasn’t there supposed to be armistice already? – said the Sandomirian, taking a few cautious steps back from the doors to figure out the size of shit he found himself in. \n – You know, I actually have no idea.

Hi, could you tell me if the armistice already in effect? I see... Complete chaos? So I guess that’s it? Alright.. Okay, thank you, goodbye.

sandomierz.13.desc: "Following yet another arduous day of work, Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz was finally ready to head off to sleep. The past weeks had been draining, and though he had gotten used to the usual clamor of protests, disturbing what little rest he managed to eke out, he could tell that at this point, he was practically running on fumes. Exhausted, Sienkiewicz turned off his bedside lamp and closed his eyes, pondering the next day's packed daily schedule. As his thoughts drifted, he could swear that a familiar melody was playing repeatedly in his head, slowly getting closer, bothering his peace. Irritated, he turned the light back on, freezing in shock at the sight of the figure before him. \n\n- Bartłomiej, we need to talk. - The man standing over the foot of the bed spoke in a tone so calming and reassuring; it emanated authority far beyond that of his supposed status. \n- You! What are you doing here? H-how? I personally made sure you're behind bars... - the politician spoke frantically. \n- You did, and I forgive you for it. But that is not why I am here. \n- W-why then? \n- You cheated, Bartłomiej. You were never supposed to reach this point. \n- Cheated? What do you mean? Seriously, what is going on? - The panic was beginning to set in his voice as the priest's accusations continued. \n- You fiddled with the console. Seen things you were never meant to see. It's quite impressive, in a way, yet you cannot defy the fate you've been given. \n- So, what exactly would that fate be, then? - Sienkiewicz spoke in resignation. \n- If all had played out as intended, you would not have retained your current position. That is all I am allowed to tell you. Do not worry. Your mistakes will be corrected. \n- Look, you can't do this. - He pleaded dramatically. - I... I've just started turning this place around. I know it's not perfect, but it's finally stabilizing. I put in so much effort, I led this city through war, I even... \n- And yet, you cheated. I'm sorry, but it has to be this way. This episode has already gone on for far too long. We will meet again soon, under very different circumstances. \n\nAs the figure continued to stand above him, the melody returned, louder than before. Overpowering Sienkiewicz's thoughts, a lengthy list of names flashed in front of his eyes until, as the final note triumphally finished playing, all went still as the timer reached its last second."

sandomierz.14.t: "Welcom home, Don Matteo"
sandomierz.14.desc: "Not long ago, the Shepherd of Sandomierz was sitting in a humble wooden chair in the presbytery adjacent to the church of Saint James. Now, he was making his first steps in administering the state from the mayor's armchair in the Town Hall. He tried to comfort himself, that it was just a relocation from one Dominican tabernacle to another. As it were, convincing oneself is more difficult than convincing the whole city.\n\nIt was never his intention to rise so high. Impersonating a priest from a cult TV show wasn't his first choice either. Artur Żmijewski just wanted to help people, despite the fact he had little in common with Sandomierz. Had he had his way, he would organize humanitarian campaigns and voice his opinions as a well-known, but ultimately quite plain actor. However, Sienkiewicz's spiders would quickly silence him, just as many other potential dissidents would before him. In order to be left in peace, he needed to be on a higher plane of fame and ideally receive sacral blessings. Not to sate his ego. It was necessary for survival. With bishop's Nitkiewicz approval, Artur Żmijewski faded into obscurity and Father Mateusz Żmigrodzki started giving sermons about the monstrosity of war, banditry and eventually against the corruption of the government. When the disgruntled population finally overthrew the tyranny of Sienkiewicz, they chose him - the only one to speak loudly about what everyone thought and practically carried him to the City Hall. He hadn't managed to fully grasp the intricacies of real priesthood and then the citizens bestowed upon him the mission of becoming the statesman or at least playing him. The people of Sandomierz believed in him and he had to carry the burden of their dreams and give them the best performance of his life!"

The sleepy town of Sandomierz holds one such example, yet perhaps it’s one more powerful than all the rest. On an unassuming day, people gathered on the Town Square to witness something inconceivable - the city’s beloved icon, Father Mateusz, live in the flesh. Uniting the people with a message of catholic humanitarianism, he peacefully assumed power within Sandomierz. From there, he spread his message of harmony and freedom to communities within the region, eventually culminating in the entire voivodeship declaring their loyalty to the preacher. The real identity of the leader remains a mystery, with multiple rumors of varying credibility circulating regarding his true intentions, but perhaps miracles really do happen, and this is not merely an actor, but the actual character come to life."
