 POLITICS_BARTLOMIEJ_SIENKIEWICZ_DESC: "Up to this date Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz holds credit for the most accurate description of the condition of Polish state: §t"it exists only in theory... Cock, ass and a shitton of rocks"§!. These words, though not initially about Poland as a whole, are also an example of self-fulfilling prophecy, as the Poles believed them long enough that, one day, boom - they were 100%, literally, applicable to a letter. \n\nSienkiewicz, however, would not like them to be true. He was never the one to content himself with doing little. As one of the most active and prominent members of the Civic Platform and Tusk's strong-arm, he hated Law and Justice with passion - which made him a prime target for the remnants of the ancien regime. After unsuccessful attempt to organize resistance in his hometown of Kielce, he was forced to flee east to Sandomierz, forming one of the last redoubts against encroaching Ziobro's forces. \n\nThis is not a simple headhunt. Sienkiewicz is a symbol of what Law and Justice considers to be the source of evil. An educated, slick, anticlerical liberal, his image was cemented the moment he was spied on in a high-end restaurant in Warsaw, formulating his aforementioned definition. The whole PiS could thank Sienkiewicz, for if they could not use his figure as an allegory of Civic Platform arrogance, they would not seize power. Now, the show nears its grand finale, and Sienkiewicz has to fall. \n\nBut Sienkiewicz won't fall. He was an actual, experienced Minister of Interior, unlike PiS lackeys, and unlike them, he did not put life into his prophecy with his own hands. Sandomierz will remain a free, European city, a beacon to cling to in face of despotism. No matter the cost."
 
 POLITICS_OJCIEC_MATEUSZ_DESC: "In the late twenties, much like the whole country, the historic city of Sandomierz has gone through proverbial hell, emerging from one catastrophe only to end up facing another. Though the town was largely spared from the Fall's immediate devastation, the nation's collapse nonetheless shattered the blissful status quo previously enjoyed by the residents. In a time filled with constant uncertainty, where any new day could bring either conflict, unrest, or famine, Father Mateusz represents that which the city most needed - a calm guiding hand to reassure the weary populace. For the poor souls unable to cope with the damage brought upon by the Fall and its subsequent consequences, the priest stands as a final beacon of hope to rally behind, however unproven and idealistic he may be. \n\nDespite his rapid ascent, the man bearing the beloved persona never intended to be the city's hero. At no point did he claim to be an authentic representation of the character he played, nor strive for any spotlight beyond that which his contract stipulated. But as the internal situation in Sandomierz deteriorated and trust towards the city's leadership reached an unprecedented low, the initially playful, in-character greetings quickly gave way to concerned citizens desperately turning for advice to the sole remaining authority they still trusted; the only one who showed genuine concern for their wellbeings. In many ways, Father Mateusz represents the city's collective delusion, a desire to cling to normalcy even as the world around it crumbles - a piece of fiction supposedly brought to life, a priest without ordainment, a masterful detective lacking any formal training - the contradictions matter little to those with nothing else to believe in. \n\nElevated as the city's savior on a wave of ubiquitous public support and met with thousands of expectant hearts, hoping he'll solve all of its numerous problems, Father Mateusz was cast into a position he always hoped he'd avoid. Yet, though he may otherwise steer way clear of any political power and the excesses to which it inevitably leads, the 'priest' has no choice but to wield it in full - for them, and for the millions left struggling in the remains what once used to be Poland - forgotten, alone, and afraid. To show everyone that the humanitarian spirit can survive even in the darkest of times and that though all may seem to be lost, the combined, selfless efforts of a caring community can always bring about a better tomorrow."

 SND_war_censorship_desc: "In times of a great disarray, a little bending of media rules is not as much as allowed as it is necessary. We can't let enemies spread disinformation and propaganda from within our country. Instead, it's better if we do it ourselves. For the greater good. For the Republic."

 SND_cityonahill: "Shining City on a Hill"
 SND_cityonahill_desc: "Sandomierz, an unscarred beacon within a beacon of peace! Tucked away in a corner where no war or violence can truly reach it, Sandomierz stands above most other cities, as even when war broke out in the Holy Cross Voivodeship the city stood far away from it. With prior help of the now defunct Ukrainian Humanitarian Mission a stable and powerful city grows."

 SND_disgruntledpop1: "Disgruntled Population"
 SND_disgruntledpop1_desc: "The people of Sandomierz cry out! Left annoyed and angered at the continuation of the War with Ziobro, and Sienkiewicz authoritative hold over the government. The people must be staved off for Sandomierz to stand, especially against Ziobro."
 
 SND_disgruntledpop2: "Outraged Population"
 SND_disgruntledpop2_desc: "Oh god... fires rage in the streets as the people finally realize, with the ending of the War with Ziobro, that their current administration and state is desolate and on its own, with minor help from Starachowice not being enough, and Sienkiewicz thinking too far ahead for a small city, the balance in Sandomierz is put at risk."

 SND_antipriest_sienkiewicz: "Fanatic Countermeasures"
 SND_antipriest_sienkiewicz_desc: "The seat of the government is on fire! Father Mateusz challenges the seat of rule in Sandomierz and Sienkiewicz's response is to strip the church in Sandomierz?! The people grow angrier and angrier as the city goes red with rage! The little city has been poisoned by the big city and now a timer ticks down for Sienkiewicz and his administration."
 
 SND_kamienna_trade: "Trade Upon Kamienna's Banks"
 SND_kamienna_trade_desc: "Trade has truly borne the fruits of flourishment, as this trade partnership is truly magnificent! Although both Sandomierz and Starachowice aren't truly known for much, the two states work better as trade partners than combat partners. And the economies and the economic growth of both minor states are greatly bolstered."
 
 SND_crime2: "Countering the Axiom"
 SND_crime2_desc: "The fight against crime can be fully realized! With the advent of a properly put together police force, and the help of Father Mateusz in solving crimes, for the first time since conflict began against the Prosecutorship, there has been a decrease in crime rates! May Sandomierz truly become a star amongst dull lights."
 
 SND_army_of_saints: "Army of Saints"
 SND_army_of_saints_desc: "Development of the army ensues. Many things would have their introduction into the military, like civilized rules of engagement, likened to that of the Geneva Convention. Proper military tactics and organization, unlike that of the guerrilla militias in the fight against the Prosecutorship. And the addition and focusing on advancing field hospitals to allow for lessened casualties."

 SND_holy_alliance_desc: "Amongst the darkened map that is Poland, a lighthouse, bright as the sun, stands proud throughout it! As the alliance between Sandomierz and Starachowice has been finalized, it is a great, albeit surprising and fairly lucky, precedent set amongst the corpse of Poland."
 
 SND_halfhearted_strikes: "Halfhearted Strikes"
 SND_halfhearted_strikes_desc: "With the fall of Starachowice, unionist leader Piotr Ikonowicz leads various dissidents across the city, although impartial in true intention, it still shows the precedent that the current government is on a partial down spiral, and may fall off its tower."

 SND_handling_economy_1: "Handling The Economy" 
 SND_handling_economy_1_desc: "Liberal approach to the economy has left many people poor and starving. We must shift our priorities so the economy of our country can finally be used for something good, not only as a tool for making money. Hopefully we can do something with our limited resources, so we must be creative and listen to the needs of the people."

 SND_price_prevention: "The Price of Prevention"
 SND_price_prevention_desc: "PLACEHOLDER"

 SND_teatime: "Afternoon Tea"
 SND_teatime_desc: "Sometimes you just need to take a breath, sit down for some tea and cake, confess your sins, and maybe play a game of chess. Father Mateusz gladly welcomes guests to his presbytery - to better understand the troubles of his flock, grow closer to them and sometimes just listen, and by listening - help. Warm words, warm smile, warm tea. Just that, and yet so much more."
 ###   First Tree   ###
 
SND_dusk_in_royal_city: "Dusk in the Royal City"
SND_dusk_in_royal_city_desc: "Ahh, Sandomierz... the one place that the Fall failed to reach. Where the quiet cobbled streets still lead life at the same pace as they did for the past centuries. The royal city - an oasis of peace and home for all those fleeing persecution. The brightest light shining across a region that has otherwise descended into darkness. Even if Poland continues to fragment, and each of these fragments devotes itself to fighting the others, the Republic of Sandomierz will continue to stand above them all, free of the devastation they bring upon the country. And in time, the city will return to its full, historic glow, and nothing shall disturb its peace, unless..."
  
SND_so_long_peace: "So Long, Peace..."
SND_so_long_peace_desc: "...unless Ziobro comes in to finish the job. Of course. And it just had to be on Christmas of all days. As if he ever had any shame. For 'harboring the known criminal Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz, sentenced to lifetime imprisonment by the lawful government of the Third Republic,' he declared our Republic a rogue state and sent his men to end its sovereignty. What a pathetic excuse. Through what backward logic does this reason justify the simultaneous invasion of Starachowice? The truth is - the Prosecutor is out for blood, and he won't stop until the whole voivodeship kneels before him. But rather than become yet another obedient satrapy, we will fight to defend our freedom. The odds may be overwhelmingly against us, but if we can at least slightly rough him up before it's over, that should count as a moral victory."
  
SND_turn_media_attention: "Turn Media Attention to the War"
SND_turn_media_attention_desc: "There's a time for media pluralism, but with a hostile army rapidly encroaching on our territory, every other outlet blasting critiques of the administration is the last thing we need. So, let's get our stories straight: if you enjoy having liberties - the Prosecutorship is going to take them all away. If you wear a red heart, a green clover, or anything that isn't that damn blue eagle on your chest, you WILL face persecution if we lose this war. And if you just as much as looked at him wrong or wrote some disparaging decade-old comment you've since long forgotten about - §RZIOBRO. IS. COMING. TO. GET. YOU.§! On every channel, down to the most irrelevant regional station, this message better be the main story."
  
SND_in_for_the_long_haul: "In for the Long Haul"
SND_in_for_the_long_haul_desc: "Months of deadlock, one step back after another... and we're still acting like it's business as usual. Unless we want to burn ourselves out and realize one day that what little remains of our stockpiles has run dry, it's time to start taking some drastic measures. The fields we still control up north are not even close to covering existing demand. It's either rations now or famine in a month. For now, we can start off simple - some minor restrictions on the number of purchasable goods allowed per person should be enough to prevent the worst shortages. And if the people don't like it - well, it's still far better than the alternative."

SND_demonize_their_forces: "Demonize Their Forces"
SND_demonize_their_forces_desc: "The early months of the war have shown that most soldiers aren't particularly eager to kill their fellow countrymen, even if they're Ziobrites. Squeezing any effectiveness out of our troops will require the right incentives... and a good mental picture. We need to drill the image into everyone's minds - the men beyond our frontlines aren't their brothers. They're ruthless, single-minded killers who, if they hadn't been co-opted into Ziobro's ranks, would likely be pillaging and burning villages for fun instead. So unless they want these dogs to do as they please, every able-bodied person better give their all for the Republic, for their families, and for everyone else in the city who can't defend themselves."

SND_call_more_volunteers: "Call on More Volunteers"
SND_call_more_volunteers_desc: "People across Sandomierz weep, as the war effort has begun to stall out with a lack of manpower. This is no good! For if the cogs slow down, and momentum stops and possibly switches we may all crumble in this conflict. So it's time for the media to crank out propaganda on the scale of the various Media-Conglomerates! With the help of studying the various propaganda that the US media puts out, we may find a way to put out similarly ABSURD propaganda."

SND_against_battered_giant: "Against the Battered Giant"
SND_against_battered_giant_desc: "The audacity Ziobro has, his people have suffered in this war and he continues it, even with his army and his populace's war exhaustion, he really has turned into a brute, a fake Caesar. With Ziobro's declaration to keep the war going, even with the losses he has suffered, a renewed sense of patriotism spikes all throughout Sandomierz. While this happens in Sandomierz, the opposite happens in the Prosecutorship, Ziobro's forces begin to feel the effects of the prolonged war, exhaustion truly sets in with his forces practically sleep depraved, morale crumbles as the war gets more and more unfavorable, now is the time to batter the giant further."

SND_rudimentary_ambush_tactics: "Rudimentary Partisan Tactics"
SND_rudimentary_ambush_tactics_desc: "Ziobro and his offensive are beginning to weather on our defense of Iron! This may be time to enact truly interesting battle tactics, like a lesser Vietcong. Minor traps, Hit and Run and general destabilizing tactics can now be adapted into our main battle plan and main tactics. Against Ziobro's poorly trained militias, and with a little bit of training whether it be trial by fire or out-of-battle training, these tactics may truly puncture Ziobro!"

SND_build_temporary_fortifications: "Build up Temporary Fortifications"
SND_build_temporary_fortifications_desc: "With the advent of Ziobro and his forces' fierce attacks, Sandomierz and its high command have all agreed it'd be a good idea to build up temporary, but good nonetheless fortifications. Minor trench networks, woodland camps, punji sticks and many more. The people of Sandomierz have even turned out in support for this military act, with many various small or minor volunteer corps forming to help accelerate the construction of the temporary fortifications."

SND_start_renewed_offensive: "Start a Renewed Offensive"
SND_start_renewed_offensive_desc: "The order shall be given! With Ziobro's crumble and the Prosecutorships forces waning completely, the time to truly push has come. All field commanders have been given the strict order to attack, with a force beyond that of our enemies understanding and a ferocity to claw a bear to the ground. With this order one constant is seen, the probability of territorial growth, the giant may crumble under our pressure and lose land while we gain many territorial concessions from them. But before that we must leave them a shell, an empty shell with nothing but bloodied soil inside of it."

SND_our_future_secured: "Our Future Secured?"
SND_our_future_secured_desc: "Huh, it's... actually over. It's almost hard to believe, but despite the overwhelming assault of Ziobro's forces, somehow, we are still standing. So... that means the hard part should be behind us now, right? It's not like we've thrown everything we have at the enemy, angered our own people in the process, let the domestic situation deteriorate far beyond our control, absolutely ruined the city's economy, left absolutely no opportunities for the returning veterans, canceled all... is there even a point to keep listing everything that is currently wrong with Sandomierz? We have our work cut out for us. Now's no time for celebrations."

###   Sandomierz Post-War Tree   ###

SND_war_fallout: "The War's Fallout"
SND_war_fallout_desc: "Alright, new beginnings. It's time to roll up our sleeves and tackle the unending multitude of problems and instability otherwise referred to as post-war Sandomierz. Somehow, the fact that we've just defeated a Ziobrist invasion seems to barely matter in the eyes of a surprisingly large minority, blaming us for allowing the situation to deteriorate this far in the first place. Whatever. Their anger will blow over once we start bringing in concrete results. We just have to... umm... we can start with... Fine; restoring this city to its former glory... or even a somewhat passable state may prove to be slightly more difficult than we would've hoped."

SND_confused_approaches: "Confused Approaches"
SND_confused_approaches_desc: "In response to the population's calls for immediate action, we have proudly met all of their demands and delivered decisive moves - established the Exploratory Committee to Tackle the Social Woes and War Damage within the City of Sandomierz and the Surrounding Counties. In only a short few months, we should be able to present the first preliminary findings, and then, it'll only be a while before we recruit the right people to start getting things done. Only a sensible approach could hope to mitigate the...  why is nobody clapping? Seriously, what's with all the booing and jeering? We're trying to help you out, people! This stuff takes time!"

SND_dealing_with_economy: "Dealing with the Economy"
SND_dealing_with_economy_desc: "So yeah... let's tackle the economy. Well, technically, there isn't really any economy to handle, so at least we have a somewhat blank slate. The negative? The fact that WE BARELY HAVE ANY ECONOMY TO SPEAK OF. Sure, we have a couple of mid-sized factories, a bunch of minor private enterprises, and even some badly damaged infrastructure, but that really shouldn't be the source of any pride. Unless we are fine with forever remaining a provincial backwater carried only on the shoulders of its history, we need to actually start carrying out some meaningful investments."

SND_pilkington_glassworks: "Expansion of the Pilkington Glassworks"
SND_pilkington_glassworks_desc: "The Pilkington Industrial Complex has always been a trustworthy ally, providing our regime with financial backing that proved indispensable in holding back against Ziobro. It would only be appropriate to return the favor, especially since the success of our corporate allies plays into our own. After all, is there anyone who would object to us providing new job opportunities for the unemployed or establishing a foundation for our future exports? The expansion of Pilkington is far more than just a handout. It's a sign the Republic is about to become a meaningful regional player."

SND_sandomierz_opatow_railway: "Sandomierz-Opatów Railway"
SND_sandomierz_opatow_railway_desc: "The patchwork of railway lines left behind by the Third Republic is an unfortunate mismatch with the geography of our nation, to say the least. The current link from Sandomierz is immediately cut off by the borders of Subcarpathia on both sides, effectively locking us out from utilizing rail freight in any reasonable capacity. But what luck won't give us, we'll accomplish ourselves anyway. The line from the capital to our forward outpost in Opatów will be the start of a network that's eventually going to link all noteworthy towns to the central nexus in Sandomierz... in the somewhat distant future."

SND_tradeport_on_vistula: "Building a Tradeport on the Vistula"
SND_tradeport_on_vistula_desc: "The Fall did wonders in revitalizing trade across Poland's waterways. Generally, attacking an armored boat in the middle of a river that provides clear visibility is a slightly tougher ordeal than setting up an ambush in any random forested or hilly stretch of a poorly maintained road. Our partners are looking for safety, so if we want to keep them on board and expand our reach beyond the borders of the first hostile warlord that stands in the way of our traders, it'd be a good option to turn some of the undeveloped moorlands into a port capable of sending out vessels across the entire length of the Vistula."

SND_repairing_north_roads: "Repairing the Roads North"
SND_repairing_north_roads_desc: "It's hard to project any degree of control over our territories when the second you exit the capital's administrative borders, the roads immediately start becoming an unmaintained, pothole-infested nightmare.  How can we expect to maintain regular supply chains between Sandomierz and our regional bastions up north when anything larger than a family van has trouble making it across? It's time to start thinking beyond the scope of our city. Besides, a couple of maintenance crews should be enough to do the job. It's not that long of a distance, anyway. How much could there realistically be to fix?"

SND_new_powerlines: "Kickstart Our Power Grid"
SND_new_powerlines_desc: "It's pitiful and, honestly, incredibly telling proof of the miserable state of the country that most of the countryside still doesn't have power because... the people stole all the wiring while the Fall was still taking place. Since the power usage plummeted, we had to cut corners with our power plants, be it the central one located in Sandomierz, or the local renewables in the countryside. They could all use a fix and while we could technically raid the junkyards they traded their loot to for quick cash and any other useful parts, but unlike what some of our citizens claim, we're actually a benevolent government that doesn't mind spending a portion of its operating budget to reconnect our villages to the modern world. Just uhh... once we're done installing the missing cables, let's post some guards to make sure they don't end up getting pilfered again."

SND_dwikozy_cannery: "Expanding the Dwikozy Preserves Factory"
SND_dwikozy_cannery_desc: "The agricultural cooperative in Dwikozy remains one of the few bright spots we can rely on in terms of domestic production. But while its output effortlessly dwarfs that of most other enterprises, we have been granted the perfect opportunity to turn it into a nationwide giant. Think about it - when is the demand for canned goods at its highest? In times of crisis, when everyone is frantically stocking up on non-perishables. And oh, we sure are in one massive crisis. If we expand our production, we could easily have our products stacked in bunkers from Gdańsk to Zakopane and beyond."

SND_dealing_with_crime: "Dealing with the Crime"
SND_dealing_with_crime_desc: "You can never fully prevent crime - not around these parts, and definitely not in our current situation. Some poor souls will always wander into the wrong neighborhood, and certain items are bound to go missing. That's just the way of life. What we can't tolerate, however, is when one of our ministers has his house broken into in the middle of the day, and the police prove unable to do ANYTHING about it. That's it. We've had enough. This open lawlessness is coming to an end. We will not tolerate anarchy on the streets of our beautiful city!"

SND_extraordinary_commission: "Extraordinary Commission for the Matters of Crime"
SND_extraordinary_commission_desc: "If one commission isn't enough to tackle the recent increase in criminality,  we must take an unprecedented move and establish YET. ANOTHER. COMMISSION. That's right. The full might of two dozen seasoned legislative experts is about to bear down on anyone foolish enough to challenge the rule of law. Already, our informants within certain prominent criminal organizations report that the bosses tremble in the face of our rational, measured approach to the issue. All we need to do is find an appropriate consensus solution that will satisfy the concerns of everyone involved, and we're good to go. And that should happen soon... ish."

SND_police_funding_bill: "Police Funding Bill"
SND_police_funding_bill_desc: "While our current budget looks bleak at best, some actions are necessary enough for us to gladly go temporarily into the red. The local police have the operating budget of a village housewives' association, successfully turning just about everyone away from joining the force while those that still serve are forced to survive on a regular series of handouts and bribes. If we want our servicemen to finally start doing their jobs and crush the neverending crime wave, we have to drastically increase their funding, up to the point of overkill if necessary. Consequences be damned."

SND_cameras_at_every_corner: "Cameras at Every Street Corner"
SND_cameras_at_every_corner_desc: "Our main issue with persecuting the criminals still happily terrorizing Sandomierz is the fact we can't prove pretty much anything. Most of the time, we're left relying on the sole testimony of some 70-year-old half-blind pensioner who, in the dark of night, couldn't distinguish between a suspect and a sufficiently large trash bag. If the eyes on the ground can't be trusted, we'll have to install our own. With cameras monitoring all streets and staring into the forgotten depths of every dark alley, there won't be a single thing in this city that is allowed to go unseen."

SND_reopen_castle_prison: "Reopen the Castle Prison"
SND_reopen_castle_prison_desc: "The people demand crackdowns? Oh, we'll give them crackdowns. In fact, we're going to be so effective; we'll need some additional space to keep all the criminals, troublemakers, vagabonds, and the like behind bars. Luckily for us, there's a slightly crude solution that could increase our prison capacity by almost 50% without incurring any extra costs. Over the centuries, the castle cellar has often been used as a makeshift dun... jail. The comparisons to past regimes that utilized this solution are bound to be unflattering, but if we shuffle the museum pieces clogging up the former cells elsewhere, we could easily fill the place up with just about anyone we need to keep out of public view."

SND_dealing_with_priest: "Dealing with the Priest"
SND_dealing_with_priest_desc: "Of course, there's always one. Always some ungrateful troublemaker who thinks he could do a better job than experienced government officials. In the current state of the Republic, we can't afford the people turning to some other imagined parallel authority, much less one as absurd as a fake wannabe pretending to be a fictional priest. Seriously, are we the only ones seeing through this nonsense? He may seem harmless now, but with the attention he's been attracting, this 'Father Mateusz' could soon become a threat. We have no choice but to expose him for who he really is - nothing but a fraud."

SND_push_against_church: "Subtly Push Back Against the Church"
SND_push_against_church_desc: "Everyone's afraid to face it, but the Catholic Church is quite likely the worst parasite infesting the Polish lands. The excesses of its leaders show that the Kler serve nothing but their own vain self-interest, all while hurling moral judgment and stirring dissent against every reasonable secular government. We can't take them on outright, not yet at least, but we can plant the first seeds of doubt in the people's minds. We were able to acquire sensitive information regarding some of the Church's more... suspect dealings. It would be such a shame if that knowledge were to be suddenly leaked to every single media outlet in Sandomierz."

SND_plant_provocateurs: "Plant Provocateurs at Meetings"
SND_plant_provocateurs_desc: "If the priest won't say or do anything controversial on his own, we'll make him do it instead. A group of our loyal agitators will follow his every step, waiting for any opening, any opportunity to strike, and then, when he least expects it, they'll challenge him in front of the crowds. We'll see how well this supposed 'humanitarian nature' of his holds when dealing with our provocateurs. We just know he'll crack and say something that we can latch on to - something that will forever ruin the fake image he's building around himself. All we need to do is wait."

SND_stanislaw_of_szczepanowo: "Stanisław of Szczepanowo"
SND_stanislaw_of_szczepanowo_desc: "We've been left with no other choice. 'Father Mateusz' is a dangerous lunatic, and for the sake of the Republic, we won't let him question our rule any longer. With a favorable enough interpretation, we could technically label his actions as calling for the overthrow of our government, giving us just cause to temporarily arrest him until tempers calm down and we've solidified our position. The people will surely get angry, and we are bound to face severe backlash, but detaining the so-called priest is the only appropriate course of action. In time, they will thank us for it."

While many are still preoccupied with celebrations as if this is the end of all our problems, they keep forgetting that we have to actually... run the place. We've already wasted far too much time triumphally parading around the area without accomplishing a single thing of note. At this point, it's almost becoming comical. We're calling everyone back. No more victory laps until we figure out a realistic plan on how we're to govern our spoils."

SND_expand_our_administration: "Expand Our Administration"
SND_expand_our_administration_desc: "The one thing we can't complain about the lack of is the overwhelming number of seasoned administrators - most still out of a job. There's just something about Ziobro's rampant political persecution and the forcible removal of anyone unwilling to comply with his militant, unlawful agenda that makes local officials flee to the one place in the voivodeship that actually functions like a real democracy. And now, after months of discouraging idleness, they're desperate to get back out there and return to their cushy positions in the local bureaucracy. Fortunately, we have the perfect news for the most able and ideologically suitable among them."

The blow we've dealt the Prosecutorship is far from fatal, and it's only going to embolden them even further. The gloves are off, so unless we want to find out just how far their vengefulness goes, we better be prepared to not give them even an inch of our territory. A rudimentary line of border forts is far from a guarantee of safety, but it's better than nothing once the armageddon starts."

SND_towards_new_tomorrow_desc: "The past few months have been tough, perhaps even more so than the war, but what matters is - we're still holding on. From a seemingly unwinnable war to a supposedly unsolvable crisis, we have shown resilience far beyond what nearly everyone expected. And though we're still widely despised and the challenges before us remain just as daunting as before, we can start working on implementing a long-term plan instead of just reacting to whatever new issue pops up this time. Maybe eventually, this place won't be such an unbearable and ungrateful backwater after all."

SND_rebirth_of_faith_desc: "Choosing neither of the two partisan evils that plagued Poland before the Fall, the people of Sandomierz overcame them with good. With the shackles of the old system cast away, they declared popular half-legitimate preacher, Father Mateusz Żmigrodzki - the living embodiment of a beloved fictional hero - to be their shepherd. A highly controversial figure, he is seen by many as the last good priest in Poland, a blasphemer by some, and a misguided idealist by others. Nevertheless, he's certainly the only possible ruler in the Sandomierzan power vacuum, so even his most staunch opponents refrain from drastic actions against him until they find a suitable pretender. That time may give 'Mateusz' time to consolidate his power. We shall see how a man with little experience with being a priest and even less experience with being a politician will fare at his new task."

Oh, sure Sienkiewicz government made some half-baked attempts to help our industrial sector by introducing some symbolic tax cuts and financial relief programs. Those methods however were too minuscule to make any substantial difference. Now it's time for true help, social spending coupled with government contracts will help to light the spark to our production. Especially, the pride of Sandomierz, Pilkington glassworks. Hmm... perhaps a purchase of new stained windows is in order?"

SND_historical_market_desc: "Once a center of Sandomierz's trade, then a historical landmark, harboring cafes and small souvenir shops aimed at enchanting tourists with its beauty. With the breakdown in trade and lack of funds for renovation, it fails both tasks. With enough care put into it, we can renovate the gothic tenements and the town hall. Thanks to that, when we open the town market to the extended trade similar to that of medieval times. Encouraged by the ancient beauty of the heart of Sandomierz, traders will flock to our town to engage in fair transactions under the watchful eye of the Immaculate Mother of God. Soon goods transported from the east through National Road 77 and from the south through boats on Vistula will enrich our citizens."

While the loess and fluvisol soils surrounding Sandomierz are excellent for agriculture, we still aren't able to produce enough to feed everyone. Even then the fruits of farmers' labor are not diversified enough to enable those who can satiate their hunger to receive all necessary nutrients. This issue could be helped by the foreign caravans. That however takes time and a qualified businessman and businesswoman specialized in food retail. They, however, need the capital to do so and many of them went down during those turbulent times. Introducing government loans with low lending rates could help them stand on their own and provide much-needed services to the citizens."

SND_soup_kitchens_desc: "Food in Sandomierz is now more available. People are sated, but that is still not enough for Father Mateusz, who can't sit idly when hunger, though curtailed, is still rampant among the population. True welfare will come once, the trade finally reestablishes itself on the territories under the guidance of Apostles of Christ. Maybe then after the surplus of food increases the horrendous prices will drop as the Żmigrodzki's sermons resulted only in the minute change on the market. Until a more prosperous future comes, the government should take matters into its own hands and start numerous soup kitchens offering cheap fare to those who need it the most. If need be, Father Mateusz himself will serve the poor to lead by example."

Some come from far away, attracted by the legend of a beloved priest from Sandomierz, who came to life to help the poor. No matter where they come from, they all flee from the same - destruction brought by war, destroyed cities, and burned villages. They are already here and sending them away would be heartless. And dangerous if they disapproved of such action. Thus it is our duty to provide them with even the most humble abodes. Right now quantity is more important than quality and though most shelters will take the form of tents and huts found only in the worst of slums. This however is just a temporary measure. In time, some wanderers will leave our nation and then we'll undertake a genuine social housing programme."

Alas, Sandomierz is surrounded by numerous enemies ready to vanquish all of the achievements the Apostles have made and persecute the population of Sandomierz. We are far from the times of Messianic Peace. As such we will need to forge swords. And a lot of water will flow under Sandomierz bridge before we'd beat them into plowshares. Unfortunately, there are few forges in our nation. Truth be told, there's hardly any heavy industry in Sandomierz, despite the small glasswork. We need to change that. The faithful may have expected the continuation of welfare programs and not an industrial source of noise and pollution. Nevertheless, the Shepherd must take necessary actions to protect his herd. Popular or otherwise."

Brave people of Starachowice also raised against the General Persecutor. In times when many traded reason for madness they remained as a bastion of moderation and common sense. They also happen to be our close neighbors and thanks to relative safety on the roads both our citizens are able to travel with reasonable ease from one nation to the other. Now that we have begun bringing life to our fledling industrial sector, it is only natural for us to engage in mutual trade. We can offer them toughened glass much needed in the automotive industry as well as stationery and feed for the animals. In turn, we would be most interested in their famous STAR truck for both civilian and military purposes."

SND_getting_our_hands_dirty: "Getting Our Hands Dirty"
SND_getting_our_hands_dirty_desc: "Pre-Fall Sandomierz was never as violent as portrayed in the Father Matthew television series. The show's dramatic and often far-fetched criminal plots once seemed like an exaggerated fiction. Ironically, compared to the current state of the city's streets, those plots now appear almost idyllic. Today, Sandomierz is plagued by daily occurrences of murder, armed robbery, and a flourishing drug trade. It would be wiser to let professional policemen handle the situation, however, the acute mind and the ability to solve crimes are the most recognizable traits of the character of Mateusz Żmigrodzki.  His sharp mind and unshakable moral compass must serve as a symbol of hope for the people. That is precisely why his hands-on involvement in Sandomierz's most notorious cases is non-negotiable.  It's time for Mateusz to roll up his sleeves, mount a humble bicycle, and restore peace to the streets of the city."

The treacherousness, the underhandedness, the corruption, the mismanagement of Sandomierz, tarnishing of the good name of Henryk Sienkiewicz's family are but a few of his faults. But even the greatest sinner is capable of good. And if anything good can be said about Sienkiewicz it's his commitment to fight crime and keep an extensive act archives. While he destroyed many files that directly involved his activities and crimes were destroyed during his escape, practically all of the papers regarding the criminal underworld in Sandomierz are untouched. The suspects, the evidence, and the descriptions of cases that were untimely ended are at our disposal. It would be a shame not to use them, as they would significantly fasten the progress of catching criminals. They may even help us uncover gangs and cases we've not yet discovered."

SND_friends_in_blue: "Friends in Blue Places"
SND_friends_in_blue_desc: "The truth in both television and reality is that Father Mateusz cannot work as a vigilante, disregarding the experienced police and military officers. The lack of coordination or signs of mutiny would be catastrophic for our nation. On the other hand, Father Mateusz needs his iconic crew to be seen in high positions in his government, naturally replacing said experienced officers by taking their seats. Thankfully, both the current minister of war, Colonel Grzegorz Kobylarz, and the head of Sandomierz's police force, Deputy Inspector Grzegorz Jaworski can be generally considered enthusiasts of Mateusz's rule. Let us hope, they'll understand and accept the decision of appointing Orest Możejko, another character from the TV show as their new superior despite his apparent lack of experience. Żmigrodzki will have to use all of his experience to convince them with all of the benevolence and wit of the fictional archetype."

Military bicycles emerged at the turn of the 19th century. They have been used by dedicated military units, the Italian, German, and Japanese armies. Military bicycles provide a method of transportation, communication, and reconnaissance. And those operations can be carried out more silently when compared to the performance of power-driven vehicles. They're also cheaper than cars and their usage is more humane than the assistance of horses. Not to mention that a trusty bike is an iconic method of transportation for Father Matthew. While ideally, we'd use special bikes designed for warfare, with a more capacious carrier, we'll have to make do with regular civilian bikes sold and donated by our citizens."

Despite all they've done, the prisoners are still people. People who have been pushed to the extreme by the extreme circumstances caused by the collapse of the Polish state. They've come to believe that you can only get by ruthlessness. Who else will show them the right path but us? In our incarceration policy, we'll put the strongest possible emphasis on rehabilitation. While searching for professional psychologists, social workers, and priests will require much effort and generate additional costs in the short term. In due time, however, this method will be cheaper than indefinite incarceration, especially when the inmates become moral and productive members of society."

SND_as_long_as_it_takes_desc: "The priority of the police and prison service is primarily to ensure the safety of the population. As cruel as it may seem, separating the wheat from the chaff is our top priority, even if it means some will get harsher sentences. With our humble resources, few judges, and mental health specialists, our police chief estimates that practically all of the criminals will end up with life sentences. Crude and barbaric. But we can't hope for more when we have other priorities and enemies at our gates. Regrettable turn of events. In his heart, Żmijewski swears that when the storm upon Vistula calms, inmates will be able to send the appeal and those deserving will receive shorter sentences. That is why we need to make haste to bring law and morality to Poland, so the Apostles' mission will be able to take its intended shape."

And still, there are a ton of files that gather dust in the archives. Even so, the streets of Sandomierz are already visibly safer, even though the Father's work is not done yet. Make no mistake: Mateusz won't rest on laurels and eventually will take care of them, even though not all of them will attract the media's attention, as the ones the Apostles have already dealt with. All in due time. As of now, we'll have to focus on the criminals that dwell beyond our borders."

SND_the_believers: "The Believers"
SND_the_believers_desc: "Large is the flock that follows Father Mateusz. Large, dedicated, but also divided. Some completely accept him as a legitimate priest and believe in his story. This group consists of declared Catholics. Many of them, so-called 'non-practicing' Catholics didn't even notice that Mateusz Żmigrodzki had never before been a parish priest in Sandomierz. Others are more skeptical. They wonder if Mateusz isn't just a creation of an actor. Some are damn sure he is. Nevertheless, they believe in his humanitarian cause, dedication to crime-fighting, and a chance for the renewed popularity of Catholicism. Despite their doubts or even certainty, they lay quiet not to jeopardize Father's cause or get attacked by more fanatical believers. The most prominent representative of the latter stance is Krzysztof Nitkiewicz - the Bishop who allowed Mateusz to operate in Sandomierz undisturbed."

SND_the_non_believers: "The Non-Believers"
SND_the_non_believers_desc: "When Thomas doubted in living, resurrected Jesus of flesh and bones, he touched the wounds of the Lord to believe. And then he truly has seen him. Nowadays, people see Father Matthew, hear him, and can touch him. Yet that is not enough. They form a strange amalgamation of contradictory beliefs. About half of them are atheists, agnostics, liberals, and skeptics. Mostly middle-class and city dwellers. They cannot believe how desperate the people of Sandomierz must have been to go along with what they call 'an obvious and ridiculous ploy'. Some of them are former supporters' of Sienkiewicz's regime. The other half consists of highly devoted Catholics. In their view 'Żmijewski's dress-up' is sacrilegious despite the local church authority's connivance. Thankfully, the non-believers are not as numerous and not well organized."

Aware of that, Father and his Apostles can't allow themselves to ignore the massive TV propaganda machine devised by Sienkiewicz. But what to do with it? It would be more moral to break up the massive state TV company and leave small local public stations and many small private news agencies. But would that be wise? After all the sheep need the shepherd, who'll guide them away from the dangers of straying away from the safe path. Perhaps, we can turn this evil conglomerate into a force of good?"

SND_first_time_into_breach_desc: "The time has come. Ever since Mateusz started his popular street preaching, every attendant wondered when they heard his wise and compassionate message in front of an altar. This day has finally come. Just in time. People were growing unease and unsure what caused forgoing the hitherto absence of Mateusz during the Masses. Mateusz just living in the presbytery, while avoiding any signs of ministration was indeed suspicious. As a result, the voices that he wasn't a real priest were getting louder and more numerous. Let's put an end to that. The experience Żmijewski had in playing priest should allow him to succeed at giving official sermons. Altar boys and acolytes will of course also be there to ensure everything goes smoothly."

SND_bike_trip_in_countryside: "Bike Trip through the Countryside"
SND_bike_trip_in_countryside_desc: "One of the greatest sins of the liberal elites is their focus on urban centers and in turn disregard for the countryside. It is the main reason that their government was toppled by the disgruntled masses. Alas, by focusing on planning his crusade against organized crime, Mateusz himself found himself focusing primarily on the city of Sandomierz. It's time to change the course of action. Firstly, people in the countryside need a clear symbol, that the government remembers about them. Organizing a mass pilgrimage-inspired bike trip, and visiting various villages would be a great idea to accomplish that. Inviting the citizens to undertake this journey with Mateusz will also turn the innocent trip into a support march. Or support ride, if you want to be specific. The procession growing with each visited village will be a truly inspiring sight for the people."

SND_teatime_at_presbitery: "Teatime at the Presbitery"
SND_teatime_at_presbitery_desc: "Approachability is the main asset of Father Mateusz. His calm demeanor, understanding look in his eyes, and accepting nature help him in uniting the citizens, softening his opponents, and encouraging criminals to repent. It gives people an ease of mind - a resource growing scarcer and scarcer. We can strengthen this feeling of comfort by organizing tea parties with Father Matthew, so they will feel that the government is really close to the common people. Once in a while, people will be able to sign up for the meetings with the priest-detective, during which they'll be able to tell them of their worries, chit-chat, and say a few words of appreciation for the government. We're sure those will prove themselves to be highly popular, however, those activities will distract Mateusz from his other duties such as crime-fighting."

To do that we need a complex hospital organization, educated specialists, and expensive equipment is hard to come by. It would be much easier to redirect the funds to the welfare system. Paying simple social benefits is a much simpler and still an effective way of helping those in need. It would be a step in the right direction, that however doesn't address the core of the issue. What's use has the sick for additional fun, when there's a shortage of medicine? Accomplishing either of those two projects is a daunting task, even if one is slightly easier and cheaper than the other. Not to mention, Father Mateusz would ideally want to complete both of them at the same time."

Beyond our borders lies a whole different world, where no Good Samaritans and peacemakers were able to establish benevolent order. New criminals not that dissimilar from those that tormented our citizens are ready to jump at each other's throats now that the hate for Ziobro no longer unifies them.

They hold allegiance to lofty goals of punishing a loosely defined "they" who always fits the description of whoever they wish to oppress next.

The Prosecutorship's precarious position brought him an opportunity for revenge. Riling up the crowds to his spiteful rallying cry, he fought now not only against Ziobro, but against any symbol that would bear any resemblance to his great, old enemy.

SND_limbo_desc: "Just as Jericho fell to the thunder of Israelite trumpets, so too shall we take Kielce. The people of this city suffer under misrule and hardship beyond measure. But a just and merciful fate awaits these souls oppressed by Tarczyński. This is the final step in our march to reclaim the entire voivodeship. No one expected much from us-ascetic pilgrims with nothing but will and faith. But today, it is we who will challenge the majesty of Kielce in the final battle. May God be merciful to our soldiers, and soon the people of this city shall know a warm embrace and a warm meal. But above all, it is our duty to help as many as we can. And the capital of the region... is the right place for such great deeds."

SND_mercury_desc: "Alpha and Omega. The Beginning and the End. It is done. The entire Holy Cross Voivodeship now stands under our banner. Those who did not believe have been shown the glory. Those who did believe can hardly comprehend that it truly happened. The skeptics spoke of hypocrisy, but it's hard to speak of such things when the reality is this: people live better lives now. Peace has prevailed, hunger is all but eradicated, and the lands once ravaged by war now bloom again, bathed in the morning rays of hope for the first time in ages.\n\nThere is truth in the idea that sometimes the most unexpected soul can show others the way - and the one who once merely practiced his craft out of habit now begins to believe in the power of his own deeds.\n\nGod has triumphed. And with Him, His blessed people, led by the Father."

sandomierz.1.t: "Ziobro surrenders!"
sandomierz.1.desc: "At around 9:30 AM Sandomierz troops, moving westward, have entered a tiny town, barely stretching outside the market square, just like many others in the region. Aside a roadblock about a kilometer earlier and a couple of marauding soldiers in a village off the main road, there was no resistance. The men didn't even try to fight, claiming that an armistice was already in effect and Ziobro's forces were all falling back. \n\nNevertheless, Sandomirians were told to exercise usual caution when rolling onto the square. As makeshift armoured truck switched its engine off, there was nothing but silence, a bit too eerie even for such a languishing place. The town was dead. Soldiers disembarked and knocked on a couple doors, trying to find any signs of a life form with at least middling intelligence. After a while, one of the doors opened, revealing a worn-out man. \n - Have you seen Ziobro's forces? - asked the Sandomirian sergeant. \n - Yeah, I've seen them. \n - Where are they now? \n - Upstairs - the man beckoned slightly towards the first floor. \n - How... how many of them? \n - Three platoons. \n\n - The windows in the house, as well as a few neighboring ones, opened, and out of each a couple of barrels, granades or makeshift throwing weapons emerged. \n - Commisar Zardecki, General Prosecutorship, nice to meet you. \n - Wwwasn't there supposed to be armistice already? - said the Sandomirian, taking a few cautious steps back from the doors to figure out the size of shit he found himself in. \n - You know, I actually have no idea. Give me a second, I'll call the HQ. \n\nCommisar reached for his assignated Nokia 3310 and started calling. \n- God, I hope I won't have to deal with that idiot again... Hi, could you tell me if the armistice already in effect? I see... Complete chaos? So I guess that's it? Alright.. Okay, thank you, goodbye. Stay safe. \n - Gentlemen - said the commisar - it seems there is no point for further hostilities. If you allow us, we shall leave the town and fall back. Men, lower your weapons. The comedy is over."

No, no I'm talking about the fucking armistice, is it... Well fuck you too, I'm not the one who told the deputy prosecutor I could shove his...

There, lying nonchalantly under the fence like a true ancap should, a soldier of Waffen $$, riddled with bullets, seemed about ready to depart to a better world. \n - Patch him up - ordered the sergeant, crouching over the wounded. - And now, be so kind and tell me who the hell you are. \n - I am the knight... of the free market - answered the soldier. The fall of eurocommunism is nigh. \n - Eurocommunism? Is that who fucked you up like so? \n - Dunno. I think they wore black. Or red? Or... Dunno. Came from west. Opened fire. My squad fell back. I am a martyr of the.. \n - Aight. Take cover, men. They must be close. \n - Naaah, they.. they fucked off as well, back there - the wounded pointed westward. Everyone is aaall over the fucking place. I have no idea what's going on, we've been going all the way from Jędrzejów or so... \n - Jędrzejów? That means you've broken though Ziobro's... \n - What fucking Ziobro, ain't seen a Ziobrist since... Now it's total chaos. Every man for himself. That's how it'll be... in your fucking ancap... \n\nSoldier fell unconscious. Sandomirians fluttered around, looking around the perimeter. No sound could be heard but the wind, rustling the leaves."

sandomierz.5.t: "A Wave of Nostalgia"
sandomierz.5.desc: "Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz sat at the corner of the bed in his allocated apartment, a minute's walk away from the city hall. It was uncomfortable; painfully so, making any effort to get some actual sleep a nigh impossible challenge. His back was killing him, and his throat had this constant soreness that just refused to go away no matter how he tried to treat it. With the constant stress of the past few months, the politician felt as if he had aged another ten years overnight. Ever since Ziobro's arrival in the voivodeship, he'd been on the run. When the Prosecutor began clearing out all potential opposition within the region, those affiliated with any other party than PiS faced a simple choice - hide out and hope they weren't important enough to pursue or escape the area while they still had the chance. For Sienkiewicz, the only real option was the latter. \n\nAll he had now was a couple of photographs to remind him of the city he was forced to abandon. He clutched one against his chest regretfully. Though it hadn't even been a year of exile, Kielce already seemed like a distant memory. Sandomierz, while welcoming, always felt foreign; the streets unfamiliar, the faces unrecognizable. Other than the few colleagues who fled along with him, Sienkiewicz felt as if he were alone among strangers, joined together only by a single purpose. \n\nEven in this final, forgotten corner of the voivodeship, the Acting Minister couldn't consider himself safe from Ziobro's relentless ambitions. From the start, it was clear that the Prosecutor wouldn't accept anything other than the full eradication of any dissent in the Holy Cross region. Sandomierz's willingness to accept political refugees stood in the face of that mission. When the eventual charge came, the Republic practically resigned itself to its fate, lost in dejected indecision. Backed against the wall, pressed between two PiS-aligned regimes with nowhere else to run, Sienkiewicz vowed to make his final stand rather than passively wait for the inevitable. \n\nForming the basis of a resistance movement didn't prove to be nearly as difficult as expected for the experienced politician. He didn't need any charm nor any special promises. The idea of saving the historic city from the same destruction as his beloved Kielce was more than enough. And when the former mayor fled soon after, Sienkiewicz took charge of the city not by choice but simply because nobody else would. \n\nRemembering these struggles brought an unexpected tear to his eye. It was almost three months ago to the day. Initially, he gave himself a week at most. Somehow, to his own constant surprise, he was still standing. The harsh winter of '26 did much to hold the front in place. Now, as the days were getting longer and the thaw replaced the ice with mud, Sienkiewicz knew a final confrontation was fast approaching. He set the photograph aside. He felt weak, tired, but he promised himself to hide it until Sandomierz was finally secure. Even if, ultimately, it were all to be for nothing."

sandomierz.6.t: "Blissful Ignorance"
sandomierz.6.desc: "On a Saturday just like any other, Grzegorz was driving home in a noticeably joyous mood. The office worker, almost pushing forty, had just finished taking care of the household's weekly groceries, and he was enthusiastic about spending the weekend with his wife and two young sons. Today was Krzysiek's fifth birthday, so he made sure to grab a couple of toys and a very simple board game for the whole family to enjoy together in the evening. After the short trip back from the store, he parked his Mercedes in the driveway, clumsily grabbed the bags from the trunk, making sure to carry everything in one go, and walked inside. \n\nAs his wife began to unpack the bags he had brought in, Grzegorz went to the storage room in search of wrapping paper. Rummaging through decades worth of spare parts and items he swore he would totally find another use for someday proved fruitless, and so; he ended up settling on the next-best replacement to avoid having to take another trip to the soon-closing store. It was a crude and inelegant solution, but using his middling craftsmanship skills, Grzegorz started wrapping the toys using a stack of old, discarded newspapers. \n\nDespite his optimistic expectations, the job proved far harder than expected due to near-constant tears. He managed to somehow wrap the game with an ungodly amount of tape to hold the ripped-out pieces together, but the irregular shape of the toys proved too much to handle. Frustrated, having worked up a bit of a sweat, Grzegorz sat on the room's floor, reading through the bits of history he unsuccessfully tried to repurpose. \n\nJuly 13th, 2025 - Unexplained Nuclear Explosion in Bałuty \n\nApril 30th, 2026 - Proclamation of the Republic of Sandomierz \n\nDecember 24th, 2026 - Declaration of War by the General Prosecutorship \n\nHe squinted his eyes in surprise. The title seemed to make no sense at first. He double-checked. There was no doubt about it; the date matched. The paper was local, so it seemed unlikely to refer to any other place. Frantically, Grzegorz made an effort to reassemble the scattered pieces and restore the page to a legible state. Reading through the article put it beyond any doubt - the Republic was at war. It had been at war for the past 3 months, and nobody seemed to notice. Somewhere out there, people were fighting and dying to defend the country, while here, in Sandomierz, life just went on as usual. Any day, the Prosecutor's troops could seize the city, and he wouldn't even know until it happened. \n\nShocked, Grzegorz went up to alert the family. From now on, they will have to be prepared for any eventuality."
sandomierz.6.a: "There is no war in Sandomierz."

sandomierz.7.t: "Ad-Hoc Propaganda"
sandomierz.7.desc: "In the relatively simple studio of STV, one of Sandomierz's prime local broadcasters, two mildly charismatic presenters were wrapping up their segment of the daily news. Behind them, just outside of the cameras' view, interns working for the Scheduling Director ran back and forth chaotically with old tapes, notes, and just about anything they found that could comply with Acting Minister Sienkiewicz's new guidelines, occasionally breaking through the low-quality audio filters. When, in his clumsiness, one of the new hires tripped over the wiring connecting the broadcast's primary camera with enough force to completely unplug it, the team hurriedly called an unscheduled ad break. The only effect it had was increasing the time pressure. \n\n- Alright, everyone. We're back live in 15. What have you got? - The Scheduling Director was desperately hoping for a sliver of good news. \n- I scoured through the entire archive, boss. We've got roughly around 3 hours of material. \n- For today's programming, right? Please tell me you already fractioned it out, and that's just today's portion. \n- Altogether. 90% of our content covers solely regional events. You know how hard it is to find anything even mentioning Ziobro? Most of my team didn't sleep at all last night looking for any usable clips. Stitching together what we already have has been a nightmare. Half of it doesn't even follow. \n- So that's it? Nothing more. \n- There's always a chance we find something on the second watch. But it won't be much. Probably nothing more than a few background clips. \n- And the other stations? Surely, they're in the same boat. Can't they trade some of their material with us? \n- Uhh... that's the whole problem. Most of them have just as little, so they're being overly protective. It's a bad look when the only footage they're playing has already been covered by everyone else. \n\nHe pondered the situation briefly. There was no way they were getting through the day with just two reports, one exposé, and a series of mashups of unrelated, out-of-context clips. Backed against a corner, he saw only one possible solution. \n\n- Screw it, scrap that whole idea. We're doing our own thing. \n- Huh? How? We have no budget to suddenly start doing investigative journalism in the middle of a war. We don't even have anyone to send out into the field. \n- Marek, who said anything about that? Get the costumes, tell Adam to put on a wig, and give him some typical villain lines to read over and over. He's now our version of the Prosecutor. Just insert him into the background of whatever we're currently playing, and we're golden. \n- Won't the footage look obviously doctored? \n- So what? It's either this or we throw it all out. The viewers can simply ignore him if they want. \n- Mhm? And the cartoons during the kids' segment at 18? \n- I don't know. Slap Ziobro's face on the bad guy or something. Use some editing to teach them the evils of his regime. Get creative. Anything will do. \n- Okay... I think I get it..."

sandomierz.8.t: "Settling a Score"
sandomierz.8.desc: "- So that's the place? Looks kinda... lively. \n- The Boss was clear with his instructions, Michaś. You wanna go and tell him he got the wrong address? \n- Nah, I'm just saying, why the hell would Młynarz conduct his business here, of all places? \n- That's why they don't pay you to think. The point is: who in their right mind would suspect there's anything nefarious going on two streets down from the town square? \n- Uh-huh... let's just get this over with. We're already drawing in far too much attention. \n\nAfter putting on their balaclavas, the two jumped out of their van, inconspicuously repainted to resemble a maintenance truck. They burst through the reinforced doors of the building marked as the target of their raid, blindly swinging their bats to take out any potential defenders. With their uncoordinated aggression eventually subsiding, the gangsters looked around, surrounded by broken glass, cracked flowerpots, and mounds of dirt scattered on the concrete floor. An alarm blared deafeningly as they searched in rising confusion for any possible loot. \n\n- Damn it, they've duped us! There's nothing here. \n- Once the Boss finds out about this, we're screwed. \n- It's not our fault he gave us the wrong address. Now, let's get out of here. We'll be in far more trouble if the cops catch us. We'll explain it to him later. \n- Are you out of your mind? There are too many stragglers outside. We can't get out without leaving witnesses. \n- What would you rather do, huh? Hide out here and hope everyone just forgets this break-in ever happened? \n- Well, yeah... \n- No, you idiot. It's only going to get worse. Either we make a getaway or face 5 to 10. Cmon. \n\nAfter a brief deliberation, the pair decided to quickly leave the trashed store before anyone could intervene. Unfortunately for them, the noise had already attracted a small crowd. \n\n- Uhh, you didn't see nothin'. Any one of you snitches, you'll be dealing with Bielak. Got it? \n- Fuck's sake, Michaś. Stop messing about. They saw us, yeah? You know what to do. \n\nDoing what they do best, the mobsters grabbed their bats and whacked the unlucky observers into unconsciousness. Leaving the victims to their fates, they jumped back in their truck without a second thought, wondering only how exactly they were going to spin this failure to their Boss. The last thing they saw was a dark figure, barely visible in the dim glow of the streetlights, making its way to the crime scene."

sandomierz.9.t: "Crashing the Party"
sandomierz.9.desc: "It was his moment of triumph. All around the Old Town Square, thousands cheered, going out of their way to arrive in droves on a particularly windy Friday evening and thank their saviors for achieving what seemed hardly imaginable back when the conflict started at the end of '26 - successfully protecting Sandomierz from the Prosecutor's onslaught. He was at the center of it all, and although Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz hardly felt like a hero, mostly having managed domestic affairs while the militias fought tooth-and-nail to halt Ziobro's advance in the mud-covered fields west of Opatów, he was still more than keen to bask in their gratitude for the colossal effort he made to defend a city he hardly knew. \n\nAfter a brief, improvised parade that ended up showcasing the victorious units' lack of both organization and equipment rather than any actual military might, Sienkiewicz was welcomed on stage by a series of particularly enthusiastic hypemen, attributing the origin of the victory to his personal grit and sacrifice. While the statements may have been partially true, he nonetheless felt slightly uncomfortable taking all the credit. For his speech, he had a simple plan - recognize everyone's contributions, praise the militias, and pass the triumphal baton on to the next speaker. Nothing particularly controversial. He stepped up to the microphone. The atmosphere remained jubilant, but he could tell the crowd wasn't really there for him. \n\n- My dear citizens! - Sienkiewicz began with a veteran politician's practiced diction. - It brings me immense joy that you've come here in such numbers. I'm proud of you all. Proud of what you've managed to achieve. Of your grit, of your resoluteness to fight and beat overwhelming odds. When I first came to this city barely over a year ago, I never could have expected... \n\nHe paused. There was some commotion in the back of the crowd. He watched as one section after another fell into complete disorder, dispersing in panic through every street leading out of the square. He stood there, unsure what to do, trying futilely to calm the people down until a police sergeant ran up to him, visibly out of breath. \n\n- Acting Minister, there has been an attack on Długosza Street. Seven wounded. Two unresponsive. \n- Damn it, now? Did it really have to happen now of all times? \n- Seems like a gang affair, sir. Long planned. They must've used the celebrations as a cover but something went terribly wrong and a few civilians ended up in the mix. \n- Great. There goes any semblance of order. You'll have to answer for this oversight, segreant. So get to work. Any suspects so far? \n- Just one. We found him lingering around the crime scene. Dressed all in black, alibi makes absolutely no sense... \n- Alright, bring him in for questioning. \n- Yeah, about that..."
sandomierz.9.a: "....he's already fled the area."

sandomierz.10.t: "Protect and Serve"
sandomierz.10.desc: "The day was coming to an end as Patrol Officer Limanowski sat hunched over his desk, knee-deep in paperwork. It was already dark outside, but by his estimates, he was roughly around half-way into processing today's incoming reports. Every other hour, he made sure to throw the files he put in the system into the overstuffed box of outstanding cases but the stacks of papers to both his left and right continued to look like a major falling hazard. Since the start of the week, he's been grounded in the precinct's station, unsuccessfully fighting to keep up with the unending tide of crime paralyzing the city. Not that he'd complain, of course. The place was surprisingly cozy, much more so than the lawless streets of Sandomierz. After all, why would he risk his safety out there when he could rake in the same meager salary without having to step more than 20 meters away from his desk? As long as he made himself look busy, his biggest worry was potentially misplacing some of the documents that occasionally collapsed onto the floor. \n\n- Limanowski! Good news; you get to take a break from the paperwork. We need you on the streets. - The sergeant's voice was stern and authoritative, despite his clear exhaustion from overwork. It left little room for discussion. \n- Uhh, but sir, what about these new cases? I still have to input them into the system. - He said, hoping to convince his superior to let him stay. \n- Oh screw the new cases. We're badly overstretched and need everybody in the field. Even you. So grab your gear and go. I don't want to see you in here the next time I do the rounds. \n\nDisappointed, Limanowski grabbed the first report he had yet to file. Mechanic, gone missing after an argument with a loan shark and his thugs. The officer quickly put the document back into the middle of the pile. He didn't even receive his gun due to the recent budget cuts. He wasn't nearly crazy enough to try arresting a group of thugs unarmed. He reached for the next file - a series of robberies linked to a local gang establishing its territory in Rokitek. Similarly, he threw it to the side. One by one, he dug through the reports, dismissing anything that looked above his pay grade. Eventually, the officer stopped, having found the perfect problem to resolve with his investigative skills: \n\n9-year-old Zuzia K. is looking for her missing cat, last seen two days ago on the front porch of her house. She responds to the name 'Łapka'. The reward for the finder is set at 100zł. \n\nSeeing the poor girl's plight, Patrol Officer Limanowski sprang into action. The people called for help and he answered. It was time to deliver some justice."
sandomierz.10.a: "He was unable to find the cat. Łapka returned home a day later, unharmed."

sandomierz.11.t: "Enemy of the Republic"
sandomierz.11.desc: "Sitting in his comfortable office chair, Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz impatiently tapped his fingers against the slightly worn, stylish dark oak desk while repeatedly throwing a side glance at the wall-mounted clock in the corner of the room. It was 12:13, meaning the man he was supposed to meet was now 13 minutes late to their time-sensitive appointment. He made a mental note of this fact as he began annoyedly considering the officer's future replacement to take his mind away from the protests happening outside. The politician took two more sips of his lukewarm black coffee before a series of knocks signaled his guest's belated arrival. Police Chief Górecki entered without any sense of urgency, maintaining a dignified posture as he handed his superior a packet of disorganized documents. \n\n- Here's the file you requested, sir. We weren't able to find much, though. Guy's an enigma. \n- You're late, officer. Whatever's inside it better be worth the wait. \n- Our resources are stretched pretty thin trying to maintain order. We don't really have much left to spare to look into side projects. - The Police Chief's insubordination was plain to see. Whatever respect he normally held for the Acting Minister was temporarily put on hold as a result of plentiful fruitless searches he had to personally oversee. \n- This 'side project' is currently the main threat to any semblance of stability within the city. I expect you to regard it with the appropriate seriousness. \n- Him? Not the gangs or the hundreds of angry citizens just outside your office? \n- Yes. He's a parallel authority, Górecki. You'd know if you occasionally bothered to leave the comfort of your station to do some actual police work. - At this point, Sienkiewicz was more than displeased with the officer's subpar job performance, given how things have only ever gotten worse under his watch. - As long as he's around, he remains a figure the opposition can rally behind. \n- Uh-huh, and what is it that you expect us to do about him, Acting Minister? We tried tailing him whenever possible. As far as we know, he isn't up to anything shady. If anything, it seems like he's actually trying to help people. \n- Then you just aren't looking hard enough. - He skimmed through the documents for a third time, noting the lack of any concrete, damning information on the dozen-or-so pages. - Life's not a fairy tale. People don't do things out of the goodness of their hearts. He must have some ulterior motives, and it's your job to find them. If not, at least make it look like he's plotting something nefarious. For the sake of the Republic, we need to get him off the streets as soon as possible. Now get work. Make sure to leave the door half-open as you go."

sandomierz.13.desc: "Following yet another arduous day of work, Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz was finally ready to head off to sleep. The past weeks had been draining, and though he had gotten used to the usual clamor of protests, disturbing what little rest he managed to eke out, he could tell that at this point, he was practically running on fumes. Exhausted, Sienkiewicz turned off his bedside lamp and closed his eyes, pondering the next day's packed daily schedule. As his thoughts drifted, he could swear that a familiar melody was playing repeatedly in his head, slowly getting closer, bothering his peace. Irritated, he turned the light back on, freezing in shock at the sight of the figure before him. \n\n- Bartłomiej, we need to talk. - The man standing over the foot of the bed spoke in a tone so calming and reassuring; it emanated authority far beyond that of his supposed status. \n- You! What are you doing here? H-how? I personally made sure you're behind bars... - the politician spoke frantically. \n- You did, and I forgive you for it. But that is not why I am here. \n- W-why then? \n- You cheated, Bartłomiej. You were never supposed to reach this point. \n- Cheated? What do you mean? Seriously, what is going on? - The panic was beginning to set in his voice as the priest's accusations continued. \n- You fiddled with the console. Seen things you were never meant to see. It's quite impressive, in a way, yet you cannot defy the fate you've been given. \n- So, what exactly would that fate be, then? - Sienkiewicz spoke in resignation. \n- If all had played out as intended, you would not have retained your current position. That is all I am allowed to tell you. Do not worry. Your mistakes will be corrected. \n- Look, you can't do this. - He pleaded dramatically. - I... I've just started turning this place around. I know it's not perfect, but it's finally stabilizing. I put in so much effort, I led this city through war, I even... \n- And yet, you cheated. I'm sorry, but it has to be this way. This episode has already gone on for far too long. We will meet again soon, under very different circumstances. \n\nAs the figure continued to stand above him, the melody returned, louder than before. Overpowering Sienkiewicz's thoughts, a lengthy list of names flashed in front of his eyes until, as the final note triumphally finished playing, all went still as the timer reached its last second."

Sienkiewicz found this relieving; someone has been thoughtful and analysed the situation before the shit hit the rocks, and this he considered to be the sign of highest competence a mere subordinate person could exhibit. However, it all seemingly went off rails a few minutes in. \n - Look, all I'm saying there are two alternatives. We can descend into the subterranean network of corridors and cellars under the old town, of which we have exclusive knowledge due to our control of the municipal archives, and escape through a place they will dare not - \n - Or? \n - What? \n - Or the alternative - Sienkiewicz said with a wearisome voice - I am not going to walk through some dreary underground tourist attraction. This idea is, honestly, sketchy as fuck. Naive. Primitive, even. Only an moron could think of something like that. Or my great-grandfather. Or a nerd. Or... \n - Or we can be driven out of the city on wheelbarrows. \n - This is not an alternative. \n - There was no alternative from the start, for God's sake! We have to run! Now! \n\nConveniently, some rumbling could be heard outside. Now Sienkiewicz has realised he should be briefed by the police a good while ago, and since he hasn't been briefed by anyone except this dungeon moron, he begun to get nervous. \n - Can you call the chief of... \n - I tried for the last hour and got no response - said the intern, raising his hand immediately to pause Sienkiewicz. - I was going to get onto that, just that I wanted to raise the most important question first, that is... \n\nSome glass was broken, judging from the clear sound - inside the bulding. Sienkiewicz sighed and rised from his chair. \n - Do they actually have wheelbarrows? \n - Yyes. Nice and large. \n - Anything else? Pitchforks? Axes? Baseball bats? \n - I don't think so. Had they been so agressive to take them, they'd be here a long time ago. It seems Mateusz has raised them well in this one aspect. \n - Alright then - Sienkiewicz buttoned his jacket. - Wheelbarrow it is. At least leaving the town will be easier. It was a nightmare to drive here."

Now, he was making his first steps in administering the state from the mayor's armchair in the Town Hall. He tried to comfort himself, that it was just a relocation from one Dominican tabernacle to another. As it were, convincing oneself is more difficult than convincing the whole city.\n\nIt was never his intention to rise so high. Impersonating a priest from a cult TV show wasn't his first choice either. Artur Żmijewski just wanted to help people, despite the fact he had little in common with Sandomierz. Had he had his way, he would organize humanitarian campaigns and voice his opinions as a well-known, but ultimately quite plain actor. However, Sienkiewicz's spiders would quickly silence him, just as many other potential dissidents would before him. In order to be left in peace, he needed to be on a higher plane of fame and ideally receive sacral blessings. Not to sate his ego. It was necessary for survival. With bishop's Nitkiewicz approval, Artur Żmijewski faded into obscurity and Father Mateusz Żmigrodzki started giving sermons about the monstrosity of war, banditry and eventually against the corruption of the government. When the disgruntled population finally overthrew the tyranny of Sienkiewicz, they chose him - the only one to speak loudly about what everyone thought and practically carried him to the City Hall. He hadn't managed to fully grasp the intricacies of real priesthood and then the citizens bestowed upon him the mission of becoming the statesman or at least playing him. The people of Sandomierz believed in him and he had to carry the burden of their dreams and give them the best performance of his life!"

Besides, it's not like we'd missing something substantial - Sławek complained.\nIt wasn't in his style to rely on others. In his perfect world, he would be able to afford to buy enough food for himself and his family.\n- Oh, don't give me that. I remember how you gorged yourself with the state-issued broth yesterday - Grzegorz tried to cut the discussion short - Stop being a cunt and just come with me.\n\nOnce they arrived the line was already enormous. Many Sandomierzans hid pride in their pockets due to the high food prices.\n- See? - Grzegorz reignited their discussion during the arduous wait. - No matter what the quality, it's quantity that matters. And the fact the government really cares about the little man.\n- That's no way to provide for the people. Had this 'Mateusz' really cared for us, he'd think perspectively and set up some proper industry so people could earn decent wages. Then those soup kitchens wouldn't be necessary. - Sławek retorted\n- Yeah so why won't you leave the line? - Grzegorz started regretting carrying on a conversation with his complaining friend - the fact he offers the alms to the poor shows he's the real deal and not an actor like those cooks would have you believe.\n- Trust me, if the Apostles spent their money more wisely, I wouldn't be so desperate. - Sławek defended himself - They forced my hand.\n- Yeah, alright. - Grzegorz was done with Sławek's tyrades - Be quiet now. We're getting closer to the kettles. One more word and they'll refuse to serve you.\nNatalia Borowik herself was serving needing the soup. Grzegorz humbly thanked me for the meal. Sławek decided to make one last joke at the expense of the establishment.\n- Mrs. Natalia! With your surname I'd have expected a mushroom soup!\nThe housekeeper gave him a long look, before handing him his portion without a word.\nIn the end, Sławek swallowed his pride and a spoonful of soup to make.

What's more, it was clear those Apostles knew nothing about the industry and management, allowing Guzik to bullshit them however he liked. Or so the industrial planist thought.\n-Excuse me, sir. - The negotiator sent by the Father wanted to express his doubts... again.\nThe lack of expertise didn't stop Mateusz's acolytes from talking Guzik's ear off.\n- I just thought - the acolyte continued - Is it really necessary to build the works in Kamień? We already have something of an industrial district in Zarzekowice.\n-Mhm. Zarzekowice - the planner had to put up with this nonsense for just a little longer - the district named after the fact it's placed *beyond* the river. Right at your enemies' doorstep. I didn't think you were that committed to charity, you'd handle industry to the neighboring warlord.\n- I just thought... - the Sandomierz's representative said shakily - Completing the project where you intended would displace many families.\nTough luck. I thought helping those in need was your specialty. What's a few more?\n- You surely don't mean...\n- Yes, I do - Guzik interrupted - It's a standard procedure. A single hut can't stop a highway construction. And then the recompensation follows. Simple as that. Now, if there's nothing else, I'd like to return to finishing the planing.\nThankfully for Guzik the acolyte left.\n-Finally, he's gone - the planner thought to himself. - At least until he asks them about the place where the waste would be disposed. Why do they think I wanted the plant so close to the river? They should be glad, we'll mainly pollute the water beyond the city's borders.\nNow that he was alone he was able to finish the job of cataloging all of the households and the day's work done.

The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about his TV show is crime-fighting. Even, if he relies heavily on the police, he won't be able to avoid direct engagement.\nHis ponderings were stopped by the call to the door.\nHe personally stood up to open the door. After all Kinga Preis wouldn't open the door for him, despite acting as his housekeeper. Method acting appernetly wasn't for her.\n- God bless you, Father. - A woman, whose accent indicated Ukrainian heritage greeted Mateusz sorrowfully - I would like to organize a funeral for my husband.\n- Certainly - Mateusz hid his uneasiness by covering his mouth in a compassionate gesture - Please continue.\n- The police said it was a suicide, but it can't be true. He was a good Christian, my Oleksandr. Or were. He'd never do that. He wouldn't take his life. He wouldn't leave me. He wouldn't cast away the God's gift.\nShe couldn't continue.\n- I will soon try to organize the ceremony. Let us talk tomorrow about the details, shall we? - Although someone else would deal with the organization given his inexperience.\nShe nodded\n- God be with you. - Mateusz bid her farewell.\nFuneral or not she was right something wasn't right. Her devotion was sincere and if she couldn't believe her husband took his own life, the truth could've been concealed from the police.\nSomeone should take care of that, and that someone was Father Matthew.\n- Looks like I'll soon work on my first case.\nAll things considered he was lucky as morbid as that may sound in the context. Before, dealing with more serious crimes, like murders and robberies he'd welcome a case that's. Although tragic, it seems less dangerous for him. He'll have to risk his life eventually, but he hopes that day would come later, than sooner. He'll ask the officers whether they know anything about this Oleksandr. He'll start by checking his workplace.\nFinding new purpose for the time being, Mateusz decides to waste no more time, jumps on his bike, and decides to take matters into his own hands immediately."

sandomierz.18.desc: "The negotiations with Colonel Grzegorz Kobylarz were surprisingly easy. But when push came to shove it was clear he much preferred working in the field to dealing with the bureaucracy as a minister. The Polish officers in general were well used to having more or less competent civilian officers so the soldier accepted Mateusz's proposal to be replaced with Junior Inspector Orest Możejko AKA Piotr Polk in the position of minster. Paradoxically, Mateusz expected more problems when dealing with the head of the local police. As always he was right.\n\n-You want me to step down as the district commissioner, sirs... Erm, sir, and Father? - Deputy Inspector Grzegorz Jaworski was terrified by Mateusz's proposal .\nOffical control over the ministry was one thing, but for the fully believable act, Orest Możejko from the show had to assume direct control over the local police force. Żmijewski and Polk looked into each other's eyes expecting the worst.\n- I understand a Deputy Inspector is my senior - Jaworski continued to list his doubts - However, I haven't been able to find the files regarding your experience, sir. Either in Sandomierz or anywhere else.\n- Well - 'Możejko' tried to defend himself - The dossier must have burned during the Fall.\n- Understandable - Deputy Inspector replied. - What was your specialization?\n- Criminal Department - Polk replied just like Mateusz told him to when they rehearsed.\n- CID, I expected as much. What I meant was which subdepartment was your favorite? Stickup squad? B&E? Maybe SVU?\n- Erm... - Polk was at a loss.\n- Why don't you show, Deputy Inspector, what you've already done? - Mateusz interceded to save his colleague - Just to ease his worries.\nIf anything this information stressed Jaworski even more.\n- Oh, right! - Możejko remembered about the plan B - I didn't want to change things before you fill me in about local specifics. I just wanted to check how well the local police force knows the drill. Follow me.\nAll three of them reached a courtyard and saw 3 squads in dress uniforms coupled with the representative police orchestra. The drill took a few minutes and ended with a gun salute. All with the musical accompaniment.\n- Well, the drill was nothing special, they could've put more effort into that - Jaworski gave his opinion. Two actors expected the failure - But the orchestra gave the performance of their lives! No false notes, the right rhythm, and all. Truth be told I was a little overprotective about my little post, but you seem to know what you've been doing. I don't remember any commissioner being able to make those guys listenable.\nJaworski saluted.\n- It's an honor to have you with us, sir. I should've believed Mateusz wouldn't let the police crumble.\nMateusz and Możejko made a sigh of relief once Jaworksi left. Trying to capitalize on Polk's musical education was their best shot and, against all odds, it worked.\n- So far, so good - Mateusz tried to remain optimistic."

It means a great deal to me and the people of Sandomierz.\n-It was a matter of necessity - bishop Nitkiewicz countered his cajoling with a much harsher tone. Years of dealing with the Polish Ecumenical Council taught him how to negotiate and debate without subduing oneself and one's beliefs to the other side. - We needed someone to oust the corrupt, godless Sienkiewicz without our direct interference.\n- We of course greatly appreciate your dedication to elevating the poor and combating crime - contrary to bishop Nitkiewicz, who specialized in canonical law, bishop Frankowski was much more concerned about the Catholic social teaching regarding social labor, henceforth he was much more accommodating to the imposter.\n- But answer us that, Mr. Żmijewski - Nitkiewicz continued - Why should we trade an antitheist for a sacrilegist?\n- Your excellencies - Mateusz began - I never meant to shame God, the Church, or the faithful. I myself am a practicing Catholic. This role was not my own choice. It was put on my shoulders by the outside force. The people needed someone to believe in and I realized I could do much more good with the beloved persona. Dare I say, it might have been a sign from God.\n- If that had been so, the Lord would've instructed you to become a real priest - Nitkiewicz stopped Żmijewski's apologia - Or is that why you are here?\n- Not exactly. I am not ready for the priestly orders. However, I would humbly ask you to allow me to give a sermon during the next Mass.\nThe priest was bewildered by his audacity.\n- Again - Żmijewski defended himself - Not because of my hubris, but because it's expected of me. This is a will of the people that sanctions my mission. As blessed Alcuin said: Vox populi, vox Dei.\n- The bishops were left with quite a conundrum.\nIt was true that the deeds of Mateusz were widely popular among the people and it worked for the benefit of the Holy Church. The Masses hadn't been attended by so many people for some time. And the faithful had been sending letters asking about the timetables of Father Mateusz's sermons for some time. And because they didn't condemn Mateusz's activities when they started they were already trapped in Żmijewski's web of lies.\nFrankowski looked at Nitkiewicz. He didn't need to say anything, they already had discussed the Żmigrodzki Question by themselves and had quite several alternative plans for different scenarios, and the bishop of Sandomierz knew his auxiliary's worldview.\nNitkiewicz nodded at him.\n- We are ready to allow you to give a sermon to the faithful. What guides us to make that exception is the greater good of the Church and your seemingly noble intentions - Frankowski said encouraged by his superior's approval.\n- Know however that this is merely a temporary measure - Nitkiewicz wanted to have the last word - In the future we expect you to undergo the process of taking holy orders if you want to continue your unofficial ministration.\nŻmijewski's eyes widened.\n- But, Father. I have a wife.\n- You don't have to worry about your marriage - Nitkiewicz continued - It is possible to ask for the papal dispense in exceptional cases to allow married men to become priests. And your case is clearly exceptional.\n- It's not us blackmailing you - Frankowski tried to soften the message. Maybe it was the right thing to do. Żmijewski seemed like a good person and that demand visibly shook him - It's just that, as your popularity grows, more and more clergymen may start to ask questions. Clergymen that are of higher rank than us and may not be as eager to cooperate as us.\n- Understandable - Żmijewski answered - Thank you, your Excellencies for your help. I won't fail you.\n- What are we doing, Edward? - Nitkiewicz asked once Father Mateusz left.\n- We're doing what's best for the Church and its faithful. Be patient, friend. Soon the semi-blasphemous exceptions will end once the Holy See sanctions Żmijewski as our brother."

The only independent regional TV that isn't afraid to tell the Truth unshackled by the system and censorship. Last time, we discussed the evidence that proved that there was no explosion at Bałuty and the district is intact and completely habitable.\nToday I'd like to talk about something closer to home. The identity of the so-called Father Mateusz. The editorial staff discussed the matter and all two of us came to the conclusion that the self-proclaimed Apostle of Christ is no other than an actor - Artur Żmijewski. First of all, their names: Żmijewski and Żmigrodzki sound like a lazy deception. It's a joke at the expense of us all. If we go deeper into the Church archives, we'll realize no Mateusz Żmijewski has ever been consecrated nor has he been present in Sandomierz. The same can be said about his cronies pretending to be policemen - no mention of them in the police database. Has anyone ever seen any of them before the Fall? If you still aren't convinced, let me present you the pre-Fall photo of Artur Żmijewski and a photo of Mateusz Żmigrodzki from yesterday's local newspaper. They're clearly the same person. Do you believe that every role he's ever played is real? Then let me show you something. I'd like to apologise in advance those of  faint hearts among us. Here I present a film still from 'Psy', where we can see Radosław Wolf played by Żmijewski holding two cut-off heads. Is that your, Father as well? Or just another of his roles?\nNow, why would anyone stage such a farse? My theory is that it is a plot of Sienkiewicz's return to power. Oh sure, right now 'Mateusz' declares his willingness to help people, because he's a good person. But good people don't lie, so likely he will soon try to sabotage his own country to take away people's hope. Then Sienkiewicz will return to save Sandomierz and rule people deceived into thinking there's no alternative to his rule.\nWhat do you think? Let's check the comments!

All we're planning to do they still slander us!\n- It's an opinion they have a right to. And it's quite nuanced actually.\n- Oh, that ambiguity is just for the beginning to attract both sides. After that, the agenda will kick in.\nDespite the advice from Mateusz, Kinga 'Natalia Borowik' Preis kept on listening to numerous news. 'You've put me into this now, I have to know they're talking about us'\n- You think they do this on their own? - Natalia continued her ramble - Obviously, it's what remains of Sienkiewicz's influence! Something must be done about this!\n- Like what? Put them in jail? - Mateusz asked calmly - Sienkiewicz's gone. Maybe that's just people's honest opinion. Maybe we should just try harder to show them the truth of our intentions.\n- How naive. No wonder you got picked for the role in the first place. - Natalia couldn't deny herself a snarky response - I think you should set things straight.\nMateusz looked at her curiously. He could guess the answer but didn't want to interrupt Natalia rudely.\n- You've got the same possibilities Sienkiewicz used to put all this rubbish in people's heads. You can use it for good. Have a whole thing defending you against baseless accusations.\n- Kinga. We have to prove, we're not like the previous regime. We have to do something with that media conglomerate, but parceling it and selling it to smaller newspaper agencies and TV stations would be a true sign of our noble intentions.\n- You know I'm not saying, we should do exactly as Sienkiewicz. - Natalia calmed Żmijewski - It's just a temporary measure. Removing the false information from aether before giving space to kooks and liars.\n - I'm not convinced.\n- That's why you're the right person for this type of action. You'll know when the measures are no longer necessary than dismantling this machine. What's the alternative?

Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\nThe Word of the Lord\n- Praise be to Thee, Christ. - The faithful, more numerous than ever in the Church of Saint James, answered.\n- Today we are visited by a special guest. - Father Dominik Krysztof announced - We were often asked when he would give a sermon of his own. The man needed no further introduction. Father Matthew approached a pulpit. Nervous as ever. Trying to convince himself it's just another theatre play.\n- Brothers and sisters, we live in a time of great turmoil surrounded by many enemies, we burn with fire of revenge. Yet we have to remember that Christ the Lord told us not to demand an eye for an eye, but to turn the other cheek. Remember that loving your neighbor as yourself is the second Greatest Commandment, preceded only by the Commandment to love God with all your heart. Wise are those, that follow the path of mercy and charity. That is my message to those, who struggle with loving their enemies.\nTo those, who do help their enemies as well as their friends, I urge you not to fall under the weight of pride. The charity must not be done out of the need for recognition or gaining popularity. We cannot treat each other as a means to an end. Help in secret, purely out of the kindness in your heart.\nIn the Middle Ages chroniclers and authors erased their names from history. The Popes for centuries have been concealing their names under the venerable patrons. Even the authors of the Gospels are unknown to us. The authors of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John probably weren't the Apostles themselves, but their students sought to honor their teachings. All for the greater glory of God and the idea they wanted to spread. One could say they wore masks. Heed another lesson. Don't judge the men for their outward appearances. Sometimes things are not as they seem. Only God and themselves know the truth. Those craving fame may indeed be truly humble. Those who seem to put themselves at the forefront may have actually sacrificed their own identity. Do not judge, or you too will be judged.\nMateusz paused unsure what to do next. He looked to an acolyte. The boy raised his hand in a helping gesture.\n- I think it's the right time to rise and confess our faith."

sandomierz.23.desc: "It's been a difficult time for Sandomierz's custodian. The constant illusion, the pressure of maintaining a second identity to reassure the masses... it all proved just as tiring as it had been on day one. He'd been playing a character for so long that he missed being able to just be himself. And so, on the seventh day, Father Mateusz rested. With relief, he took off the well-worn black cassock and put on his usual civilian clothing. Not really the perfect disguise, but he decided it would have to do. The target of his journey - the slightly elevated 'Pepper Mountains' with a good vantage point overlooking the city, weren't necessarily the most frequented of areas, making it reasonably easy to avoid detection. With that plan in mind, Artur set out from the back entrance of the presbytery, continuing the trip on his trusted, old bike - also mostly a prop. \n\nThe ride had been surprisingly peaceful, and despite being disappointingly out of training, Artur was able to reach the 'summit' in around 20 minutes. For the first time in a long while, he felt no sense of unsafety when crossing some of the shadier, eastern parts of the city, nor the need to dodge any particularly angered crowds. It was almost cathartic, and so, sitting on the warm, comforting hilltops of the Pepper Mountains, the actor finally felt at peace, basking in the midday sun. \n\n- Quite a nice weather today, eh? - A woman's voice, roughly middle-aged, sounded behind him. He turned. \n- Huh? Oh... umm, definitely. Perfect for such an excursion. - Artur answered, startled at the sudden company. \n- True. I don't come here often, but today... hold on, I think I recognize you from somewhere. You're that actor... uhh... Żmijewski, right? \n- That's right. You know, as weird as it sounds, I really didn't expect to be recognized, at least not today. \n- Oh please, you've probably done more for Sandomierz than most of the folks in charge. You're practically our local hero. So much so that we've now even got a copycat running around. He claims to actually be the real Father Mateusz, somehow. \n- And do you believe him? \n- Maybe. Maybe not. Strangers things have happened lately, you know. He's been doing a good job so far; that's all I really care about. I'm not going to go out of my way to prove whether or not he's a fraud. \n- So... you don't mind not knowing? \n- Not necessarily. But you; you should definitely meet him. Just imagine the scenes - the actor and the character in the same room. \n- Uhh... that would certainly be something. I'll... make sure to add that to my schedule."

Even if you do not wish to play, as long as you continue to sit at the table, your opponent will play his move no matter what. \n\nThe board was set. Father Mateusz waited, patient in the face of the incoming threat. He refused to move his pieces unprompted. His moral obligations wouldn't let him play the role of the aggressor. In this way, the black suited him - here as in life. But even a dedicated proponent of peace must, at times, defend himself and those who cannot do so on their own. \n\nHis opponent continued his development. The attack was somewhat disorganized and hasty, but it still looked much more effective than whatever the priest was doing, as, despite the mounting pressure, Father Mateusz seemed content to repeatedly shuffle his knights back and forth. He was rapidly losing ground, squeezed onto his own half of the board. And then, once the enemy had been sufficiently drawn in... \n\nIn just a few moves, it was over. After a series of simple mistakes, the priest managed to capture three pieces without any reply. Then, just as the momentum swung in his favor, he gently retreated his knights to their starting positions, almost as if they had never been moved at all. There was no bloodlust to his actions, no need to press for victory whatever the cost. For Father Mateusz, conflict was nothing more than a grim necessity, and he refused to cause any more suffering than the bare minimum. \n\nHe proceeded with utmost care, avoiding any needless exchanges even if doing so put him at a potential disadvantage. The game dragged, painfully so, as the priest slowly secured his position. An hour passed, then another, until... \n\n- Bishop to C2. I believe that's checkmate. Good game, Orest. \n- Yeah, I almost had you there, you know. One day, that opening's going to backfire. \n\nSuch is the nature of the Sandomierz Gambit - to win through sheer passiveness, like an immovable rock holding back against the waves crashing into it with full force. In war - to let the enemy force unravel before you, to minimize the damage its winds inadvertently bring. If Poland cannot be put back together through peace, he will do everything in his power so that the embers of conflict leave as few of its victims lying lifeless on the nation's soil."

You REALLY didn't expect the consequences? \n- Look, I'm sorry, alright. Just... pick out the largest church there or something, and we can improvise. \n- Uh-huh. Easier said than done. There's pretty much nothing there except old STAR factories. Good luck explaining to everyone that we're crossing the border only to see a couple of temples smaller than the ones we have back home. Maybe some altars, too, if we find any on the way. \n- Hold on, let me see. Surely there has to be something... \n\nWith painful slowness, Paweł dragged the cursor across the map, zooming in on every unremarkable village along its path. Dziurów... nothing. Rzepin... nothing. The process frustrated even the most patient of the attendees. Jabłonna... nothing. Kałków... wait... is that... \n\nThe group stared in disbelief at the slightly pixelated image before them. A three-story tall structure shaped like a Ziggurat, with a large cross atop it and uneven rows of shields plastered on the walls, stood opposite a low-quality replica of the plane that crashed in Smolensk back in 2010, with a picture of the president, who died in the event, peeking out the fake window. Just to the side - engraved scenes depicting the original way of the cross, the entire chaotic picture captioned with the title 'The Polish Golgotha.' \n\n- Please tell me you're not actually thinking about this. \n- Give me a better alternative, Marcin. You know you can't. You said it yourself - there is nothing to see in Starachowice. Now that - you can't tell me this place isn't memorable. \n- If anything, it's too memorable. This was supposed to be a spiritual journey, not some village carnival. \n- No, Marcin. This is, first and foremost, a political play. And if visiting this parody of our faith makes those commies up north more inclined to let us in, I'll be damned - we are going to the Smolensk Ziggurat, and we will sing its praises the whole way through. Tell the chaplain - we are making a detour."

No matter how many steps they took, the constant hymns and the general atmosphere of worship seemed to carry them forward. The border was just ahead, and though a small garrison from Starachowice guarded the loosely defended line, the pilgrims were determined to press on to their destination and only make camp once they reached the other side. A soldier clung to his rifle as the gathering approached, unsure as to what the exact orders demanded. He knew what the consequences of either decision would be. After a brief call, his superior emerged from the guardpost. The pilgrims are to be let through with an appropriate escort and then returned back across the border afterward."

sandomierz.26.t: "Chasing the Serpent from Eden Event"
sandomierz.26.desc: "As any leader worth his salt, Kelthuz vanished long before any of his enemies could see him. This, naturally, made things harder for his men in the short term, but - potentially - much more prospective in the long one. Nothing in Poland felt really stable and Sandomierz rule was no exception. \n\nNot really convinced that sending off spies to neighbouring warlords would be of any use, Sandomirian officials focused on the domestic search. A large number of posters were printed and hung even in the lowliest villages. Unfortunately, most of the people did not see Kelthuz personally. Local folk, being only vaguely aware that denouncing a certain long-haired man could bring them fortune, reported a metric shitton of Waffen-$$ former combatants hiding around, who still carefully emulated the look of their leader. This proved useful in its own right, but did not bring the authorities one step closer to finding their target. \n\nFinally, a breakthrough came. Among the uncertainty, someone came up with a story that Kelthuz is hiding in the mountains, as a true folk hero, akin to robbers and highwaymen of yore, helping the needy and fighting clerical invaders. Whoever made this up (no one of Sandomirians wanted to take credit), did a great job in striking the right note. Almost all of Kelthuz's veterans stepped up and claimed that this is bullshit and the chief would never fall as low as to deal with some low-level distributary charity. This denial, with no trace of the former leader to be found, helped a ton in downplaying the problem of Kelthuz whereabouts. True, once in a while people reported stolen hens or other minor stuff, and rumours kept their strength. However, as week after week went by, these incidents grew more into a sort of meme then actual belief. No one really believed an occasional crime here and there was actually the work of the Man of the Land of Iron..."

sandomierz.28.desc: "What always seemed unlikely from the start has reached its inevitable conclusion. While the alliance between Sandomierz and Starachowice may have proven useful in fending off the various warlords of the Holy Cross region, the vast ideological differences between the two have led to a complete dissolution of their partnership. Former brothers-in-arms now gaze at each other in distrust, unsure of who will be the first to pull the trigger as the path to a peaceful reunification has been irrevocably crossed off, leaving war as the only alternative. The voivodeship is bound to soon be unified, but the only uncertainty remaining is whether tens or thousands have to die for its unity."

sandomierz.33.t: "The Sane Summit"
sandomierz.33.desc: "The meeting was scheduled in a quiet room, with windows to the woods. Materek ordered the desk to be removed and left only two comfortable chairs, together with a tiny table with tea, coffee and a platter of cookies. No one has touched the cross hanging over the door for a long time, which posed a tiny dilemma whether it should be dusted (which could suggest it was only hung for the occasion) or left as it was (which could suggest it did not get due respect). As Materek considered the options, the arrival of his guest caught him off-guard. Without any announcement but a few gentle knocks, Mateusz entered the room, alone, and shook hands with the host. \n\n - Praised be Jesus Christ. Please take a seat, father. \nMateusz sat in a chair, folding his hands. \n - Should we start with a prayer, father? - asked Materek, somewhat bewildered at this oniric vision of a TV star sitting in front of him to talk about matters of life and death. \n - Oh come on, this is not necessary - answered Mateusz. - Or if it is for you, go ahead and pray. But maybe we should deal with what we have to do first. \nAt once, Materek thought himself naive for thinking he's dealing with a real man of the cloth. On the other hand, could he really guess? Some really weird shit is going on down south, and - as far as the rumours go - up north as well. \n - I have come to you because you are the only sane person in the region. Well, maybe not the only one, but the only one we can strike a deal with. We either stay together or drown alone. That's it. \n - I am honored you think of me so - Materek nodded slowly - but if we are to get this done, I'll be brisk: what will we get out of it? \n - You are, and will be, the main industrial hub of the region. Our northern and eastern borders are secure, so that's a vantage point. Most importantly: we're here for the people. This counts. We're in the most war-torn region of all Poland, perhaps. Everyone is already tired of the extremists. They want hope. Normal life. And we're normal. As far as a guy dressing up as a priest is normal, but it ranks pretty high in the normalcy score. \n - This, this I can get behind. But what exactly do you offer? \nMateusz thought for a while. \n - Let's say... a non-agression pact. We should send emissaries to each other. Ambassadors, if you will. If something will go south, it will be easier to cooperate. You hold them in the north, we come from the east, and vice versa. In meantime, you have somewhere to trade. You can access Vistula through a friendly terrirory. \n - Deal - Materek nodded. - This is something we can both benefit. \n - This was quite obvious - Mateusz rose from the chair and extended his hand. - There is only one extra condition..."
sandomierz.33.a: "To the public, you were talking to a priest."

sandomierz.35.t: "The Price of a Conscience"
sandomierz.35.desc: "He walked through the hospital floors with a heavy heart. Every corridor was more or less the same - either sterile white or muted, damp yellow. In some rooms, patients hunched in pain; in others, loved ones cried helpless, sorrowful tears. He was helpless too; unable to aid the people in their suffering. His words felt empty, his prayers full of fake promise, like a white lie that maybe, through some divine providence, everything will eventually be okay. Two doctors ran past him, tending to another SCA. One of them was fresh out of college. He was frightened. They did all they could, but it was already hopeless. Ten minutes later, the man was gone - just a lifeless corpse on the cold, hard floor. After a few more desperate compressions, the doctor collapsed in resignation, exhausted. Death is always a part of the job; it's something you inadvertently factor in when choosing this career, but it's a whole other thing to actually lose someone in front of your eyes, knowing you personally failed to save them. Had the circumstances been different, maybe the patient could have made a recovery. With better equipment, they could have diagnosed the clot that ended up clogging his left coronary. They could have treated his atrial fibrillation. They could have installed stents to keep the artery pervious. So many regrets. So many tragedies that could have been avoided. And he... he felt guilty for each and every one. \n\nFather Mateusz walked through the same corridors as before, retracing his steps. Or were they different? He could hardly tell. All were host to the same kind of suffering. There was so much wrong with Sandomierz, so much left to fix, but this place seemed to be the worst of them all. He tugged at his pocket. Empty. Just like the city's coffers, there was simply nothing inside. Nothing to alleviate the pain, no money to throw at the problem to make it disappear. But he couldn't just watch. He couldn't keep returning here with nothing but commiserations, maintaining a straight face when looking into the pleading eyes of dozens of new patients, knowing that unless something were to change - in a day, a week, maybe a month if they're lucky, the warmth, the life behind them will give way to an empty, blank expression looking into the beyond. He continued to search. A single coin. One for those wilting in their hospital beds. One for those whose unfortunate life choices led to them freezing on a bench in the cold night air, hoping that the next breath will not be their last. A single coin to prevent a tragedy. A crushing debt to pay the price for all the world's suffering. Will the cost of doing the right thing prove too high to accept?"
sandomierz.35.a: "We will tend to the sick."
sandomierz.35.b: "We will leave nobody behind."
sandomierz.35.c: "Whatever the cost, we shall have both."

sandomierz.37.t: "Old Character, New Role"
sandomierz.37.desc: "The results of the scheduled meeting with the production manager were mostly expected, but they were still a considerable hit to the overall morale. Another delay, this time for three weeks... at least provisionally. Apparently, no filming can be done until the war is over - the Acting Minister's orders; not up for any negotiation. While through generous subsidy, the cast could still count on the same earnings as if they were on set, being forced to aimlessly mope around for yet another unknown period of time has contributed to everyone's visible dejection. The least Artur could do to pass the time was to stay in character during his daily walks in the City Park, putting on the black cassock he indefinitely borrowed from set and rehearsing the lines he hoped to eventually say before the cameras once the filming restarts. \n\nWhile it was nothing new for Artur to attract attention during his public appearances, always having a pen prepared for the occasional autograph,    over time, he could feel the people addressing him with increasing concern in their voices; each one troubled in their own unique way. \n\nWhenever he needed a break from the spotlight, the actor retreated for a warm cup of tea in the usually empty presbytery - pretty much the only place in the town where he could gather his thoughts. There was no denying he was homesick, a passive observer, unable to do anything other than wait for the situation in the city to improve. Lost in thought, he almost failed to register the shy knocks that preceded the arrival of his unexpected guest. \n\n- Your holiness! Oh, thank the Lord I found you here. Father Mateusz,  it's chaos out there! I can't get any sleep lately with all that's been going on. My son's out there fighting for our city, I can barely manage to take care of the house on my own... oh, and Mirek - my husband, he was mugged last Friday, can you believe that? Chaos, I tell ya. Is there anything you can do about that, Father? \n- Umm, I can certainly report the matter to the authorities. I'm sure they'll find the... - Artur began to utter in surprise. \n- No, no. You think I haven't tried that already? They told me I had to wait my turn first. Crooks, all of them. Useless, corrupt crooks. I wouldn't be surprised if they're in on it. You're my only hope. \n- M'am, what is it exactly that you expect me to do in that case? I wish I could help, but I'm only... \n- Oh, your holiness, if you could figure out who did it, you and that inspector... Moż... what was his name... Never mind, doesn't matter. I promise I'd forever be grateful. I'm sure for someone like you, it should be no issue. Please, will you help a poor old woman out? \n- I can... definitely ask around if that will bring you any comfort. \n- Oh, thank you, Father. I won't bother you any longer. I'm sure you must be very busy with all the others waiting in line for your help. \n- There are others? \n- I... guess I may have told a few people about coming here. I apologize in advance..."

unification.124.t: "[GetNewspaper]Apostles of Christ unify the Holy Cross!"
unification.124.desc: "In war-torn Poland, symbols have a newfound power, whether they be objects, concepts, or... people. The sleepy town of Sandomierz holds one such example, yet perhaps it's one more powerful than all the rest. On an unassuming day, people gathered on the Town Square to witness something inconceivable - the city's beloved icon, Father Mateusz, live in the flesh. Uniting the people with a message of catholic humanitarianism, he peacefully assumed power within Sandomierz. From there, he spread his message of harmony and freedom to communities within the region, eventually culminating in the entire voivodeship declaring their loyalty to the preacher. The real identity of the leader remains a mystery, with multiple rumors of varying credibility circulating regarding his true intentions, but perhaps miracles really do happen, and this is not merely an actor, but the actual character come to life."
