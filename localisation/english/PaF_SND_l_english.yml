unification.124.t: "[GetNewspaper]Apostles of Christ unify Holy Cross!"
unification.124.desc: "In war-torn Poland symbols have a newfound power, whether they be objects, concepts, or... people. The sleepy town of Sandomierz holds one such example, but perhaps it’s one more powerful than all the rest. On an unassuming day, people gathered on the Town Square to witness something inconceivable - the city’s beloved icon, Father Mateusz, live in the flesh. Uniting the people with a message of catholic humanitarianism, he peacefully assumed power within Sandomierz. From there, he spread his message of harmony and freedom to communities within the region, eventually culminating in the entire voivodeship declaring their loyalty to the preacher. The real identity of the leader remains a mystery, with multiple rumors circulating regarding his true intentions, but perhaps miracles really do happen and this is not merely an actor, but the actual character come to life."
unification.124.a: "The Lord blesses his flock"

super.124.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.124.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.124.a: "United at last."
