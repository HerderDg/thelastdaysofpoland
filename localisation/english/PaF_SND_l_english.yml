 POLITICS_BARTLOMIEJ_SIENKIEWICZ_DESC: "Up to this date Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz holds credit for the most accurate description of the condition of Polish state: §t„it exists only in theory… Cock, ass and a shitton of rocks”§t. These words, though not initially about Poland as a whole, are also an example of self-fulfilling prophecy, as the Poles believed them long enough that, one day, boom – they were 100%, literally, applicable to a letter. \n\nSienkiewicz, however, would not like them to be true. He was never the one to content himself with doing little. As one of the most active and prominent members of the Civic Platform and Tusk’s strong-arm, he hated Law and Justice with passion – which made him a prime target for the remnants of the ancien regime. After unsuccessful attempt to organize resistance in his hometown of Kielce, he was forced to flee east to Sandomierz, forming one of the last redoubts against encroaching Ziobro’s forces. \n\nThis is not a simple headhunt. Sienkiewicz is a symbol of what Law and Justice considers to be the source of evil. An educated, slick, anticlerical liberal, his image was cemented the moment he was spied on in a high-end restaurant in Warsaw, formulating his aforementioned definition. The whole PiS could thank Sienkiewicz, for if they could not use his figure as an allegory of Civic Platform arrogance, they would not seize power. Now, the show nears its grand finale, and Sienkiewicz has to fall. \n\nBut Sienkiewicz won’t fall. He was an actual, experienced Minister of Interior, unlike PiS lackeys, and unlike them, he did not put life into his prophecy with his own hands. Sandomierz will remain a free, European city, a beacon to cling to in face of despotism. No matter the cost."
 POLITICS_OJCIEC_MATEUSZ_DESC: "In the late twenties, much like the whole country, the historic city of Sandomierz has gone through proverbial hell, emerging from one catastrophe only to end up facing another. Though the town was largely spared from the Fall's immediate devastation, the nation's collapse nonetheless shattered the blissful status quo previously enjoyed by the residents. In a time filled with constant uncertainty, where any new day could bring either conflict, unrest, or famine, Father Mateusz represents that which the city most needed - a calm guiding hand to reassure the weary populace. For the poor souls unable to cope with the damage brought upon by the Fall and its subsequent consequences, the priest stands as a final beacon of hope to rally behind, however unproven and idealistic he may be. \n\nDespite his rapid ascent, the man bearing the beloved persona never intended to be the city's hero. At no point did he claim to be an authentic representation of the character he played, nor strive for any spotlight beyond that which his contract stipulated. But as the internal situation in Sandomierz deteriorated and trust towards the city's leadership reached an unprecedented low, the initially playful, in-character greetings quickly gave way to concerned citizens desperately turning for advice to the sole remaining authority they still trusted; the only one who showed genuine concern for their wellbeings. In many ways, Father Mateusz represents the city's collective delusion, a desire to cling to normalcy even as the world around it crumbles - a piece of fiction supposedly brought to life, a priest without ordainment, a masterful detective lacking any formal training - the contradictions matter little to those with nothing else to believe in. \n\nElevated as the city's savior on a wave of ubiquitous public support and met with thousands of expectant hearts, hoping he'll solve all of its numerous problems, Father Mateusz was cast into a position he always hoped he'd avoid. Yet, though he may otherwise steer way clear of any political power and the excesses to which it inevitably leads, the 'priest' has no choice but to wield it in full - for them, and for the millions left struggling in the remains what once used to be Poland - forgotten, alone, and afraid. To show everyone that the humanitarian spirit can survive even in the darkest of times and that though all may seem to be lost, the combined, selfless efforts of a caring community can always bring about a better tomorrow."

  SND_dusk_in_royal_city: "Dusk in the Royal City"
  SND_dusk_in_royal_city_desc: "Ahh, Sandomierz... the one place that the Fall failed to reach. Where the quiet cobbled streets still lead life at the same pace as they did for the past centuries. The royal city - an oasis of peace and home for all those fleeing persecution. The brightest light shining across a region that has otherwise descended into darkness. Even if Poland continues to fragment, and each of these fragments devotes itself to fighting the others, the Republic of Sandomierz will continue to stand above them all, free of the devastation they bring upon the country. And in time, the city will return to its full, historic glow, and nothing shall disturb its peace, unless..."
  
  SND_so_long_peace: "So Long, Peace..."
  SND_so_long_peace_desc: "...unless Ziobro comes in to finish the job. Of course. And it just had to be on Christmas of all days. As if he ever had any shame. For 'harboring the known criminal Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz, sentenced to lifetime imprisonment by the lawful government of the Third Republic,' he declared our Republic a rogue state and sent his men to end its sovereignty. What a pathetic excuse. Through what backward logic does this reason justify the simultaneous invasion of Starachowice? The truth is - the Prosecutor is out for blood, and he won't stop until the whole voivodeship kneels before him. But rather than become yet another obedient satrapy, we will fight to defend our freedom. The odds may be overwhelmingly against us, but if we can at least slightly rough him up before it's over, that should count as a moral victory."
  
  SND_turn_media_attention: "Turn Media Attention to the War"
  SND_turn_media_attention_desc: "There's a time for media pluralism, but with a hostile army rapidly encroaching on our territory, every other outlet blasting critiques of the administration is the last thing we need. So, let's get our stories straight: if you enjoy having liberties - the Prosecutorship is going to take them all away. If you wear a red heart, a green clover, or anything that isn't that damn blue eagle on your chest, you WILL face persecution if we lose this war. And if you just as much as looked at him wrong or wrote some disparaging decade-old comment you've since long forgotten about - §RZIOBRO. IS. COMING. TO. GET. YOU.§! On every channel, down to the most irrelevant regional station, this message better be the main story."
  
  SND_in_for_the_long_haul: "In for the Long Haul"
  SND_in_for_the_long_haul_desc: "Months of deadlock, one step back after another... and we're still acting like it's business as usual. Unless we want to burn ourselves out and realize one day that what little remains of our stockpiles has run dry, it's time to start taking some drastic measures. The fields we still control up north are not even close to covering existing demand. It's either rations now or famine in a month. For now, we can start off simple - some minor restrictions on the number of purchasable goods allowed per person should be enough to prevent the worst shortages. And if the people don't like it - well, it's still far better than the alternative."
  
  SND_demonize_their_forces: "Demonize Their Forces"
  SND_demonize_their_forces_desc: "The early months of the war have shown that most soldiers aren't particularly eager to kill their fellow countrymen, even if they're Ziobrites. Squeezing any effectiveness out of our troops will require the right incentives... and a good mental picture. We need to drill the image into everyone's minds - the men beyond our frontlines aren't their brothers. They're ruthless, single-minded killers who, if they hadn’t been co-opted into Ziobro’s ranks, would likely be pillaging and burning villages for fun instead. So unless they want these dogs to do as they please, every able-bodied person better give their all for the Republic, for their families, and for everyone else in the city who can't defend themselves."

So... that means the hard part should be behind us now, right? It's not like we've thrown everything we have at the enemy, angered our own people in the process, let the domestic situation deteriorate far beyond our control, absolutely ruined the city's economy, left absolutely no opportunities for the returning veterans, canceled all... is there even a point to keep listing everything that is currently wrong with Sandomierz? We have our work cut out for us. Now's no time for celebrations."

 sandomierz.1.t: "Ziobro surrenders!"
 sandomierz.1.desc: "At around 9:30 AM Sandomierz troops, moving westward, have entered a tiny town, barely stretching outside the market square, just like many others in the region. Aside a roadblock about a kilometer earlier and a couple of marauding soldiers in a village off the main road, there was no resistance. The men didn’t even try to fight, claiming that an armistice was already in effect and Ziobro’s forces were all falling back. \n\nNevertheless, Sandomirians were told to exercise usual caution when rolling onto the square. As makeshift armoured truck switched its engine off, there was nothing but silence, a bit too eerie even for such a languishing place. The town was dead. Soldiers disembarked and knocked on a couple doors, trying to find any signs of a life form with at least middling intelligence. After a while, one of the doors opened, revealing a worn-out man. \n – Have you seen Ziobro’s forces? – asked the Sandomirian sergeant. \n – Yeah, I’ve seen them. \n – Where are they now? \n – Upstairs – the man beckoned slightly towards the first floor. \n – How... how many of them? \n – Three platoons. \n\n – The windows in the house, as well as a few neighboring ones, opened, and out of each a couple of barrels, granades or makeshift throwing weapons emerged. \n – Commisar Zardecki, General Prosecutorship, nice to meet you. \n – Wwwasn’t there supposed to be armistice already? – said the Sandomirian, taking a few cautious steps back from the doors to figure out the size of shit he found himself in. \n – You know, I actually have no idea. Give me a second, I’ll call the HQ. \n\nCommisar reached for his assignated Nokia 3310 and started calling. \n– God, I hope I won’t have to deal with that idiot again... Hi, could you tell me if the armistice already in effect? I see... Complete chaos? So I guess that’s it? Alright.. Okay, thank you, goodbye. Stay safe. \n – Gentlemen – said the commisar – it seems there is no point for further hostilities. If you allow us, we shall leave the town and fall back. Men, lower your weapons.

unification.124.desc: "In war-torn Poland, symbols have a newfound power, whether they be objects, concepts, or... people. The sleepy town of Sandomierz holds one such example, yet perhaps it’s one more powerful than all the rest. On an unassuming day, people gathered on the Town Square to witness something inconceivable - the city’s beloved icon, Father Mateusz, live in the flesh. Uniting the people with a message of catholic humanitarianism, he peacefully assumed power within Sandomierz. From there, he spread his message of harmony and freedom to communities within the region, eventually culminating in the entire voivodeship declaring their loyalty to the preacher. The real identity of the leader remains a mystery, with multiple rumors of varying credibility circulating regarding his true intentions, but perhaps miracles really do happen, and this is not merely an actor, but the actual character come to life."
