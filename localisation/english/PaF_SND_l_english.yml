unification.124.t: "[GetNewspaper]Apostles of Christ unify Holy Cross!"
unification.124.desc: "In war-torn Poland symbols have a newfound power, whether they be objects, concepts, or... people. The sleepy town of Sandomierz holds one such example, but perhaps it’s one more powerful than all the rest. On an unassuming day, people gathered on the Town Square to witness something inconceivable - the city’s beloved icon, Father Mateusz, live in the flesh. Uniting the people with a message of catholic humanitarianism, he peacefully assumed power within Sandomierz. From there, he spread his message of harmony and freedom to communities within the region, eventually culminating in the entire voivodeship declaring their loyalty to the preacher. The real identity of the leader remains a mystery, with multiple rumors circulating regarding his true intentions, but perhaps miracles really do happen and this is not merely an actor, but the actual character come to life."
unification.124.a: "The Lord blesses his flock"
