unification.46.desc: "Today's news reports that the Commonwealth of Lower Silesia has united the entire region of the former voivodeship. The unstable republic made up of Poles with all political views, but believing that only together will it be possible to rebuild the country, won the first war towards full unification.\n\n President Jacek Sutryk managed to remain in power despite internal turmoils and external dangers. His authority strengthened over time and proved to be giving a sense of security for the Commonwealth's citizens. As the support of radicals on both sides declined, the troops led from Wrocław secured all major cities and the borders of Lower Silesia. The president and his government promised to introduce democratic power in the country, local administration elected by town's and municipal residents. Only the traitors of free and independent Poland will see repercussions."
