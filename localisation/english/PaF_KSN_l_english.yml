unification.9.desc:0 "New reports coming from Lubelskie claim that the large-scale fighting in the voivodeship has ceased, as the Protestant regime of Paweł Chojecki has achieved dominance over the region.\n\nChojecki, often referred to as just \"The Pastor\", has been a controversial figure for many years. He has been leading an initially fairly small Evangelical Christian community based in Lublin, called \"Church of New Covenant\", which was often accused of being a sect and a far-right organization. The Pastor is notorious for voicing his radical, often unusual positions on domestic and global politics on the online platforms, including his anti-Catholic and anti-communist, while also pro-American and pro-Israeli stances. As his power in the region grew, it's said that he's been implementing increasingly draconian religious policies, which he claims are based on the Word of God as it's presented in the Bible."
