unification.9.t: "[GetNewspaper]Biblical Kraśnik unifies Lublin Voivodeship!"
unification.9.desc: "New reports coming from Lubelskie claim that large-scale fighting in the voivodeship has completely ceased, as the staunchly Protestant regime of Paweł Chojecki has achieved dominance over the region.\nChojecki, often referred to as just \"The Pastor,\" has long been a controversial figure, garnering significant reproval from his critics. Before the Fall, he served as the leader of a fairly small Evangelical Christian community based in Lublin called \"The Church of New Covenant,\" which was frequently accused of being a sect and a far-right organization. The Pastor is notorious for voicing his radical, often unusual positions on domestic and global politics on online platforms, including his anti-Catholic and anti-communist, while also pro-American and pro-Israeli stances. As his power in the region grew, it's been reported that he's been implementing increasingly draconian religious policies, which he claims are based on the Word of God as it's infallibly presented in the Bible."
