unification.58.t: "[GetNewspaper]Piston's Alcoholics unify Wrocław Voivodeship!"
unification.58.desc: "Very unexpected news comes from the land of Lower Silesia. The area has been completely taken over by the Community of the Owl Mountains - a strange state of loosely connected communes of alcohol lovers. The region's capital, Wrocław, is already filled with the stench of liquor, which will probably linger in the air for a long time. The man in charge, Piston, is both a myth and a legend, who, after the great split of the alcoholic state, took his most faithful followers and headed north, leaving the hateful traitors behind. His traditional doctrine was utopian, but he nevertheless managed to come out on top. With little codification and enforcement of laws, it may be difficult for the Community to maintain power in such a large area, but perhaps the Polish nectar of power and peace will be the one thing that finally binds the nation together."
unification.58.a: "Let's have a drink to that!"

super.58.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.58.a: "United at last."
