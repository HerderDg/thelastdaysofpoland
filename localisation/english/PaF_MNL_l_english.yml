unification.58.t: "[GetNewspaper]Community of Owl Mountains Unites Lower Silesia"
unification.58.desc: "Very strange news comes from the land of Lower Silesia. The area was completely taken over by the Community of Owl Mountains - a strange state of loosely connected communes of alcohol lovers. There is already the smell of liquor in Wrocław, which will probably stay in the air for a long time.\n\nThe man in charge is a legend and myth called Piston, who after a great split in the alcoholic country took his most faithful people and headed north, leaving hateful traitors behind. His traditional doctrine was utopian, but he nevertheless managed to get where it is now. With so little codification and enforcement of rights, it can be difficult for the community to maintain power in such an area, but perhaps the Polish nectar of power and peace will be the binder that will connect everyone together."
unification.58.a: "Let's have a drink to that!"

super.58.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.58.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.58.a: "United at last."
