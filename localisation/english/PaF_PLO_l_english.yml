unification.171.t: "[GetNewspaper]Holy Inquisition unifies Northern Mazovia!"
unification.171.desc: "Radicalized by the emergence of the Mariavite sect as one of the regional players, the population of Płońsk called for quick and decisive action against the heretics. Local preacher [FROM.GetLeader], inspired by the city's numerous witch hunts of the past, answered their request by re-establishing the Holy Office of Inquisition. Just like its spiritual predecessor, the organization is dedicated to eradicating all sources of sorcery and heresy in Poland and possibly beyond. Despite the declared adherence to Catholic orthodoxy, the organization is not sanctioned by the Pope and has been condemned by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. Despite that, their fervor remains unshaken, as they had already crushed the hated Mariavites and used the momentum that came from that victory to conquer all of North Masovia. And despite having plenty of sinners to judge in their newly conquered land, the zealots don't plan on stopping until the rest of the country is purged from evil."
unification.171.a: "Nobody expects the Polish Inquisition!"
