unification.144.t: "[GetNewspaper]Freedom Front unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.144.desc: "After the series of failures and humiliations that defined his political career, no one expected Konrad Berkowicz to rise to any prominence. Prior to the Fall, the politician attempted to shamelessly mimic Janusz Korwin-Mikke’s seemingly successful strategy of generating as much controversy as possible with identical talking points, with meager effect. Apparently, one Korwin was enough. After his ideological mentor’s death, however, Berkowicz capitalized on the growing demand for aggressive laissez-faire rhetoric, slowly co-opting the masses disaffected with the ever-expanding social nets enforced by the country’s ruling cabinets. The subsequent collapse of the Kraków government allowed Berkowicz the opportunity to rouse his dedicated following to action and unify the unstable voivodeship. Perhaps after decades of marginalization, the radical mixture of economic ultraliberalism and social conservatism will finally emerge onto the forefront of Polish politics."
unification.144.a: "The true successor of Korwin-Mikke"

super.144.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.144.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.144.a: "United at last."
