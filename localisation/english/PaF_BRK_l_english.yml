unification.144.t: "[GetNewspaper]Freedom Front unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.144.desc: "No one expected to see Berkowicz rise to prominance after the series of the humiliations that was his political career. Before the Fall his go-to strategy was to mimic the seemingly succesful tactic of Janusz Korwin-Mikke by raising as much controversies as possible with identical talking points. His strategy didin't succeed back then. Apparently, one Korwin was enough. But after Korwin's death there was a raising demand for this kind of agressive laissez-faire rethoric. And Berkowicz delivered unifying his voivodeship when the Cracow government collapsed. Who knows, maybe after decades of being ignored he will finally rise to prominance."
unification.144.a: "True successor of Korwin-Mikke"

super.144.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.144.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
