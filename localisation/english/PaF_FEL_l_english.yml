 POLITICS_JACEK_KOWALSKI_DESC:0 "Professor Jacek Kowalski is a man belonging to the ages long past. Values he adheres to are little different then those prized 200 years ago or more. His bearing is proud, his faith uncompromised, and even though his beliefs are clearly defined, he treats people of different vievs with as much respect as they’re due; a rare gift among his ideological collegues. A historian, bard and erudite, Kowalski praised past glories of Polish and European chivalry from the age of the Crusades through the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth up until the Partitions and 20th century struggles for independence. \n\nOnce again, the times are dire, and enemies have torn Poland asunder. Times are strange and the world queers, there is no time to be lost! Jacek Kowalski turned to the Polish tradition of self-organisation of virtuous individuals and invited artists to his safe haven in Kórnik, along with all those who wished for return of the „Sarmatian” principles: direct democracy, chivalric duty, staunch Catholicism and, most importantly, Golden Liberty. Together they confederated and elected Kowalski Hetman and Marshall of the Confederation. \n\nThe system proposed by Kowalski and his adherents might seem outlandish, especially given that it’s original application is often claimed to be the main cause of Poland’s fall in the 18th century. Its adherents claim the system stems directly from Polish national character, and instead of trying to fix the result, one should focus on the cause and keep the Poles virtuous, noble, proud, pious, chivalrous and untainted by corrupting Western liberal thought. Who could do that job better than an art historian and a poet?"
