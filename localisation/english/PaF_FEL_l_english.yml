FEL_golden_liberty_desc: "Though fragile, our system relies on the human sense of honesty and responsibility to the nation. If a person sees their neighbor breaking the law, they are to immediately organize a foray and bring the criminal to justice. Sometimes it does just end in their house going up in flames however. Many find this agreement highly amicable. Especially because they don't have the duty to follow the law while sober."

FEL_popuszczac_czy_nie_popuszczac_desc: "Difficult times have forced us to relegate a lot of power to a narrow group of a modern szlachta, that has the right to participate in sejmiks and hold key positions in our ruling structure. When the Fall happened, this was an excellent way to hold onto at least a sliver of the former democratic institutions. It was a means to an end meant to re-organize daily life and some semblance of government. Though now some people that have been excluded from this exclusive group of nobility have been demanding free speech and the creation of a new constitution. Meanwhile, during sejmiks in Środa Wielkopolska voices have been growing louder and louder about the salvational nature of our form of governance and the possibility of granting even more privileges to the current reigning class."

FEL_hultajstwo_tysiacami_wali_desc: "\"In the name of Almighty God. I hereby begin my connotations on the history of the state like no ever was in Poland, Lithuania or Ruthenia, known first as Terra Felix, whose humble beginnings I had the unique opportunity to witness with my own eyes, and thus - I have the duty to preserve for the memory of generations to come. \n\nThis piece of land where it all begun was but a minuscule part of a realm vast and powerful, Sarmatia, also known as the joyful land, the Terra Felix. Tossed like a dinghy lost upon raging ocean, it was saved by the Boat of Professor Hetman Jacek Kowalski, a man of Old Polish virtue and unyielding fortitude. Once he was firmly acclaimed as the leader of fledging statelet, it would seem that winds of history had finally blown into state's sails advantageously. However, common experience of our ancestors assures that no calm seas last for long, and soon enough a new whirlwind was born. \n\nThis time, however, the calamity was not external; it has been born among free and equal citizens of the Commonwealth. Many of them, impoverished by the hardships of recent years, eagerly exploited the opportunity to improve their material situation, and strived to turn their abodes into humble, but respectable mansions. They sought every piece of land that they could turn into income, but alas, in such a statelet, scarcity akin to Eris, the goddess of strife, bound them to clash over a small prize...\""
FEL_knightly_pride_desc: "...among many such cases, one had borne disastrous consequences. A certain nobleman, who (as was the fashion of the time) adopted the somewhat typical name of Seweryn Soplica, had a sister, who was married to his neighbour, of Annopolscy family. As ancient custom demanded, she had been given a dowry, that is, the village of Bożydar. Soplica, as soon as he had begun to manage his estates himself, being young and unexperienced, rapidly lost the respect for tradition his new name would suggest. Seeking to reinforce his falling revenue, he began to covet his sister's dowry, claiming it was wrangled from his family unlawfully by Annopolscy's intrigue. Being young and adventorous, he decided he would not seek justice in courts, but do it with his own hand, or, precisely, by the hand of knightly estate, formed into fist known as another ancient tradition, the foray..."
FEL_weapons_in_hands_desc: "...having taken unsuspecting adversaries by a swift strike, the forayers, with their need of justice satiated, moved onto those more basic needs, such as food, drink and avarice. Thus, they begun to rob not only the contended estate, but surrounding villages as well. Seeing that, all kinds of rabble-rousers, troublemakers, hungry and dispossesed followed suit, and ranks of the bandits begun to swell. \n\nOnce news to this was relayed to Field Hetmaness of the Crown Lady Beata Kozidrak, she was quick to understand this was about to become a full blown rebellion against the Hetman, and no time could be lost. Of course, if the matters were to be resolved per viam legalem, that is, according to the law of the Commonwealth, she would have to force herself to watch as the fire grows and escapes all ways of containment. Any dawdling on behalf of the Senators could be, perchance, remedied by the Hetman - but truth be told, the Hetmaness distrusted him when it came to handling urgents matters of state, and thought his prudence a timidity, and his peaceability a squeamishness... So she called upon the men under her command, assembled as much as she could find, and, proclaiming the highest peril of the liberty and a threat to all of Commonwealth, rushed to Bożydar and descended like a thunder upon the unsuspecting victors..."
FEL_horses_in_jump_desc: "...as this unraveled, Professor Hetman has been enjoying himself in the sollicitude of his temporary homestead, playing lute, and knew not of recent occurences. But the Ministers themselves rushed to inform him. Soon, as Chancellor and Treasurer came to him in personis suis, Professor realised well they bore grave news, and a shadow crossed his face. Had the Ministers related a rebellion was ongoing, and blood has already had been spilled, Kowalski grieved severely, for he realised peaceful solution had slipped from his reach, and an armed hand had to fall upon quarelling brothers..."
FEL_i_w_nich_jak_w_dym_desc: "...but truth be told, even as bloodshed between brothers was resolved with force of arms, a worse issue loomed large. The forces of the Commonwealth served pro publico bono with great ardour, nonetheless their payrolls had been greatly neglected. As loyal soldiers overcame rebel forces, they were themselves overcome by their own poverty, sometimes even starvation... Many knights, as soon as their eyes fell upon supplies and belongings of the enemy, turned to brigands themselves, and foregoing every law of war, they set to plunder the haphazard camp of the rebels. Having looted whatever they could find in it, they moved onto nearby villages, and put a harsh yoke on the peasants, squeezing whatever scraps they had. \n\nGreed rose to levels yet unseen in the history of nascent state, and it brought dire consequences... Particularly unruly of men of the noble levy tracked some rebels as they fled the onslaught, who, in their desperation, drove off to the Sich... Arrogant and voracious as they were, nobles demanded their release so they could do their will with the refugees. As Cossacks refused, nobles decided to rush in, and were met with gunfire. Thus, as one fire was extinguished, it bore a spark which could lead to a much more disastrous inferno..."
FEL_dont_cry_sister_of_brother_desc: "...a crisis like that could only be solved by an Extraordinary Sejm, but everyone, who had any knowledge of what the citizens of the Commonwealth thought and felt at the time, could anticipate it is going to be an arduous task. Widespread mourning and fresh wounds made any discussion laden with grief, and every part of the nobility looked upon the others with fear and resentment, looking only for a pretext to jump to their throats... The one thing that the whole chamber had in common was fear of the peasants and Cossacks, but even this looming threat could not bring enough unity and common sense as for the parlamentarians to unite...

felix.1.t: "The Relief of Jarocin"
felix.1.desc: "On an August night, the Hetman's troops stood upon the Warta river in Krzykosy, close to the only bridges linking the two shores. They all knew the perils ahead, and they all were prepared. After a tense wait, at last, Jacek Kowalski - the Professor-Hetman, arrived on a nearby hill along with his entourage of ministers, officers, and close associates. After a few minutes of preparations, he began his speech. \n\n 'Brothers! We stand here today, on the coast of this river, to bring aid to our kin in Jarocin!' By his side stood representatives of all the counties which so desperately begged for his aid - Jarocin, Śrem, Gostyń, Krotoszyn, Rawicz, and Pleszew.\n\n'Those fools who invaded our nation, just like the perfidious Swedes nearly 400 years ago, brought to our lands by traitors' hands, will witness our justice and their crimes will be wiped away with blood!'\n\n Once the speech was over, the Hetman's armies received an order to get to their positions - the Sarmatian offensive on Jarocin has begun.\n\n Following a brief field prayer, the troops entered their boats and set upon the enemy lines. Most were unsure if they shall live until the next day, but at the same time, they felt pride in serving their country, even if a heroic death was to be their only reward for it.\n\nLieutenant Nowak commanded one of the first companies to land on the other side of the Warta. Its job was to secure the village of Komorze, and later Czocicza with its crucial train station. They went through the muddy fields and entered Czocicza around 6:10 am., securing the station amidst heavy resistance from the enemy units. 20 minutes later a train from Terra Felix stood upon the very same tracks on which they fought. The battle had been won and all that was needed was to unpack the carriages and escort the supplies to appropriate storage posts."

unification.33.t: "[GetNewspaper]Sarmatia unifies Southern Greater Poland"
unification.33.desc: "Forces of ages-old tradition triumph in Southern Greater Poland as a dietine in Środa has proclaimed the reunification of the region by the forces of the confederated citizens of Sarmatia. After a solemn mass in the collegiate church, among fireworks, gunfire, and revelry, the assembled crowd cheered the hetman Jacek Kowalski, who thanked God for helping him prevail over his rivals and proclaimed the will to restitute the Commonwealth. The state led by Kowalski is a curious mix of anachronistic customs, minimal state institutions, and a radical implementation of the principles of direct democracy. Harkening back to the times of so-called noble republicanism, it tries to balance self-organization, nearly absolute personal freedom, and staunch Catholicism. Many predict the statelet will eventually collapse into anarchy, but since it prevailed in the regional struggle without any significant issues, it might actually enjoy the protection of the Virgin Mary."

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_JACEK_KOWALSKI_DESC: "Professor Jacek Kowalski is a man belonging to the ages long past. Values he adheres to are little different then those prized 200 years ago or more. His bearing is proud, his faith uncompromised, and even though his beliefs are clearly defined, he treats people of different vievs with as much respect as they're due; a rare gift among his ideological collegues. A historian, bard and erudite, Kowalski praised past glories of Polish and European chivalry from the age of the Crusades through the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth up until the Partitions and 20th century struggles for independence. \n\nOnce again, the times are dire, and enemies have torn Poland asunder. Times are strange and the world queers, there is no time to be lost! Jacek Kowalski turned to the Polish tradition of self-organisation of virtuous individuals and invited artists to his safe haven in Kórnik, along with all those who wished for return of the \"Sarmatian\" principles: direct democracy, chivalric duty, staunch Catholicism and, most importantly, Golden Liberty. Together they confederated and elected Kowalski Hetman and Marshall of the Confederation. \n\nThe system proposed by Kowalski and his adherents might seem outlandish, especially given that it's original application is often claimed to be the main cause of Poland's fall in the 18th century. Its adherents claim the system stems directly from Polish national character, and instead of trying to fix the result, one should focus on the cause and keep the Poles virtuous, noble, proud, pious, chivalrous and untainted by corrupting Western liberal thought. Who could do that job better than an art historian and a poet?"
