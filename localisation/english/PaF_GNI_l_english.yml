 GNI_spirit_of_the_casimir_the_restorer_desc: "Żaden władca z dawnych lat tak dobrze nie wpisuje się w nasze potrzeby. Odbudował to co zniszczyły inne ludy, oraz nasi przodkowie uniesieni reakcją pogańską.Choć umarł młodo, podołał wydawałoby się niemożliwemu zadaniu. Dziś my musimy kontynuować jego dzieło i ofiarnie wykuć na nowo to, co niegdyś zawiodło..."

unification.32.t: "[GetNewspaper]Gniezno unifies Southern Greater Poland"
unification.32.desc: "Heralds rush across Southern Greater Poland with a message of utmost importance; The entire region has been unified by the nation of Medievalists housed in the former Polish capital of Gniezno.\n\nAfter the Fall, they took charge of the area surrounding Gniezno and Konin, where upon calming the population’s nerves, they created a nation calling back to the old, Piast tales along with professor Przemysław Urbańczyk at it’s helm, who took up the name Przemysł III. They set upon restoring a Piast kingdom, expanding to Kalisz and then marching west, securing the region with their Princely Brigades.\n\nIt appears that despite their unsteady past the people of Greater Poland can sleep easy - Prince Przemysł III only cares about restoring the Crown, with no associated chaos."
unification.32.a: "If it ain't broke... Oh wait."

super.32.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
