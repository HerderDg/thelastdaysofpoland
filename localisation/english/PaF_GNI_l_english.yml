unification.32.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Gniezno unifies Southern Greater Poland"
unification.32.desc:0 "Heralds rush across Southern Greater Poland with a message of utmost importance; The entire region has been unified by the nation of Medievalists housed in the former Polish capital of Gniezno.\n\nAfter the Fall, they took charge of the area surrounding Gniezno and Konin, where upon calming the population’s nerves, they created a nation calling back to the old, Piast tales along with professor Przemysław Urbańczyk at it’s helm, who took up the name Przemysł III. They set upon restoring a Piast kingdom, expanding to Kalisz and then marching west, securing the region with their Princely Brigades.\n\nIt appears that despite their unsteady past the people of Greater Poland can sleep easy - Prince Przemysł III only cares about restoring the Crown, with no associated chaos."
unification.32.a:0 "If it ain't broke... Oh wait."
