 unification.162.t: "[GetNewspaper]Red Bear Collective unifies Capital Region"
 unification.162.desc: "In 1976 Ursus Tractor Industry Plants were one of the many hotspots of workers' strikes against the sudden price increase caused by the government. It would seem that after the Fall, Ursus District's loyalty to the left remained, although due to post-1989 deindustrialization, it reemerged in a new form. In 2027 the district was ruled by an anarchist group called Red Bear Collective. Despite their radical leftist alignment, the group focuses primarily on social issues such as the hardships of LGBTQ+ people and the problem of safe abortion instead of on worker's rights. Initially, Ursus district was just a safe haven for the disenfranchised and oppressed. However, during the turbulent years after 2025, the Collective decided that passivity equaled destruction. Under the leadership of Małgorzata \"Margot\" Szutowicz and her comrades from the dissolved \"Stop Bullshit\" collective the Red Bear went on the offensive, eventually dominating the despised, liberal Warsaw."
