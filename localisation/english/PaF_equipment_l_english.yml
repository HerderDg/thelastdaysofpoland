 melee_equipment: "Melee Equipment"
 melee_equipment_desc: "Category of equipment including weapons and tools that find their use in warzones - shovels, knives, picks and clubs to dig holes in earth and in enemy skulls."
 melee_equipment_0: "Found & Selfmade Melee Weapons"
 melee_equipment_0_desc: "Baseball bats, kitchen knives, batons, knuckledusters, metal pipes, garden tools, glass shivs, etc. - anything that can be found in a house, a warehouse, an abandoned kiosk, in your grandpa's garden or made with your own hands. Not very sophisticated, nor very useful against someone with a gun."
 melee_equipment_1: "Standardized Old Melee Weapons"
 melee_equipment_1_desc: "Found machetes, axes, tools and hunting knives that could be used in an army, renovated and standardized across our ranks, so that our sappers no longer have to dig with sticks and soup spoons."
 melee_equipment_2: "Purpose-Made Melee Weapons"
 melee_equipment_2_desc: "Tools and melee weapons designed in mind with urban and trench combat. Slightly reminiscent of WW1 trench weaponry."
 melee_equipment_3: "Army Melee Equipment"
 melee_equipment_3_desc: "Knives, shovels and other equipment that would serve well in a modern army, with an additional renovated antique saber or shovel thrown in here and there among melee stormtroopers, just to make your ancestors extra proud."
 melee_equipment_4: "Top-Quality Melee Equipment"
 melee_equipment_4_desc: "Top notch modern military melee equipment that looks straight out of an American shop for knife enthusiasts. All multi-purpose, all cold to the touch, all black as death in colour (with cool white finishes near the edges)."
 melee_weapons_upgrade: "Serrations"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_desc: "In post-Fall Poland, brute strength is the be-all, end-all argument. No one cares about the rules of war - everyone is an acceptable casualty. Especially since people die left and right even outside of battle, due to the lack of medical goods and infrastructure. The only way to avoid death here is to play dirty, and speaking of dirty: all these rusty knives and tools lying around could come in handy, especially with some new teeth carved onto their blades."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_1: "Proper Refurbishment & Maintenance"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_1_desc: "Our soldats have received weapons matching their role. They've been properly refurbished - they're theirs now, so they need to last for long and be in good condition. By giving our troops a basic rundown of how to maintain them and providing army-wide access to equipment such as grit paper, sharpening stones and heavy-duty tape we can ensure that their weapons won't snap in half or turn out to be completely blunt while they try to batter someone down with them."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_2: "Hand-to-Hand Combat Training"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_2_desc: "Stabbing without getting stabbed back. Pacifying enemy combatants with a single baton hit to the head. Taking accurate axe swings at enemies. Studying the blade. \n\nBy training our close quarter divisions the art of hand-to-hand combat we ensure that when two bunches of brutes meet on the battlefield, the bunch of brutes that belongs to us will come out on top."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_3: "Safe Engagement Tactics"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_3_desc: "As all rabble armies and bandit groups evolved into proper armies, guns became a mainstay on Polish battlefields. If we are to continue using troops dedicated for point-blank range combat, we have to engineer tactics that will allow our men to close the distance between them and enemies without taking 20 bullets to the face first."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_4: "CQC Mastery"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_4_desc: "We have mastered urban close quarters combat thanks to a confluence of innovative infiltration of enemy positions and skillful positioning and movement. Cunning and deadly effective, our melee-oriented stormtroopers are able to uphold and penetrate any city defense lines with ease."
 ranged_equipment: "Small Arms"
 ranged_equipment_desc: "Category of equipment covering any man-portable ranged weaponry - pistols, rifles, bows, machine guns, hand grenades, javelins, munitions or even rocks."
 ranged_equipment_0: "Thrown Weapons"
 ranged_equipment_0_desc: "Bricks and stones may break one's bones, but good luck trying to throw a fucking rock at someone who's actually armed."
 ranged_equipment_1: "Traumatic Weapons"
 ranged_equipment_1_desc: "Found or homemade traumatic weapons and BB guns. While using them in combat might feel silly, they might give you some edge over a bloke with a knife."
 ranged_equipment_2: "Makeshift Firearms"
 ranged_equipment_2_desc: "Homemade pipe shotguns and Sten- and Błyskawica-style SMGs. Just holding these in your hands makes you feel like a Warsaw resistance fighter."
 ranged_equipment_3: "Cold War-Era Firearms"
 ranged_equipment_3_desc: "Good ol' AKs and AK derivatives, along with other weapons commonly sold on the black market. While quite unwieldy in comparison to modern firearms, they more than make up for their weight and recoil with how easy they are to clean and maintain."
 ranged_equipment_4: "Modern Firearms"
 ranged_equipment_4_desc: "Rifles, carbines and LMGs used by most European armies. Now you only need to slap some underbarrel grenade launchers and red dots on it to top it off."
 ranged_equipment_5: "Modern Firearms & Attachments"
 ranged_equipment_5_desc: "Modern weapons with commonly available, standardized weapon attachments, on par with French and British pew-pews."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade: "Weapons Of Ye Olden Days"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade_desc: "We lack guns, and we have to resort to using the simplest, most primitive ways to kill people from afar - that's why we should adopt the weaponry of our ancestors: bows, crossbows, slings and javelins - weapons that are easy to manufacture without industrial tools, yet can still kill and provide leverage over people armed with just shovels and bayonets."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade1: "Homemade Riot Shotguns"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade1_desc: "Traumatic weapons lack the range and stopping power of conventional firearms, reducing their usefulness outside of close quarter encounters. While we can't do too much about their effective range, we can, for example, adapt them to be used specifically at short-to-mid ranges and simply add more pellets per shot to increase their stopping power. Because as we all know - if a problem can't be solved by using a gun, then the best way to deal with it is to use MORE gun. \n\nMore shot, actually."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade2: "Safety Standards"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade2_desc: "It's understandably hard to make functioning guns with nothing but springs and pipes in barns and basements, but we should still include some standards of safety for our weapons so that they don't explode in our hands just because a small breadcrumb made its way into the chamber."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade3: "Cold War-Era Vision Equipment"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade3_desc: "We may have the weapons to conduct larger scale warfare, but we still lack the technology for it. Small-scale adoption of old, Soviet-era scopes, night vision and thermal vision equipment, as well as other devices used for tracking movement and viewing enemy positions could help us out in that department. Just don't use this stuff to spy on them while they're showering, please."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade4: "Special Ammo Types"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade4_desc: "One of the benefits of weapons from later NATO days is the standarization of calibers across weapon of the same type. Thanks to the fact that the same bullets match most guns in one unit, we can much more comfortably implement special ammo types into our army, as we no longer have to buy 20 different calibers serving the exact same purpose."
 infantry_training_desc: "'Jump, do ten squats, get down and give me twenty.' -- the most basic physical training that prepares our boys for action."
 infantry_training1: "Basic Infantry Training"
 infantry_training1_desc: "Teaching how to provide first aid to fallen teammates and going through most basic battle tactics will sharply increase survivability of our troops and is the first step towards shaping them into a real army, instead of the more or less organized mob they currently are."
 infantry_training2: "Advanced Infantry Training"
 infantry_training2_desc: "An extremely effective and important way of training our soldiers' reflexes, aim and independent thinking in the heat of action is to set them off against each other in very intensive and painful paintball matches. Before implementing this system, we simply unloaded entire mags of paint balls at them."
 infantry_training3: "Advanced Infantry Training II"
 infantry_training3_desc: "Physical and mental training that ensures our men don't snap under the harsh realities of post-Fall combat."
 infantry_training4: "Advanced Infantry Training III"
 infantry_training4_desc: "Army command and warfare techniques that simultaneously prepare us for large-scale combat and don't neglect our experiences and ability to defend against guerilla tactics used against smaller warlord cliques."
 infantry_training5: "Advanced Infantry Training IV"
 infantry_training5_desc: "Ex-NATO-inspired methods of training armies, with improvements based on our own experiences in the Polish Civil War. With top-tier training like this and so much army experience, our enemies can count on us that we will be ready. We will be effective. We will be deadly. If a joint European-Russian invasion was to be launched, if the walls were to come crashing down - we'll make it through. We will fight back. And FINALLY...   perhaps FINALLY our soldiers will learn that '4' in Roman numerals is written as 'IV', not 'IIII'."
 army_uniform: "Random Found Clothes"
 army_uniform_desc: "Things thick enough to soften a knife stab or a club hit. Literally anything falls into this category, from thick hoodies and winter jackets to carpets worn as makeshift protective ponchos."
 infantry_armor1: "Found Protective Equipment"
 infantry_armor1_desc: "Found knee pads, elbow pads, bike and motorcycle helmets, etc. Won't protect you from a knife, but at least you won't scratch your knees if you fall to the floor after getting stabbed."
 infantry_armor2: "Improvised Protective Plates"
 infantry_armor2_desc: "Metal plates meant to (partially) protect from melee weapons and shrapnel. Not as cool as WW1 full metal armors, but more effective and way easier to wear."
 infantry_armor3: "Old Flak Vests"
 infantry_armor3_desc: "Body armor protecting against case fragments from high-explosive weaponry, like grenade fragments or anti-aircraft flak. Won't protect you from a bullet, though."
 infantry_armor4: "Riot Police Gear"
 infantry_armor4_desc: "Menacing-looking riot police armor designed to protect from close range attacks, including small caliber bullets."
 infantry_armor5: "Modern CQC Gear"
 infantry_armor5_desc: "Modern protective equipment that ensures their user's survival in case of an unfortunate frontal meetup with a bullet."
 army_uniform1: "Semi-Standardized Camo-Pattern Clothes"
 army_uniform1_desc: "Anything covered in camo patterns, from hoodies and boxer shorts to old army and scout uniforms. Most of them don't fit, have holes in them and aren't actually designed for combat."
 camouflage_upgrade1: "Old Uniforms & Combat Vests"
 camouflage_upgrade1_desc: "Most of the army clothes we've been using so far were just civilian or mil-themed products that aren't actually viable for camouflage. Instead, we should re-adapt old uniforms and combat vests that were actually designed for combat and tested in practice."
 army_uniform2: "Cold War-Era Camo Patterns"
 army_uniform2_desc: "Slightly newer (but still very old - just not AS old) camos that the Polish army used back when Poland was still a thing."
 camouflage_upgrade2: "Modern Uniforms & Combat Vests"
 camouflage_upgrade2_desc: "Modern army uniforms and combat vests, on par with those used by most second world countries' militaries. Since this is Poland, they still use camo patterns that are outdated by at least 20 years - thanks to all the concrete-heads in our military."
 army_uniform3: "Modern Camo Patterns"
 army_uniform3_desc: "Now that we're *almost* a proper state, we can finally fix the single biggest mistake of the old Polish army: outdated camouflage patterns. \nOk, but seriously speaking: even Ukraine managed to quickly come up with something much more modern and appropiate for the situation when War in Donbass broke out in 2014, meanwhile we just sat on our arses and kept crying 'WAAAAH IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE FOR US TO DESIGN SOMETHING NEW WAAAAAAAAH NOOO WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PROPERLY OUTFIT OUR ARMY WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH'. \nLike... c'mon, it's time to finally do something with what our army wears in battle."
 special_forces_equipment: "Special Forces Equipment"
 special_forces_equipment_desc: "Category of equipment used by troops that specialize in specific roles."
 special_forces_equipment_0: "Found Special Forces Equipment"
 special_forces_equipment_0_desc: "Things of mostly civilian origin that can be repurposed for specialized troopers focusing on combat in specific terrain types, like tools and clothes for camping in the mountains, equipment for digging in and setting up traps in dense woods, safety vests and drysuits, pontoons, kayaks and sea-going boats that can be transported by land or repurposed skydiving equipment."
 special_forces_equipment_1: "Purpose-Made Special Forces Equipment"
 special_forces_equipment_1_desc: "Purpose-made equipment designed specifically for our special forces, such as more durable military parachutes, mountaineer and forester equipment, ghillie suits or boats and pontoons for our marine corps."
 special_forces_equipment_2: "Advanced Special Forces Equipment"
 special_forces_equipment_2_desc: "Modern special forces equipment allowing our special divisions to thrive in their habitat."
 special_forces_training_desc: "Basic infantry training that also includes a walkthrough on most basic goals and tactics employed by their respective unit, such as more organized movement in harsh terrain or using said terrain against their enemies."
 special_forces_training2: "Advanced Special Forces Training"
 special_forces_training2_desc: "Training of battle techniques employed by men from the harshiest regions and toughest units. Our mountaineers will shoot from around rocks and rough peaks like the Taliban, our forest specialists and guerillas will hide like the Vietcong, our marines will take the most fortified coasts like tsunami waves and our paratroopers will land safe and sound."
 special_forces_quantity: "Rural Enlistment"
 special_forces_quantity_desc: "As our borders widen, so does our landscape diversity. Recruiting from both our heartland and provincial villages that already deal with harsher life and terrain will provide us with both *more* manpower and more *experienced* manpower. \n\n"
 special_forces_quantity1: "Specialized Recruitment"
 special_forces_quantity1_desc: "Recruits already familiar with types of terrain we need troops for should be automatically assigned for future service in corresponding elite units. There's no reason why a Masurian who's spent his life fishing and kayaking for a hobby should waste his knowledge and experience on sitting in the back lines as an artilleryman."
 special_forces_quantity3: "Regional Pride"
 special_forces_quantity3_desc: "Bersaglieri, arditi, gurkhas - these are some examples of well known regional troops, serving as sources of regional pride for their homelands, and speaking of pride - nationalism and pride are some of the most easy to exploit feelings that have been used for centuries by different governments to lure people to serve in their armies. By capitalizing on regional sentimentalisms amongst our montane, forest and seaside populations we can form a new identity of speciality and servitude to the state, which in turn can build stories and hearsay about their achievements that will bring in hundreds of new recruits wishing to live up to their local heroes' names."
 special_forces_quality: "Regional Enlistment"
 special_forces_quality_desc: "As our borders widen, so does our landscape diversity - why spend additional time and resources on turning Warszawiaks or other city dwellers into mountaineers, forest skirmishers and marine troops when we can seek recruits amongst villagers that already occupy specific terrain types? This additional bit of experience with living in less optimal conditions will come in handy if we want to create forces tasked with handling very specific battlefields. \n\n"
 special_forces_quality1: "Survivalism"
 special_forces_quality1_desc: "It's hard to provide supplies to units whose job is to take the hardest fights onto themselves or to hide in mountains and forests. If we are to upkeep so many people in our special battalions, then we have to teach them how to forage and steal food from the local populace, or potentially even how to survive a day or two on an empty stomach."
 special_forces_quality3: "The Army's Pride"
 special_forces_quality3_desc: "Just like the US Marines got their reputation from handling the most dangerous operations the US Army's tasked with, our special troops pride themselves on fighting in the worst conditions, often utilizing said conditions as yet another tool in their hands - and given the rather rudimentary means with which we have to fight, their victories and craftiness are even more impressive."
 inf_anti_tank_equipment: "AT Equipment"
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_desc: "Category of equipment used to pierce through and destroy heavily armored vehicles such as tanks, IFVs or APCs."
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_0: "Primitive AT Weapons"
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_0_desc: "Molotovs and cannons made from large pipes using calcium carbide as gunpowder and sharpened metal rails as ammo. While they lack conventional stopping power, they're sure to make a tank driver stop in place and wonder what the fuck did just happened."
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Improvised AT Weapons"
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Molotovs, homemade rocket launchers, AT mines, lunge mines and improvized, Tankgewehr or Uruguay-like anti-tank rifles with enough power to simultaneously dislocate the user's shoulder AND slightly scratch tank armor in just one shot."
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Cold War-Era AT Weapons"
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Classic AT weaponry, mostly Soviet in origin. Stuff like RPGs, TM-46s, or anything else falling into the 'old but gold' category."
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Modern AT Weapons"
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "Western-imported AT weaponry or copies of Eastern anti-tank equipment - modern weapons that could pose a challenge even to European armor."
 inf_antitank_upgrade: "Capped Armour Piercing Rounds"
 inf_antitank_upgrade_desc: "By using special caps made out of weaker metal in our anti-tank weapons, we are able to limit the spattering of a missile/bullet/whatever else we're lauching at our enemies."
 inf_antitank_upgrade1: "Composite Rigid Armour Piercing Rounds"
 inf_antitank_upgrade1_short: "APCR Rounds"
 inf_antitank_upgrade1_desc: "An addition of a very heavy and tough metal core in the inside of a round grants better armor piercing capabilities as the core handles the responsibilities of a cap and a ballistic cap."
 inf_antitank_upgrade2: "High Explosive Anti-Tank Missile"
 inf_antitank_upgrade2_short: "HEAT Missiles"
 inf_antitank_upgrade2_desc: "A staple of modern personal anti-tank weapons. Such missiles upon a hit create a stream of high-velocity metalic superplastic that is capable of penetrating even the biggest and strongest armors."
 bicycle_equipment: "Bicycles"
 bicycle_equipment_desc: "Bicycles are common both in the cities and the countryside, don't need any additional training to use and can be easily produced and maintained. They're the natural choice of mobility vehicle for most warlord armies across Poland."
 bicycle_equipment_1: "Bicycle"
 bicycle_equipment_1_desc: "Bicycles are common both in the cities and the countryside, don't need any additional training to use and can be easily produced and maintained. They're the natural choice of mobility vehicle for most warlord armies across Poland."

 armored_car_equipment_3: "Cold War-Era Armored Car"
 armored_car_equipment_3_desc: "BRDM-1s, BRDM-2s and other Cold War-era armored car models that have been copied or bought from third world country smugglers. They're leagues above homemade armored cars, but then again - what isn't."
 armored_car_equipment_4: "Modern Armored Car"
 armored_car_equipment_4_desc: "Modern armored cars and other lighter reconnaissance vehicles. Copies of Polish AMZ Dzik-3s and AMZ Turs, or bought foreign models from the '80s and later (like the French ERCs and VBLs)."
 nsb_armored_car_1: "Adaptation to Off-road Conditions"
 nsb_armored_car_1_desc: "No matter how hard you're gonna try, how much you're gonna cry, how loud you're gonna scream and how fervently you're gonna pray - you can't go over 30 in off-road conditions with an ironclad Yaris. You CAN, however, turn it into an improvised 4x4 with the suspension of a buggy (and then attempt 50)."
 nsb_armored_car_2: "Improved Armor Designs"
 nsb_armored_car_2_desc: "Shells, molotovs and grenades continue to be a major pain in the ass for our vehicles. As such, we need to adapt our armor designs to handle these dangers more easily."
 nsb_armored_car_3: "Vehicle Armament Upgrade"
 nsb_armored_car_3_desc: "We've shifted from modded civilian cars to proper military recon vehicles, and now it's also time to completely move on from mounting infantry weapons onto our armored vehicles - it's time to start integrating modern weapon systems into our vehiclar forces."
 nsb_armored_car_4: "Increased AT Measures"
 nsb_armored_car_4_desc: "The types of recon vehicles we buy from abroad can vary from standard, bulky armored vehicles to riot control vehicles and even heavily armored jeeps equiped with integrated weapon systems that units wanted to get rid of in exchange for some money. These lighter, more car-like armored cars get completely wrecked by any artillery projectiles and explosive weapons, thus we need to outfit them with additional anti-armor weaponry and anti-explosive protection measures to allow them to more easily operate in the vicinity of enemy armor."

 apc_equipment_desc: "Category of vehicles consisting of various heavily armored vehicles used for transporting infantry. Technicals are also there."
 apc_equipment_1: "Technical"
 apc_equipment_1_desc: "Elusive. Evasive. Persistent. Righteous traits for a rogue's vehicle. \n\nPickup trucks outfitted with mounted machine guns or heavier weaponry, serving as symbols of one's power and prestige in civil war scenarios. In battle they fill the niche of light cavalry. \n\nA certified warlord classic."
 apc_equipment_2: "Semi-Standardized Improvised APC"
 apc_equipment_2_desc: "Sizeable civilian delivery cars and microbuses that have been partially standardized, adapted to off-road conditions, covered in a layer of bulletproof armor and sandbags and equiped with one or two guns mounted at the windows or in makeshift gun turrets. Even the designers themselves don't know why this thing fucking works."
 apc_equipment_3: "Cold War-Era APC"
 apc_equipment_3_desc: "Bought or found and refurbished APCs from early-to-mid periods of the Cold War. Chaingun- and autocannon-armed beasts capable of burning through diesel fuel faster than the entire Chinese economy. Models such as the LAV II family, Soviet BTR-70s or BTR-60s and their Polish-Czechoslovak version - the OT-64 SKOT."
 apc_equipment_4: "Modern APC"
 apc_equipment_4_desc: "What did the '90s bring to us? The Internet, the fall of USSR and the Pegasus console. But that's off-topic; After the USSR fell, the Russians have finally realised that it's safer for infantry to dismount from their vehicles from the back, rather than from the side, so they've designed the BTR-80 and the BTR-90, both of which still have doors on the sides. In the meantime, the West started adding AT rocket systems and unmanned gun turrets to their APCs. \nCopied Rosomaks, Partia AMVs and other, foreign designs, like the BTR-90, Boxer, Saur 1s, FNSS Pars and other whatnot."
 nsb_apc_1: "Armament Upgrade"
 nsb_apc_1_desc: "Why mount a .50 machine gun onto a truck, when you could mount a 25mm autocannon there?"
 nsb_apc_2: "Increased Armor"
 nsb_apc_2_desc: "So far, our 'APCs' were just armored cars but made out of trucks and microbuses. In order to fully differentiate them from our AC designs and to increase their usefulness, we should outfit our armored personnel carriers with heavier, bulkier armor. That way, they'll allow for safer transportation of infantrymen."
 nsb_apc_3: "Improved Infantry Protection"
 nsb_apc_3_desc: "It takes more to protect a vehicle and its crew from bullets than to just cover it with layers of steel as thick as possible and call it a day. The armor needs to have the right shape and thickness not to dampen the vehicles's speed and to shield its crew from damage."
 nsb_apc_4: "Improved Mobility"

 nsb_truck_2_desc: "Our motorized and logistic soldiers' equipment lacks ANY forms of standardization and there's at least a hundred different models of vehicles and modification methods that we're currently using. However, as we use them, we start to notice which types of vehicles and mods are the most effective; Jeep-like cars are simultaneously nimble and agile whilst still having a high capacity, thus we should mod our trucks into improvised jeeps, humvees and MRAPs to make it easier for our motorized troops to get our of bad situations and to dodge incoming artillery barrages."

 light_artillery_upgrade1_desc: "Fighting a war is a team effort. If we are to win, we need to ensure that all parts of the machine (as in - all sectors of our army) work in tandem with each other. An all-infantry army will have a hard time defending and pushing the frontline forward, and a mortar crews left by itself won't do too much. Ergo, we have to teach our infantry and artillerymen to synchronize and help each other out, so that they're able to successfully accomplish their goals in the battle."

 heavy_artillery_upgrade2: "Partial Standardization"
 heavy_artillery_upgrade2_desc: "To make mass production and in-the-field usage of ammunition easier, we should at least partially standardize our artillery pieces, either by producing copies of a few specific models, or by adapting different artillery pieces to the same callibers."

 anti_air_upgrade: "Aiming Ahead Of Targets"
 anti_air_upgrade_desc: "If we have to resort to using machine guns against planes like its WW1, then we have to learn how to efficiently operate them - by teaching our AA gun operators how to accurately predict their bullets' trajectories and how the enemy planes will try to dodge their fire, we allow ourselves to rely on simple machine guns for defense against enemy air fleets, at least until they start to include actual war aircraft in them."

 self_propelled_artillery_upgrade_desc: "Huh... Turns out cars with makeshift cannons slapped on top of them make for fast, but otherwise utterly and absolutely poor weapons. If we are to use cars as the chassis for our self-propelled artillery guns, then we have to prepare them for military use first, essentially turning them into lightly-armored armored cars with open turrets armed with lighter, less makeshift artillery pieces."

 self_propelled_artillery_upgrade1_desc: "We can improve the effectiveness of our artillery truck operators and prepare them for the day when they'll get to sit behind the wheel of an actual moving artillery piece by teaching them that real SPG combat is, sadly, not about performing daredevil drive-bys with a big, mounted fuck-off cannon."
 self_propelled_artillery_upgrade3: "The Krab's Legacy"
 self_propelled_artillery_upgrade3_desc: "Krabs have made many headlines in 2022, when they've helped the Ukrainian army drive the Russians back. Their success and the reputation they've earned amongst the Russian invaders has been a source of pride and hope for Poles interested in their own army, who saw that, perhaps, the Polish military still has some aces in their hand. \nOur army boys, longing for at least a small crumb of glory for Poland, hope to recreate the Krab's success.
