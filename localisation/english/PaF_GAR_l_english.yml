unification.108.t: "[GetNewspaper]Republic of Garwolin unifies Capital Region!"
unification.108.desc: "Following brutal fighting within Warsaw and its outskirts, President-Elect Radosław Fogiel has reaffirmed his control over Poland’s beating heart. Though not recognized as legitimate by the international community, Fogiel carried himself with all the dignities of his role, delivering a speech before the Presidential Palace, promising wide-sweeping efforts to rebuild and modernize the parts of Warsaw damaged by the years of streetfights, with assurances of a more measured approach to governance and a less heavy-handed approach than his former hardliner allies. Despite foreign observers’ initial fears over the President finally taking his place in Warsaw, Fogiel’s ambitions could reform PiS into a party more approachable to all sides of the political spectrum. Calls for more liberties being provided to groups oppressed under PiS’ Pre-Fall rule have thus far been sidelined, with the President assuring the Press that the matters would be further discussed when Poland is in a state where democratic processes can resume."
