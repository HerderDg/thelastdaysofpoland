unification.108.desc: "Today, we’re bringing you a report from deep in the heartland of Poland: \n\nThe regions surrounding the city of Radom, once part of the Mazovian Voivodeship, have been recently consolidated under Law and Justice rule. Led by Radosław Fogiel, the former charismatic Spokesman for PiS, Garwolin has seen a great deal of stability as well as an organized reconstruction effort across the board following the Fall. Fogiel, in a TV broadcast, proclaimed his wishes of unifying Poland under a reformed PiS, that will never let the nation fall into a state of anarchy again. The state agenda for the foreseeable future however, consists mainly of taking a breath of fresh air and rebuilding what infrastructure was destroyed in the region during its struggles for unification."
