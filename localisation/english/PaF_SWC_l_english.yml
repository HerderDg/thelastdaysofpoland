SWC_wolnosc: "Uncompromising Liberty"
SWC_wolnosc_desc: "The people of Świecie cry out for freedom. The defeated remnants of the Northern Army Group may have thought that they could exploit our city to continue their already lost war, but we have given them a firm piece of our mind. We will not idly submit to the will of an unelected junta. We will not let our rights be trampled. We will not be taxed without any representation. The torch of liberty has been lit, and it will never again be extinguished by half-measures and empty promises. If any fool wishes to subjugate this city, he will learn the hard way that it comes with a price. As long as we stand, Świecie will remain free!"

SWC_wisla: "The Vistulan Redoubt"
SWC_wisla_desc: "We've dealt a devastating blow to the Command's lackeys. Thanks to our first strike, we maintain a complete chokehold on the left bank of the Vistula, cutting the garrison off from all incoming supplies. We have the clear upper hand, and if we maintain our offensive, they will never have enough breathing room to reorganize. With each passing day, we inch ever closer to victory. As long as we keep the enemy's main forces at a distance, the balance of power remains in our favor. We must hold the river at all costs. If we allow the Command to gain even a foothold on the other side, the war will inevitably be lost."
