unification.94.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Teutonic Order unifies Warmia and Masuria!"
unification.94.desc:0 "It seems history has repeated itself as the newly self-proclaimed "Teutonic Order" was established in the lands of Warmia-Masuria during their anti-heretical rampage.\nThe mysterious "Hochmajster" of the Order claimed that the state is a direct continuation of the "Holy Teutonic Mission" which was interrupted, as the Hochmeister claims "By Polish degenerates that stabbed the Catholic Church in the back".\n\nThe state has no recognition of its mission as nearly every neighboring faction of the Polish anarchy has called out their claims as outrageous and utterly devoid of any sense and logic.\n\nDespite the Teutons' allegiance to both German ultranationalism and Catholic extremism, both the German Eurostaat and the Vatican have denounced their efforts as "neo-fascist" and an "affront to God".\n\nEven with their grand appearance very little is known about the insides of the Teutonic society, so the state's continued chances of survival remain at question."
