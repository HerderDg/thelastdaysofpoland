POLITICS_HOCHMAJSTER_DESC: "Catholicism, a religion and force that accompanied Polish national consciousness since its very founding, it would be hard to deny that Roman Christianity became one of the pillars of Polish society over the centuries. \nWhich might at least somewhat explain the Hochmajster's rise to power, an otherwise ridiculous event. \n\nNot much is known about the Hochmajster - he mysteriously appeared during the fall of the Polish state and within weeks garnered the support of local Catholic extremists which he fashioned into a military force resembling the old Teutonic Order. \nMuch is speculated on the Hochmajster's past and identity, is he a German agent sent to subjugate Poland under the guise of a Catholic order? Is he an agent of chaos who truly believes that imitating the medieval rivals of Poland is the clearest path for the country's future? Or is he just an insane larper who managed to carve out a state for himself after the collapse of order? Almost all theories end up being nothing more than baseless claims made in the face of a lack of any known information about the Order's Master and his followers in arms are zealous enough to keep his wishes for secrecy absolute."

unification.94.desc: "The entirety of Poland watches in disbelief as an organization claiming to continue the mission of the Teutonic Order has succeeded in its struggle to establish a state in the lands of Warmia-Masuria. The 'Tełtonisze Ordensztat,' led by a leader identified only as 'Der Hochmajster' seemed nothing more than a decrepit laughing stock, described in some cases as 'a product of insanity' only a few months ago, yet by either some divine stroke of luck or by fate's sick sense of comedy, the Order has managed to beat and conquer every other power in the region - including pushing back the Russian remnants in Kaliningrad. \nDespite the state's adherence to German ultranationalism and Catholic extremism, both the German Eurostaat and the Vatican have condemned the Order's existence as 'absurd' and 'a mockery of Catholicism'.\nNot many people expect the Order to survive for long, but fate has seen greater absurdity before."

unificationreg.94.desc: "Der Tełtoniszes Folksarme stands triumphant over Projsen. Der Hochmajster has personally thanked his best Knights during a Mass in Kwidzyn Katedralkirśe, celebrated by Him. In a lengthy speech He mused about the country's past, blaming the Fall on numerous sabotages from within, committed against the benevolent rulers of old Poland who only cared about the country's best interests. And he promises to right the wrongs they committed, one head at a time. "

unificationsupreg.94.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Ugly, yet Small Truth"
unificationsupreg.94.desc: "Half of Old Poland belongs to the Knights. The Holy Flag flies high over all of Ostpolen, from Malbork all the way to Rzeszów.\nThe celebrations began as usual, with a Mass in Kwidzyn Katedralkirśe celebrated by Der Hochmajster himself. As during previous celebrations, a speech was to take place straight after the Mass. \nDer Hochmajster stood proud in front of the altar. In front of him, in the first row sat his best Knights, their armour gleaming in dim candlelight. Some of them were with Him since the dark beginnings of the Fall, when the first states were established. \nAnd as everyone waited for him to begin, he slowly, without a single word, removed his chainmail gloves and grabbed his helmet. A wave of gasps and murmurs broke the silence as he took the metal protection off, revealing his face for the first time. \nThe noises turned louder, some more fearful and others filled with hope not heard before, as the maskless Hochmajster walked down the steps leading to the altar. How have they been so blind? How has His voice, that felt so familiar, yet so foreign, not betrayed Him earlier? How did He manage to conceal His identity for so long without anyone finding out the reality?\nIt was pointless to think about it now. \n"Majnen brudern und szwestern." He finally spoke, his husky voice resonating from the ancient walls of the Cathedral. "Ojer sig ist szliszen. Iś bin wider da. Sztark und berajt."\nThe crowd listened closely as Jarosław Kaczyński spoke for the first time in many, many years. \n"Bist du baj mir, majner towarzyszen?" \nAnd the crowd stood up, erupting in euphoric ecstasy, saluting their old Master with all their might. "
