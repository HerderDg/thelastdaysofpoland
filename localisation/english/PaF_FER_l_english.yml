unification.27.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Ślonsko Ferajna unifies Upper Silesia!"
unification.27.desc:0 "Not all those who call themselves Silesians think of Poles as the same nation. There are also those who regard Poland as an oppressive occupier who has eradicated the Silesian language and culture for years. The most radical voices found an outlet in the Ślunska Ferajna faction (which could be translated as the Silesian Association).\n\nThe division into hanys (Silesians) and gorols (non-Silesians) became for them an obsessive border of division of society. And in a truly Silesian state, there was no place for racially impure people. Although it has nothing to do with race, displacements and even murders are now happening in the Silesian metropolis, while militias go from house to house measuring the level of Silesianness in every citizen who remained in the territory of Upper Silesia. We can only be afraid of one thing - this level may turn out to be too low for too many inhabitants."
