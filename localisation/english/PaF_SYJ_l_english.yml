unification.51.t: "[GetNewspaper]New Zion unifies Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.51.desc: "Truly bizarre news emerge from Greater Poland, perhaps the greatest proof that Poland has lost its sanity. A fringe religious movement, at least nominally following the Christian faith; outside observers have described the so-called \"New Zion\" as a dangerous cult and a disaster just waiting to happen. Adherent to a near-incomprehensible mess of beliefs, often directly contradictory to official dogma, the state is held together by one thing only - the presence of their supposed prophet - Jarosław Lichwała. Each day new theories spew from his mouth, denouncing the fundamental laws of the known world. Amassing a fanatical following heeding his every word, it took only a single word for them to throw themselves into combat. They fought like a horde, a force unbothered by morale. Unable to push back the unstoppable mass of bodies, warlords fell one by one, with the prophet eventually in full control of the region. Only an outside force can save Greater Poland now."
unification.51.a: "A new messiah, just as crazy as this land"

super.51.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.51.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.51.a: "United at last."
