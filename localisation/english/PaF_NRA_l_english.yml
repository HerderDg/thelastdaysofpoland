unification.122.t: "[GetNewspaper]People's Guard unifies Holy Cross!"
unification.122.desc: "The fall of Poland was an event that radicalized many within the country, turning previously unviable movements into forces in their own right. While most turned to ideas such as Postpolonism, the destruction that the right-wing government of PiS brought to the country allowed many leftist militias to form as well. And one of them ended up filling the power vacuum that was the collapse of Ziobro’s regime. Red flags now fly all over the Holy Cross voivodeship as the People’s Guard consolidates their grip on the region. Adherent to a Soviet-style form of communist thought and striving to rehabilitate the images of the leaders of the old Polish People’s Republic, the state finds itself at odds with the beliefs of the common folk. But who will complain with the barrel of a gun ready to strike down any who dissents?"
unification.122.a: "For Bierut! For Stalin! For a red Poland!"

super.122.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.122.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.122.a: "United at last."
