 NRA_fervor1: "Revolutionary Fervor"
 NRA_fervor1_desc: "PLACEHOLDER - (Rzeczy na przyszłość) Rewolucja musi być szybka, totalna, dłonio-odcinalna. Ziobro musi być wygoniony jak najdalej, a czerwona flaga musi zawisnąć nad Ratuszem w Kielcach. Efekty się polepszają im radykalniej podchodzi się do sytuacji, ale za dużo powoduje, że Gwardia załamuje się pod samą sobą. Za mało powoduje minusy i debuffy."

unification.122.t: "[GetNewspaper]People's Guard unifies Holy Cross!"
unification.122.desc: "The fall of Poland was an event that radicalized many within the country, turning previously unviable movements into forces in their own right. While most turned to ideas such as Postpolonism, the destruction that the right-wing government of PiS brought to the country allowed many leftist militias to form as well. And one of them ended up filling the power vacuum that was the collapse of Ziobro’s regime. Red flags now fly all over the Holy Cross voivodeship as the People’s Guard consolidates their grip on the region. Adherent to a Soviet-style form of communist thought and striving to rehabilitate the images of the leaders of the old Polish People’s Republic, the state finds itself at odds with the beliefs of the common folk. But who will complain with the barrel of a gun ready to strike down any who dissents?"
unification.122.a: "For Bierut! For Stalin! For a red Poland!"
