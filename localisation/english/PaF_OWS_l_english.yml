unification.84.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]WOŚP unifies Pomerelia!"
unification.84.desc:0 "Of all the contenders vying for control of Pomerelia, perhaps none was as unlikely to win as Jerzy Owsiak. However, it seems that popularity can truly get you far, as the leader’s long history of charitable work and a relatively clean record, further helped by the decision not to cooperate with the occupation authorities proved to be the recipe for success. Formed primarily as a populist front and refuge for the politically disaffected, the state of the Grand Orchestra represents a continuation of Owsiak’s work. A loose organization lacking many proper institutions of governance, a monumental challenge lies ahead to establish itself as a respectable state able to provide for its citizens and not merely a stopgap for a more powerful warlord on their path of conquest. The people of Pomerelia can only hope for their success or else the rights they now enjoy may forever disappear."
unification.84.a:0 "To serve the people of Poland forever and one day longer"
