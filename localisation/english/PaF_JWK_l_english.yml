unification.20.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]JWK Lubliniec unites Zagłębie and Jura"
unification.20.desc:0 "News from the Zagłębie and Jura region: Military Commando Unit from Lubliniec town has dominated this territory. It's one of the largest military base specializing in elite troops, who came together with units of Territorial Defense Forces(WOT)- numerous, though inexperienced volunteers. Together, they managed to defeat local warlords and establish a reign of military administration.\n\n General staff manage the entire jointed army, but tensions rise regularly. Volunteers from WOT more and more boldly ignore orders of commando officers, which leads to quarrels even at the highest levels. And the general-leader himself apparently has been spending much time in the library reading ancient strategists, rumors says. It is not known whether an army with the state will be able to survive, especially with such chaos in the structures of power. However, their military strength and combat experience should not be underestimated."
