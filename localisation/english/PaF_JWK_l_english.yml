unification.20.t: "[GetNewspaper]JWK Lubliniec unites Zagłębie and Jura"
unification.20.desc: "Fresh news from Zagłębie and Jura: The Military Commando Unit based in the town of Lubliniec has managed to dominate the entire region. Using the combined military might of the Commandos and the Territorial Defense Forces, a large yet inexperienced fighting force, they managed to restore order under a military administration. The general staff managed to wrangle the mess of a fighting force, though tensions between them were largely strained, with commandos and territorials often disregarding orders from their higherups’ counterparts, often leading to clashes between the two. Rumors also state that the General-Leader himself has been spending more and more time at libraries researching ancient strategies. Time will tell if this army with a state has a chance at survival, factoring in the deepening conflicts within power structures. Fractured as it may, JWK’s sheer firepower cannot be underestimated."
unification.20.a: "JWK marches on."

super.20.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.20.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.20.a: "United at last."
