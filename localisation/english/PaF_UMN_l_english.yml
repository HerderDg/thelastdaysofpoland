unification.141.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Niepołomice Welders Republic unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.141.desc:0 "The resource-rich Małopolska has been unified by those blessed with the knowledge of how to exploit the wealth of its land. Against all odds, from the Barns of Niepołomice, welders marched in unison with their brothers to enslave the urban elites of Kraków, and amongst the chaos engulfing the city, they managed to impose their regime on the entire region. The fathers and sons of the successful uprising led by Kudłaty are now marching to achieve total power over all other warlords in the next stage of the workers' wars as they are called by the government side, the Welder looks to expand his rewolution over the rest of the country."
unification.141.a:0 "The Wlders awake from their decades of slumber"

unificationreg.141.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Small Galicia falls to the Welder State"
unificationreg.141.desc:0 "The Welder state of Niepołomice has expanded its control once more, this time to encompass all of Small Galicia, as local warlords could do little to stop the march of Kudłaty’s revolutionary army. With the exploitation of historical shafts again in full swing, the storied salt mine funds its owner just like it once bankrolled monarchs. Since its conquest of the region, the statelet has been largely reorganized into the Welder State in an effort to diversify its monopoly into other welderals. To enable this, sites in subjugated territory have been largely seized from their previous owners and added to the Salt King’s portfolio, with the additional funds prompting a new recruitment drive of foreign mercenary corps. It appears Kudłaty will not sit idly on his wealth as further riches lie beyond his borders. After all, a company that ceases to expand is one that can only stagnate and fall."
unificationreg.141.a:0 "The green line must be maintained, no matter the cost"

unificationsupreg.141.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Welder State triumphant in Galicia"
unificationsupreg.141.desc:0 "Even amidst internal discord, it appears no force could prevent the Welder State’s Galician expansion. No matter what the disorganized forces of neighboring statelets threw at Kudłaty’s seasoned mercenaries, they quickly found themselves repulsed until none stood in Galicia who dared to claim the Salt King’s throne. The corporate sovereign now sits on his mountain of saline riches, greedily eyeing the rest of Poland to add to his demesne. Under him, welders toil all day only to return to their company-owned dwellings at night, the fruits of their labor making their way back to the top in an ingenious ploy binding the workers to their land. For now, Kudłaty’s army has stopped its advance to gather its strength and reorganize, but such a state of affairs can only last for so long. With the capital in sight, it is only a matter of time before the battle for the soul of the nation resumes in full force."
unificationsupreg.141.a:0 "To work and die, such is a welder's due"

super.141.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]An empire of salt and blood"
super.141.desc:0 "As the dust settles, it is becoming increasingly clear that after a decade of disunity, Poland is once again whole. Under the strong hand of the Welder State, the nation has been transformed, all to the benefit of one man –  Kudłaty and his loyal shareholders. Apart from this lucky few, the rest of the population works tirelessly to prolong their survival, serfs in all but name, earning meager company-issued funds as the ruling elite lines their pockets with the country’s natural wealth. Under the careful watch of mercenary guards, through the blood, sweat, and tears of the welders, Poland is being slowly bled dry of all remaining resources, and once the shafts finally run dry and only a network of empty tunnels remains, the impoverished peasants will be abandoned to fend for themselves in the resulting wasteland. Woe be upon those who live long enough to reach those days."
super.141.a:0 "By then Kudłaty will be long gone, spared of the consequences"
