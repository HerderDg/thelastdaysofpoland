POLITICS_RED_RABBI_DESC:0 "Red Rabbi (born 2000) - before the fall he was a regular fan of Widzew club, enjoying life of a typical football hooligan. In his youth he dutifully served as an altar boy in local parish. During his service he learned in great detail about the content of the Holy Scripture, both Old and New Testament. Because of this knowledge, he was chosen as a representative of the Widzew fans during the first contact with the Jews during the Great ŁKS Persecution. He ensured peaceful cooperation between two groups and after the defeat of ŁKS was one of the first to convert to Judaism, after being swayed by the theological arguments of Jewish scholars."
POLITICS_JERZY_URBAN_DESC:0 "Jerzy Urban (born 3 August 1933) - Polish journalist, satirist and a politician of Jewish descent. Born during the turbulent times for Jews in Poland, he had to hide with his family and didn't receive proper education until the end of the Second World War, although he has never graduated any University. Despite those obstacles, he quickly began to write for state-controled newspapers often harshly criticising government's policies. Eventually, he became a spokesperson for the communist goverment in 1981. Being resposible for the propaganda during the infamous rule of general Jaruzelski, he became known as the "Goebbels of the Martial Law era". After the fall of communism, he became a member of polish social democratic paries (SdRP and SLD), famous internet personality popular among the youth and an exchange trader, becoming the 98th most wealthy Pole in 2004. An experienced propagandist and political intriguer, he managed to survive in the third collapse of Polish state, that happened during his timeline. After the political situation in Łódź had calirfied, he was invited to create a government by the Hooligans of Widzew, who were desparate to find competent Jews for their ruling structure."
