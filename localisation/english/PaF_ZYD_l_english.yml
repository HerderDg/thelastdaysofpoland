POLITICS_RED_RABBI_DESC:0 "Red Rabbi (born 2000) - before the fall he was a regular fan of Widzew club, enjoying life of a typical football hooligan. In his youth he dutifully served as an altar boy in local parish. During his service he learned in great detail about the content of the Holy Scripture, both Old and New Testament. Because of this knowledge, he was chosen as a representative of the Widzew fans during the first contact with the Jews during the Great ŁKS Persecution. He ensured peaceful cooperation between two groups and after the defeat of ŁKS was one of the first to convert to Judaism, after being swayed by the theological arguments of Jewish scholars."
POLITICS_JERZY_URBAN_DESC:0 "Jerzy Urban (born 3 August 1933) - Polish journalist, satirist and a politician of Jewish descent. Born during the turbulent times for Jews in Poland, he had to hide with his family and didn't receive proper education until the end of the Second World War, although he has never graduated any University. Despite those obstacles, he quickly began to write for state-controled newspapers often harshly criticising government's policies. Eventually, he became a spokesperson for the communist goverment in 1981. Being resposible for the propaganda during the infamous rule of general Jaruzelski, he became known as the "Goebbels of the Martial Law era". After the fall of communism, he became a member of polish social democratic paries (SdRP and SLD), famous internet personality popular among the youth and an exchange trader, becoming the 98th most wealthy Pole in 2004. An experienced propagandist and political intriguer, he managed to survive in the third collapse of Polish state, that happened during his timeline. After the political situation in Łódź had calirfied, he was invited to create a government by the Hooligans of Widzew, who were desparate to find competent Jews for their ruling structure."

ZYD_leviticus_desc:0 "Rabbi, together with his tribe, set off to the south, to Tomaszów, called the Nettle Town, because in its strict center you had to be very careful around them. There, too, also went with him arrivals of the original Chosen People. Second Arrivals told stories about how the town was famous for its wealth ages ago, when a textile factory was still operating there, famous throughout Polin for its skillful craftsmanship. Dollar Leviathan put an end to this along with the reforms which consumed all the wealth from this land."

Or every other thing, that suckers give you"
ZYD_constant_brawls:0 "Constant Brawls"
ZYD_constant_brawls_desc:0 "It would be a euphemism to say that our lands are boiling with unrest. Widzewians are wandering between communes and places where suckers are mugged, they start fights (often with fatal casualties), they plunder everything that is not attached to the ground. Meanwhile, in the woods lurk the ŁKS militias who came here banished from Łódź by the Lord of Dialogue. Lonely wanderers often die without a trace. No one is sure of their future, and conflict grows between First and Second Arrivals as to how to overcome the crisis."
ZYD_mutual_destruction:0 "Mutual Destruction"
ZYD_mutual_destruction_desc:0 "There is a constant struggle for resources between the Twelve Tribes. With each passing day, the idea of unity between Chosen People and Club is fading away. Instead, the most mundane and primitive particularisms come to the fore. If we do not stop this process and remind the Widzewians who they are, what their tasks and enemies are, soon the entire New Canaan will plunge into the chaos of civil war."
ZYD_the_decalogue_upgrade:0 "Improvement of the Decalogue"
ZYD_the_decalogue_upgrade_desc:0 "Yahweh Himself has visited our most pious men tonight in a dream. They claim that He ordered them to amend the Decalogue immediately and to extend it significantly. After a short analysis, it can be seen that the proposed changes will seriously increase the rigor to which the Widzew will be subjected. There is also an emphasis on obedience to Yahweh, Elders, Prophets of Faith and Rabbi. The Second Arrivals are protesting against the appropriation of secular law competences by religious law. However, it cannot be denied that such an extensive Decalogue as the legal basis of our state can become a guarantee of peace, unity and unanimity amongst the Chosen People."
ZYD_limitation_of_the_autonomy_of_the_twelve_tribes:0 "Limiting the Autonomy of the Twelve Tribes"
ZYD_limitation_of_the_autonomy_of_the_twelve_tribes_desc:0 "While it cannot be disagreed that the system of division between the twelve tribes of the twelve streets of Widzew, thanks to its "flexibility", made it possible to create our framework for the new Polin, now it is only a ball and chain. Hooligan Communes of Widzew, independent of anything, are habitats of moral decay and are the source of endless class antagonisms. A functioning state cannot be built on this basis. While we can ... respect the distinctiveness of individual tribes in the cultural sense of the word, their legal independence from the central government must be abolished."

ZYD_warriors_overview_desc:0 "Although it is a shame to admit it, The Club, despite the revival of fervor among fans, continues to scrub the bottom - most of the communal teams can handle our theoretically best players. How are we to maintain the enthusiasm of the Twelve Tribes if their most important representation, the source of the highest inspiration, are not able to score a goal playing against a team of perpetually drunk idlers? Anyway, frankly speaking, it would be difficult to distinguish them anyway... We have to find players who, with the deadly effectiveness of their game and its emotional style, will inspire our soldiers to fight in the name of the Chosen Club, the Chosen People and God Almighty."
ZYD_eleven_felash:0 "Eleven of Falashas"
ZYD_eleven_felash_desc:0 "First Arrivals, seeing the problems with the first rank of Yahweh's warriors, suggested to us the idea of bringing black players of the Mosaic faith. Of course, these talented players won't come to us for free, but it's a game worth the effort. In addition to having a real dream team, thanks to them, we will emphasize the religious unity of the Chosen People and encourage our foreign brothers to support the effort to release the Philistines and Ammonites from other clubs. ŁKS had insulted us and Yahweh with their crooked mugs long enough."
ZYD_eleven_sons_of_labour:0 "Eleven of Working People"
ZYD_eleven_sons_of_labour_desc:0 "Second Arrivals suggested that we respect those who put the most effort into building the state, that is, the workers. Although the appointment of suckers to the RTS eleven may come as a kind of shock to members of the Twelve Tribes, and it is likely that there will be anxiety about it. However, Second Arrivals, along with the Kibic, will emphasize that it will improve our opinion among the losers themselves and thus increase the efficiency of their work. When asked about the possible football abilities of this team, Kibic replied that he would personally ensure that each match ended with our victory - he replied that he could afford it, and in "NIE" he would describe everything as it should be."

Their members live in communes with a few hundred members where they drink beer, watch games and beat the shit out of each other. Of course, they do not work and collect funds from suckers, that is, those who have employment. In theory, it was supposed to allow them to learn hand-to-hand combat, study Torah and pray for the Club and the Nation. This system can no longer be maintained - our army is a drunken, parasitic mob who can neither hold a bat straight nor quote even a half-line of the Book of Numbers. They don't know how or what to fight for. In addition, they consume a huge amount of goods that no one is able to control"
ZYD_wrath_of_the_losers:0 "Wrath of the Losers"
ZYD_wrath_of_the_losers_desc:0 "In addition to the priest-leadership caste and Widzew fans, the third social group in our country are suckers (losers) - working people and targets of muggings and beatings. While at the beginning we managed to keep them in check, now strikes and unrest are increasing mainly due to the growing greed of the Warriors of Israel. Of course, this has a terrible effect on our industrial production. We can't beat the pagans or ŁKS with slingshots and broken baseball bats. We have to do something about it."
ZYD_the_kibbutz_reform:0 "The Kibbutz Reform"
ZYD_the_kibbutz_reform_desc:0 "First Arrivals claim that they have found a solution to our economic problems. They propose to transform hooligan communes into kibbutzim. Under a certain religious regime, our warriors would begin to cultivate the land and initially perform simple craftsmanship. That way, we would give them a tangible job, increase production, and we could calm the mood among suckers. Engrossed in work and prayer, hooligans will not have time or will to mug. However, it will be difficult to force them to do so, most of them do not have a trade in their hands, let alone in their legs and heads. Religious and vocational education will take a while."
ZYD_sending_widzewiaks_to_factories:0 "Sending Widzewians to the Factories"
ZYD_sending_widzewiaks_to_factories_desc:0 "Second Arrivals believe that the best solution would be the actual or partial liquidation of the communes and sending the Widzewians to factories as workers and "informal guards". A few nice words, a short "political and religious" training and there will be peace among the losers and the Widzew will finally serve us for something. Kibic took on the organization of this venture and its "ideological and media foundation". It won't take long, and the results can be… exceptionally fruitful."

ZYD_discuss_of_the_high_command_desc:0 "By making the necessary economic reforms and restraining the desires of our brothers, we can begin to think about taking over the entire voivodeship and most importantly - returning to our True, Original Canaan - Łódź. On the way to the War for the Fatherland and our return there stands only ŁKS' Sons and Daughters of Corinth. They are godless Jebusites who graduated from Pabianice, who let gingers pass forward in queues. Savages who lick plates after rolls and confuse Reksio with Krecik. Our warriors often do not know how to fight, they think that baseball bats are used for the game. We have to choose leaders who will teach them the art of war and lead them against the Plague of Śródmieście."
ZYD_rabbis_as_commanders:0 "Command in the Hands of Rabbis-Trainers"
ZYD_rabbis_as_commanders_desc:0 "The key to success is always the right morale and support from the very top. The rabbis have already proved that they are able to motivate the Widzewians to act: their initiatives have re-ignited the fire of faith among the Chosen People. Each day's fiery sermons and imaginative parables teach us about the power of the Renewed Covenant and those who are not worthy of it. After the speeches there is a period of intense physical training during which psalms are sung. Giving the command to the rabbis seems obvious - the Twelve Tribes would enter with them even into the burning Sodom"
ZYD_good_old_comrades:0 "Good Ol' Comrades"
ZYD_good_old_comrades_desc:0 "Though Yahweh has shown us His grace in renewing the Covenant, it would be arrogant to demand his support at all times. We have to build our army on solid foundations, and religious raptures are not such. Though many have died, there are still among us old officers from the time when the Polin army fought under the Red Banner and under the divine auspices. Their knowledge and their children will be the head of our new army. Regular, professional training, political and religious training, the watchful eye of secret comrades and the conscription wave will remake the Widzew into a force against which our enemies will tremble."
ZYD_sanctioning_the_kibbutz_cult_of_strength:0 "Sanctioning the Hooligan's Cult of Strength"
ZYD_sanctioning_the_kibbutz_cult_of_strength_desc:0 "Among Widzewians, adoration of strength, brutality and domination is widespread. For the sake of fame, power over other people and to prove their power, they are able to do things that no one else would dare to do. They are second to none in their bravado on the battlefield. Some radical rabbis feel that they are subconsciously proud of their covenant with Yahweh, of the grace He has bestowed on them. Rabbis also claim that this element of Hooligans culture should be exposed and sanctified. For He Who Is, chose Us to make all suckers tremble before us."
ZYD_davids_army:0 "David's Mighty Warriors"
ZYD_davids_army_desc:0 "Twelve Tribes are becoming more and more like the ancient tribes of the first Homeland. They wear steel breastplates made of scrap metal, they make shields from it, which they polish in such a way that the sunlight reflecting on them blinds their enemies. They excel in the use of slingshots and captured rifles. All this takes place under the supervision of rabbis, to the sounds of songs written by King David, to the light of the menorah and the sounds of Widzew football matches. Even our starting eleven put on sandals and tunics with the logo of the Chosen Club and the Star of David. Today we are like our Second King - inconspicuous, but ready to defeat any Goliath that stands in our way. We too are ready to restore the lost glory to the Chosen People. It is our duty."
ZYD_recreation_of_wzw:0 "Recreation of Internal Military Service"
ZYD_recreation_of_wzw_desc:0 "Our old but new People's Army must be reliable. It is best for professionals to take care of it. Religious madness rabbis cannot guarantee this. There used to be a certain organisation, which exemplary controlled our armed forces, protecting them against subversive ideas and taking care of the appropriate ideological reinforcement. We have to reconstruct the Internal Military Service to keep our Army clean. Staff will be composed of the most intelligent and obedients Widzewians, trained by the still alive ex-officers of this formation. They will also make an excellent foundation for our Intelligence and Counterintelligence"

Former, uncouth hooligans, thinking only about drinking beer and beating suck...working masses of towns and villages, today they march in steady pace, dressed in singular patterned uniforms, singing The International at the same time. All this under the watchfull eye of intelligence officers from the WSW and certaing ideological-religious commissars. As Kibic writes in 'NIE' - "No one has any doubts anymore - PŻPR has again the strength an means to restore order in the brown Polish wilderness. Polish-Jewish Hooligan-Workers Army awaits orders to deal with the National-Philistine revolution. Their first targets will be antisemitic bandits and worker exploiters from ŁKS"

It cannot fit any more donations. Everyone makes up our joint effort. Anyone capable of wielding a combat baseball bat will ready to fulfill his duty promised to Yahweh, his People and the Club. Footballers are also traveling from city to city, from commune to commune, village to village encouraging for intensified effort. Meanwhile, woods are silent as a grave. They smell of fear.

ZYD_forced_converions_desc:0 "The rabbis put forward an interesting proposal regarding our approach to ŁKS. They recalled the existence of the Samaritan people in the ancient times of Israel. They were Jews not included in the Covenant - converts from other faiths. They served as guest workers and legwork men, which was unworthy for any member of the Chosen People. Nothing stands in the way of renewing the existence of Samaritans in our modern conditions. Captured ŁKS hooligans will be forced to recognise power of Yahweh, if they ever want to be free again. So also our legitimate authority."
ZYD_forced_labor:0 "Forced Labor"
ZYD_forced_labor_desc:0 "It is known that we have to deal with ŁKS. These polish fascists can no longer be free people, and especially free to rob our comrade workers mercilessly. But why should we waste their potential? Many of them will not stand the pressure and they will fall into our hands. And those who don't work - they don't eat. You can always work in various ways; cut the forest, dig peat. Sometimes it is even possible to achieve something after a sufficiently long "internship". Let it be freedom. Of course, "freedom" under strict supervision of the WSW. After all, we are talking about politically and religiously uncertain element."

ZYD_taking_the_dogs_off_the_leash_desc:0 "Flame of faith awakened in the hearts of admirers of the Chosen Club is like the one that burns in the bowels of Leviathan. It will consume everything that stands in its way. It will only leave ashes to fertilize the land for the sucker plowmen to cultivate. Indeed, terrible is th wrath of the Twelve Tribes; a threat from their lips would be fatal for the hearts of weak people - it would render them still. There is no hope for enemies of the sons of Israel, descendants of David and Solomon, grandsons of Moses. Canaan will be drenched in blood, both Old and New. This shall be our sacrifice, the true lamb of God."

ZYD_zomo_action_desc:0 "Who is better prepared to fight the scourge of anti-Zionist banditry than specially trained, motorized emergency forces? Even groups of bandits most strongly bound by class-national hatred will lose in a direct clash with the disciplined force of the working class, which in addition has a technological superiority. Lublin and T4 reserves we have are enough to create a special brigade, our pride and terror for the enemy. Both external and internal."
ZYD_rts_is_a_power:0 "RTS IS POWERFUL!"
ZYD_rts_is_a_power_desc:0 "Chosen People are one once again. Nobody can math our army. Nobody eats to their heart's content like our brothers and our sisters. Yahweh did not have to give us manna and streams of drinking water. In desert, dangerous and inhospitable, we have bult a real oasis from just the sand. His Word and our unbending will, faith in the victory of the Chosen People and the Club were enough. Rabbi stands today on top of the Tomaszów Chimney and watches how wonderful his Country is all around. But also, he waits for a word from Yahweh..."

zydzew.1.t:0 "Book of Genesis"
zydzew.1.desc:0 "Yahweh looked at Canaan of the North and said:\n- "Great are the crimes of the nation with whom I once estabilished a covenant. The dust fell on the old trophies, the last witnesses of the former glory."\n\nYahweh then looked at New Jerusalem and said:\n- "Great is the corruption which has struck the chosen land. Green paper and gold calves are worshiped in my place. Jerusalem became a Sodom. The Israelites of the Widzew family fraternize with the loser Jebusites of the Śródmieście family. My people have forgotten the terms of the covenant. They eat from one bowl, and drink from one can as one, with those who do not know my name. There is not one righteous among them."\n\nThen Yahweh looked at the chiefs of the Widzew house and said:\n- "Where are the rulers of old who praised my name? Where is the Word left pure, free from lies and greed? They sold themselves. There is not one righteous among them."\n\nThen he looked at the warriors of Yahweh.\n- "Great is the weakness of my people. No one of its members is in the front line of Widzew's warriors. And eleven there I see unworthy strangers, eleven enemies of the tribe with whom I made a covenant. In gold they only believe. In gold and nothing more. There is not one righteous among them."\n\nGreat was Yahweh's anger. He said then:\n- “I say: It will be seven days and seven nights before the rain of flames falls on the new Sodom, once called My land. If a righteous man remains there, let him save those who can be saved and go south. Into wilderness. They will save the righteous, and they will suffocate sinners."\n\nRabbi lived then in Lodz, the last faithful servant of Yahweh. The sins of the chosen people did not drown out their faith in the victory of the Chosen Club and the Almighty Lord. For six days and six nights, he walked the streets of Łódź carrying the red flag, the symbol of the Covenant. On the seventh day, he and those who followed him were exiled. Sinners feared their renewed faith. This is how the twelve faithful tribes of Widzew came out of the twelve streets of the corrupted land.\n\nOn the seventh night, fire fell on Łódź, and the sky turned black."

Armed, the Lord's Faithful obtained food from the surrounding towns and villages.\n\nOn the fourteenth day, the Widzew tribes found people dressed in black. Their beards, hair, and noses were long. They were the Original and most faithful servants of Jehovah. They rejoiced greatly when the Rabbi greeted them with matzah and a dressing. Before the relief of his armies, they suffered much from the heathens. They told him many stories about the old days. Together they moved on as one tribe of He Who Is.\n\nOn the twenty-second day, more sons of the Chosen People were found by the twelve tribes on their way. They were clothed in suits, without beards and long noses, but they knew the word of Jehovah, and they were born of the tribe of Israel. And the Rabbi also greeted them with matzah and dressings. Before the relief of his armies, they suffered with wrath from the heathen. They told Rabbi much about the recent history of the People. Together they moved on as one tribe of He Who Is.\n\nYahweh's old and new servants have brought light, long ago overshadowed by corruption. The §BLight of God§! as §RHis People§!, People of §BFaith§! as well as §RWork§!. At that time they agreed and together they purified the twelve tribes of their former harshness.\n\nOn the fortieth day, the Rabbi, carrying a red flag, and a bat stained with blood in his other hand, saw the wilderness. Yahweh then spoke to him, "Behold, the Promised Land." That is also what Rabbi has said unto the people. At that time the tribes scattered, establishing communes where the land was empty for the sons of Yahweh and full of suckers to work. This is how the People of Widzew came to the south."

From the innumerable ruins of the city, they collected bricks and erected a wall around the town. Neither bats nor furious fists could cope with it, because the stones fired from the slings repelled Widzewians, be it during the day or at night. Then the Rabbi summoned Elders to his seat to consult them, what must be done to conquer the fortified city, for the glory and household of the People and the Chosen Club.\n\nFirst Elder, called the Tiger by his listeners, said:\n\n"Rabbi, Yahweh spoke to me in a dream and so ordered that the city should be conquered -\nThe residents of Tomaszów can see the movements of our troops with cameras. I know how to destroy them without the use of a bat or a fist. Sneak to the Great Chimney, i must, which in the heart of the city lies, among the factory that sign of the PZPR bears and send a signal, destroying the monitoring. Then their slingshots at night will be inaccurate, because they will not pierce the darkness with their eyes"\n\nThen the §BFirst Arrivals said:§!\n“- He says the truth, the will of Jehovah speaks through him. In order for him to be able to sneak through, the trumpets must be blown along the entire line of the walls and walk towards it slowly at night. When the stones stop hitting accurately, our charge will sweep the wall away. But our warriors must be strong, only make them train day and night, Rabbi, so that they can break through the wall. We will show them how they should make themselves strong"\n\nThus they did so, capturing the city. When the §RSecond Arrivals§! also entered it, all fighting ceased. Sight of them and their words about the former glory of the city soothed the people of Tomaszów. The anger at the §BFirsts§! was relieved.\n\nRabbi said to his counselors when the city was taken:\n“Your words contained much wisdom, so you shall go and give it to others, so that the Chosen both People and the Club may be strong. And you, Tiger, you shall teach us about the secrets of electronics.”\n\nThus the priests dispersed among the twelve tribes of Widzew, teaching them about the glory of the past and praise the dexterity of arms and legs. And it was a difficult learning, after years of Sodom Darkness and unwritten peace with the Philistines of Łódź Śródmieście.""

They were poor, exhausted by the aversion that befell them on all sides. Among them was a great, aged man, a dove-hearted philanthropist, who took the name of a Kibic in order to come closer to the Chosen Club. He soon founded a newspaper in Tomaszów to praise the work of the Homeland Conquest. Every Widzewian quickly became a faithful reader of the NIE journal - a voice of opposition to persecution and an advocate of Total Reclamation.\n\nThe pages of this journal enumerated the destruction suffered by Polin and how much the Chosen People had lost. Not only during the Fall, but for the past thirty years as well. Thousands of workplaces, hundreds of thousands of prefabricated flats, millions of dollars for privatization. However, Kibic was unwavering when asked about his feelings:\n\n"I don't give a shit," he would reply as he continued to write. He was a great inspiration to the twelve tribes, maintaining a swashbuckling vigor despite his advanced age. He invested profits from the daily in Ford and Toyota through contacts with other members of the Chosen People. In this way, he collected capital and multiplied his potential. However, he did it only as an exception to the success of the case of the Chosen Club.\n\nHowever, in neighboring countries, lies began to be said that the §RRed Goebbels§! had been put to a pedestal again."

To take over the suckers to work and mug, as well as wealth and land. There were too few rabbis-trainers and sometimes they succumbed to the drives of fratricidal fights and encouraged their fellows to do so. At last the Lord visited him in a dream and said to him:\n-“Rabbi, the people with whom I have made a covenant, once again trampling upon his terms. Where has unity gone?"\n\nAnd thus Rabbi replied:\n- “Yahweh the Great, what shall we do when too little of us knows the Word, and even less is able to deliver it? What are we to do when your will has been made known only to a few, the old Covenant has remained only in the soul, not in our minds?"\n\nAnd Yahweh replied:\n-“Let the Covenant be renewed then. I will hand over the law to you, and you will hang it in the area, order a decent mural to be made, and you will not spare any sprays. The word will become the law of the streets again and everyone will know it."\n\nSo Rabbi commanded to do. He also took a flat piece of concrete and sprayed the Law of the Renewed Covenant on it. Then he took it, along with his bat and the red banner with which he led the Tribes out of Łódź, and placed them in Daewoo Lanos. After that, he sealed the car and kept the keys for himself. Four times a year, he travels around the lands of the Twelve Tribes, and it is always a great celebration."
