POLITICS_RED_RABBI_DESC:0 "The Red Rabbi was once a regular fan of Widzew Football Club, enjoying the life of a typical football hooligan, but now serves as a spiritual leader of the clique. In his youth he dutifully served as an altar boy in a local parish. During his service he learned in great detail about the contents of the Holy Scripture, both Old and New Testament. Because of this knowledge, he was chosen as a representative of the Widzew fans during the first contact with the Jews during the Great ŁKS Persecution. He ensured peaceful cooperation between two groups and after the defeat of ŁKS was one of the first to convert to Judaism, after being swayed by the theological arguments of Jewish scholars"
POLITICS_JERZY_URBAN_DESC:0 "A man born during the turbulent times for Jews in Poland forced into hiding along with his family is yet again facing turbulent times, though this time for all his countrymen alike. He didn't receive proper education until the end of the Second World War, even then he has never graduated from any University. Despite those obstacles, he quickly began to write for state-controlled newspapers, often harshly criticizing the government's policies. Eventually, he became a spokesperson for the communist government in 1981. Being responsible for propaganda during the infamous rule of General Jaruzelski, he became known as the "Goebbels of the Martial Law era". After the fall of communism, he became a member of polish social democratic parties (SdRP and SLD), famous internet personality popular among the youth and a successful stock trader, becoming the 98th most wealthy Pole in 2004. An experienced propagandist and political intriguer, he managed to survive in the third collapse of the Polish state. After the political situation in Łódź had clarified, he was invited to create a government with the Hooligans of Widzew, who were desperate to find competent Jews for their ruling structure."

ZYD_exodus:0 "Shemot"
ZYD_exodus_desc:0 "Forty days the Rabbi wandered, leading twelve tribes to the Promised Wilderness. On the fourth day, hunger appeared among the people of Widzew. Only faith in the Word of Yahweh kept them strong. Then the rabbi, seeing this, said:\n\n-Hunger torments us, help your people, Yahweh!"
ZYD_leviticus:0 "Wayiqra"
ZYD_leviticus_desc:0 "The Rabbi, together with his tribe, set off to the south, to Tomaszów, called the Nettle Town, because in its strict center you had to be very careful around them. There, too, also went with him arrivals of the original Chosen People. Second Arrivals told stories about how the town was famous for its wealth ages ago, when a textile factory was still operating there, famous throughout Polin for its skillful craftsmanship. Dollar Leviathan put an end to this along with the reforms which consumed all the wealth from this land."

ZYD_deuteronomy:0 "Devarim"
ZYD_deuteronomy_desc:0 "Decalogue\n\n1. Thou shalt have no other clubs but RTS nor gods but Yahweh\n2. Thou shalt not take the name of thy Club in vain\n3. Remember the match day, to keep it holy, fire flares\n4. Honour thy Club, thy God and thy Rabbi\n5. Thou shalt steal only from suckers and enemies of Thy People and Club\n6. Thou shalt not covet your homie’s girl nor his phone\n7. Thou shall not snitch\n8. Thou shall fuck up thy enemies equally\n9. Thou shall not refuse a beer\n10. Or every other thing, that suckers give you"
ZYD_constant_brawls:0 "Constant Brawls"
ZYD_constant_brawls_desc:0 "It would be an understatement to say that our lands are boiling with unrest. Widzewians wander between communes and places where suckers are mugged, they start fights (often with fatal casualties), they plunder everything that is not bolted down to the ground. Meanwhile, in the woods lurk the ŁKS militias who came here banished from Łódź by the Lord of Dialogue. Lonely wanderers often vanish without a trace. No one is sure of the future, and conflict grows between First and Second Arrivals as to how to overcome the crisis."
ZYD_mutual_destruction:0 "Mutual Destruction"
ZYD_mutual_destruction_desc:0 "There is a constant struggle for resources between the Twelve Tribes. With each passing day, the idea of unity between the Chosen People and the Club is fading away. Instead, the most mundane and primitive particularisms come to the foreground. If we do not stop this process and remind the Widzewians who they are, what their tasks and enemies are, soon all of  New Canaan will be plunged into the chaos of civil war."
ZYD_the_decalogue_upgrade:0 "Improvement of the Decalogue"
ZYD_the_decalogue_upgrade_desc:0 "Yahweh Himself has visited our most pious men tonight in a dream. They claim that He ordered them to amend the Decalogue immediately and to extend it significantly. After a short analysis, it can be seen that the proposed changes will seriously increase the rigor to which the citizens of Widzew will be subjected. There is also an emphasis on obedience to Yahweh, Elders, Prophets of Faith and the Rabbi. The Second Arrivals are protesting against the appropriation of secular law competences by religious law. However, it cannot be denied that such an extensive Decalogue could become a guarantee of peace, unity and unanimity amongst the Chosen People if it were to be implemented as law."
ZYD_limitation_of_the_autonomy_of_the_twelve_tribes:0 "Limiting the Twelve Tribes' Autonomy"
ZYD_limitation_of_the_autonomy_of_the_twelve_tribes_desc:0 "While it goes without saying that the system of division between the twelve tribes of Widzew’s twelve streets made it possible to create the framework for our new Polin thanks to its "flexibility", it’s now only a ball and chain. The Hooligan Communes of Widzew, independent of anything, are habitats of moral decay and are the source of endless class divides and outright antagonism among them. A functioning state cannot be built on this basis. While we can... respect the distinctiveness of individual tribes in the cultural sense of the word, their legal independence from the central government must be abolished."
ZYD_alcohol_rationing:0 "Alcohol Rationing"
ZYD_alcohol_rationing_desc:0 "One of the most pressing problems affecting our land is alcoholism. Although, according to the decalogue, we cannot refuse any beer from suckers, it causes huge problems with the organization and morale of our warriors. They do not know moderation and are not able to go about their duties for most of the time. There are even rumors that the losers deliberately supply them with alcohol so that Widzewiaks wouldn't be able to rob them. Something has to be done about it. The first arrivals proposed to extend the Decalogue even further - by imposing the obligation to consume kosher beer, distributed directly by rabbis and establishing non-alcoholic holidays such as Passover, we will manage to reduce this problem."
ZYD_warriors_overview:0 "The Warriors Census"
ZYD_warriors_overview_desc:0 "Although it is a shame to admit it, The Club, despite the revived fervor among its fans, continues to scrape the bottom of the barrel - most of the communal teams can handle our theoretically best players without much effort. How are we to maintain the enthusiasm of the Twelve Tribes if their most important representation, their highest source of inspiration, is not able to score a goal playing against a team of perpetually drunk loiterers? Anyways, frankly speaking, it would be difficult to distinguish them anyway... We have to find players who, with the deadly effectiveness of their game and its emotional style, will inspire our soldiers to fight in the name of the Chosen Club, the Chosen People and God Almighty."
ZYD_eleven_felash:0 "Eleven of Falashas"
ZYD_eleven_felash_desc:0 "The First Arrivals, seeing the problems with the first rank of Yahweh's warriors, suggested to us the idea of bringing black players of Mosaic faith. Of course, these talented players won't come to us for free, but it's a game worth playing. In addition to having a real dream team, thanks to them, we will emphasize the religious unity and acceptance of the Chosen People and encourage our foreign brothers to support our effort to release the Philistines and Ammonites from other clubs. ŁKS had insulted us and Yahweh with their crooked grins for long enough."
ZYD_eleven_sons_of_labour:0 "Eleven of Working People"
ZYD_eleven_sons_of_labour_desc:0 "The Second Arrivals suggested that we respect those who put the most effort into building our state, that is, the workers. Although the appointment of suckers to the RTS eleven may come as a kind of shock to members of the Twelve Tribes, and it is likely that there will be much anxiety about such a decision. However, Second Arrivals, along with the Kibic, will emphasize that it will improve our opinion among the losers themselves and thus increase the efficiency of their work. When asked about the possible football abilities of this team, Kibic replied that he would personally ensure that each match ended with our victory - he replied that he could afford it, and in "NIE" he would describe everything as it should be."
ZYD_pitches_of_prayer:0 "Pitches of Prayer"
ZYD_pitches_of_prayer_desc:0 "The day of the match is so much more than an opportunity for us to have a brawl. Together with the first whistle, the songs of faith resound. Within RTS’ players on the pitch Samson's strength, David's bravery and Joshua's tenacity are reborn. Each goal confirms the covenant that Yahweh has made with us, each of our victories, each psalm sung together on the pitch - our thanks and our testimony of faith. The immortal teaching of Abraham - Moses - Isaiah - Ezekiel - Jeremiah lives whenever a red flare lights up the sky.\n\nLet's celebrate the Match Day!"
ZYD_communal_and_robbery_economy:0 "Communal-Robbery Economy"
ZYD_communal_and_robbery_economy_desc:0 "The entire territory of New Canaan is divided among the Twelve Tribes. Their members live in communes with a few hundred members where they drink beer, watch games and beat the shit out of each other. Of course, they do not work and collect funds from suckers, that is, those who have employment. In theory, it was supposed to allow them to learn hand-to-hand combat, study Torah and pray for the Club and the Nation. This system can no longer be maintained - our army is a drunken, parasitic mob who can neither hold a bat straight nor quote even a half-line of the Book of Numbers. They don't know how or what to fight for. In addition, they consume a huge amount of goods that no one is able to control"
ZYD_wrath_of_the_losers:0 "Wrath of the Suckers"
ZYD_wrath_of_the_losers_desc:0 "In addition to the priestly leadership caste and Widzew fans, the third social group in our country are suckers (losers) - working people and targets of muggings and beatings. While at the beginning we managed to keep them in check, now strikes and unrest are increasing mainly due to the growing greed of the Warriors of Israel. Of course, this has had a terrible effect on our industrial production. We can't beat the pagans or ŁKS with slingshots and broken baseball bats. We have to do something about it."
ZYD_the_kibbutz_reform:0 "The Kibbutz Reform"
ZYD_the_kibbutz_reform_desc:0 "The First Arrivals claim that they have found a solution to our economic problems. They propose to transform hooligan communes into kibbutzim. Under a certain religious regime, our warriors would begin to cultivate the land and initially perform simple craftsmanship. That way, we would give them a tangible job, increase production, and we could calm the mood among suckers. Engrossed in work and prayer, hooligans will not have time or will to mug. However, it will be difficult to force them to do so, most of them do not have a trade in their hands, let alone in their legs and heads. Religious and vocational education will take a while."
ZYD_sending_widzewiaks_to_factories:0 "Sending Widzewians to the Factories"
ZYD_sending_widzewiaks_to_factories_desc:0 "The Second Arrivals believe that the best solution would be the actual or partial liquidation of the communes and sending the Widzewians to factories as workers and "informal guards". A few nice words, a short "political and religious" training session and there will be peace among the losers and Widzew will finally serve us. Kibic took on the organization of this venture and its "ideological and media foundation". It won't take long, and the results can be… exceptionally fruitful."
ZYD_usury_as_an_alternative_to_robbery:0 "Usury - Alternative to Robbery"
ZYD_usury_as_an_alternative_to_robbery_desc:0 "Although tradition-honored robbery is an integral part of the ethos of Widzew's people, maintaining this state causes various complications - it is difficult to control the economy when every plan is countered by arbitrary actions of Yahweh's warriors. Our scholars of faith, after many days of studying the sacred texts and in cooperation with the Second visitors from Kibic's sign, have found a solution to this problem. Usury given to suckers, as a financial operation, by its nature is a constant and predictable factor, and in certain, appropriate interpretations it could be synonymous with robbery. A short course in Jewish economics will make it clear to the audience that this is much more profitable than simple robberies."
ZYD_discuss_of_the_high_command:0 "Case of the High Command"
ZYD_discuss_of_the_high_command_desc:0 "By making the necessary economic reforms and restraining the desires of our brothers, we can begin to think about taking over the entire voivodeship and most importantly - returning to our True, Original Canaan - Łódź. On the road to the War for the Fatherland and on our return there stands only ŁKS' Sons and Daughters of Corinth. They are godless Jebusites who graduated from Pabianice, who let gingers pass forward in queues. Savages who lick plates after rolls and confuse Reksio with Krecik. Our warriors often do not know how to fight, they think that baseball bats are used for playing games. We have to choose leaders who will teach them the art of war and lead them against Śródmieście’s Plague."
ZYD_rabbis_as_commanders:0 "Command in the Hands of Rabbi-Trainers"
ZYD_rabbis_as_commanders_desc:0 "The key to success is always morale and support from the very top. The rabbis have already proved that they are more than able to motivate the Widzewians to act: their initiatives have re-ignited the embers of religious fervor among the Chosen People. Each day's fiery sermons and imaginative parables teach us about the power of the Renewed Covenant and those who are not worthy of it. After the speeches there is a period of intense physical training during which psalms are sung. Giving the command to the rabbis seems obvious - the Twelve Tribes would enter with them even into the burning Sodom."
ZYD_good_old_comrades:0 "Good Ol' Comrades"
ZYD_good_old_comrades_desc:0 "Though Yahweh has shown us His grace by renewing the Covenant, it would be arrogant to demand his support at all times. We have to build our army upon a solid foundation, and religious raptures are not such a thing. Though many have died, there among us are still old officers from the time when Polin’s army fought under the Red Banner and under divine auspices. Their knowledge and their children will be the head of our new army. Regular, professional training, political and religious training, the watchful eye of secret comrades and the sweeping wave of conscription will remake Widzew into a force against which our enemies will tremble."
ZYD_sanctioning_the_kibbutz_cult_of_strength:0 "Sanctioning the Hooligan's Cult of Strength"
ZYD_sanctioning_the_kibbutz_cult_of_strength_desc:0 "Among Widzewians, adoration of strength, brutality and domination is widespread. For the sake of fame, power over other people and to prove their mettle, they are able to do things that no one else would dare to do. They are second to none in their bravado on the battlefield. Some radical rabbis feel that they are subconsciously proud of their covenant with Yahweh, of the grace He has bestowed upon them. The rabbis also claim that this element of the Hooligans culture should be exposed and sanctified. For He Who Is, chose Us to make all suckers tremble before us."
ZYD_davids_army:0 "David's Mighty Warriors"
ZYD_davids_army_desc:0 "The Twelve Tribes are becoming more and more like the ancient tribes of the first Homeland. They wear steel breastplates made of scrap metal, they make shields from it, which they polish in such a way that the sunlight reflecting on them blinds their enemies. They excel in the use of slingshots and captured rifles. All this takes place under the supervision of rabbis, to the sounds of songs written by King David, to the light of the menorah and the sounds of Widzew’s football matches. Even our starting eleven put on sandals and tunics with the logo of the Chosen Club and the Star of David. Today we are like our Second King - inconspicuous, but ready to defeat any Goliath that stands in our way. We too are ready to restore the lost glory to the Chosen People. It is our divine duty."
ZYD_recreation_of_wzw:0 "Refurbishing the Internal Military Service"
ZYD_recreation_of_wzw_desc:0 "Our old but new People's Army must be reliable. It would be for the best if the professionals take care of it. Religious fervor evoked by the rabbis cannot guarantee this. There used to be a certain organization, which exemplarily controlled our armed forces, protecting them against subversive ideas and taking care of appropriate ideological reinforcement. We have to reconstruct the Internal Military Service to keep our Army clean. Staff will be composed of the most intelligent and obedient Widzewians, trained by the still alive ex-officers of this formation. They will also make an excellent foundation for our Intelligence and Counterintelligence groups."
ZYD_restoration_of_discipline:0 "Restoration of Discipline"
ZYD_restoration_of_discipline_desc:0 "We have succeeded in doing the impossible. Former, uncouth hooligans, thinking only about drinking beer and beating sucke...working masses of towns and villages, today they march in steady pace, dressed in singular patterned uniforms, singing The International at the same time. All this under the watchful eye of intelligence officers from the WSW and certain ideological-religious commissars. As Kibic writes in 'NIE' - "No one has any doubts anymore - PR has again the strength and means to restore order in the brown Polish wilderness. Polish-Jewish Hooligan-Workers Army awaits orders to deal with the National-Philistine revolution. Their first targets will be antisemitic bandits and worker exploiters from ŁKS."
ZYD_sharpening_the_old_sticks:0 "Carving New Bats"
ZYD_sharpening_the_old_sticks_desc:0 "The amount of new weapons will be plentiful. This is all we need now to embark on a holy fight. Rabbi went on a tour in his Ark of the Covenant again. It cannot fit any more donations. Everyone is pitching into our joint effort. Anyone capable of wielding a combat baseball bat will be ready to fulfill his duty promised to Yahweh, his People and the Club. Our football players are also traveling from city to city, from commune to commune, village to village encouraging for intensified effort. Meanwhile, the woods are silent as a grave. They smell of fear. Time to restore order to New Canaan. Then, the time will come to reclaim the Old One."
ZYD_pacyfication_of_the_lks_remnants:0 "Pacification of ŁKS Remnants"
ZYD_pacyfication_of_the_lks_remnants_desc:0 "For the last year, we have lived in fear in a truly Jobbish land. Like Hagar who bore Abraham a son through dedication to God, we have become quite strong again through the renewed Covenant. However, we cannot stop there. In our forests there are still bandits - the cursed descendants of the incestuous relationship of Lot and his daughters - the Ammonites of Retkinia, The Moabites of Polesie. Their very existence is an offense to Yahweh's majesty. We will not allow bandits of nationalist origin to terrorize all the tribes and peoples that live in the Third, Provisional Canaan. Our land."
ZYD_forced_converions:0 "Forced Conversions"
ZYD_forced_converions_desc:0 "The rabbis have put forward an interesting proposal regarding our approach regarding ŁKS. They recalled the existence of the Samaritan people in the ancient times of Israel. They were Jews not included in the Covenant - converts from other faiths. They served as guest workers and legwork men, which was unworthy for any member of the Chosen People. Nothing stands in the way of renewing the existence of Samaritans in our modern conditions. Captured ŁKS hooligans will be forced to recognise the power of Yahweh, if they ever want to be free again. And with that, they would also accept our laws."
ZYD_forced_labor:0 "Forced Labor"
ZYD_forced_labor_desc:0 "It is known that we have to deal with ŁKS. These polish fascists can no longer be free people, and especially free to rob our comrade workers mercilessly. But why should we waste their potential? Many of them will not stand the pressure and they will fall into our hands. And those who don't work - they don't eat. You can always work in various ways; cut the forest, dig peat. Sometimes it is even possible to achieve something after a sufficiently long "internship". Let it be freedom. Of course, "freedom" under strict supervision of the WSW. After all, we are talking about politically and religiously uncertain elements.."
ZYD_taking_the_dogs_off_the_leash:0 "Letting the Dogs off the Leash"
ZYD_taking_the_dogs_off_the_leash_desc:0 "The flames of faith that burst alight in the hearts of the Chosen Club’s admirers is like the one that burns within the bowels of Leviathan. It will consume everything that stands in its way. It will only leave ashes to fertilize the land for the sucker plowmen to cultivate. Indeed, terrible is the wrath of the Twelve Tribes; a threat from their lips would be fatal for the hearts of weaker people - it would render them still. There is no hope for the enemies of the sons of Israel, descendants of David and Solomon, grandsons of Moses. Canaan will be drenched in blood, both Old and New. This shall be our sacrifice, the true lamb of God."
ZYD_zomo_action:0 "ŻOMO Action"
ZYD_zomo_action_desc:0 "Who is better prepared to fight the scourge of anti-Zionist banditry than specially trained, motorized emergency forces? Even groups of bandits most strongly bound by class-national hatred will lose in a direct clash with a disciplined force of the working class, which in addition has a technological superiority. We have are enough Lublin and T4 reserves to create a special brigade, our pride and terror for our enemy. Both external and internal."
ZYD_rts_is_a_power:0 "RTS IS POWERFUL!"
ZYD_rts_is_a_power_desc:0 "The Chosen People are one once again. Nobody can match our army. Nobody eats to their heart's content like our brothers and our sisters. Yahweh did not have to give us manna and streams of drinking water. In the desert, dangerous and inhospitable, we have built a real oasis from just the sand. His Word and our unbending will, faith in the Chosen People’s victory and the Club were enough. The Rabbi stands today on top of the Tomaszów Chimney and watches how wonderful his Country is all around. But also, he waits for a word from Yahweh..."

Nobody knows what Yahweh is planning, but the storm that is gathering over our heads and the dozens of lightning bolts approaching each moment make us anxious. The Rabbi, however, with a stone-cold face, awaits whatever the future will bring. Hopefully Yahweh will be gracious."

ZYD_sanhedryn_desc:0 "Rabbi came down from the chimney a changed man. He doesn't eat or drink, he hasn't said a single word for days. Many of us have already begun to worry, not knowing what this might mean. Today, however, he shouted that the council of the Elders was to gather immediately without taking his eyes off the sky. He has something important to relay to them."

ZYD_rabbi_is_dead_desc:0 "It couldn't be. It is hard to believe in such a coincidence. The last person who stood up for reactionism lies lifeless at the foot of the Tomaszów Chimney. ŻOMO and WSW already received secret orders. It's time to end this 'Tactical Alliance'."

ZYD_seven_miracles_desc:0 "The Sky turned black even though the Earth was bright. The hooligan's bats began to grow buds, which soon hardened and became sharp barbs. Even though there were no clouds, the rain fell crimson. People picking it up in rain barrels discovered that it was Kadarka. White dust appeared on the ground next to the blades of grass. Sniffing it, Widzewiaks felt a huge surge of strength. The rust started to peel off spontaneously from the Ark of the Covenant, and from under it, untouched by time, its smooth, immaculate bodywork emerged. At the border of our state, lightning began to strike our enemies’ territory, lighting fires as far as the eye could see. Rabbi, despite the fact that a powerful wind had risen in Tomaszów, has climbed the chimney again, holding the Banner of the Covenant and the original bat in his hands. His voice carries over the wind’s terrible, bellowing, rumbling laughter. The first and second arrivals, Widzewiaks and losers, all gather in amazement at the Tower קאָנטאַקט. Everyone is waiting for the words of Rabbi..."

ZYD_revenge_on_coal_desc:0 "All this confusion meant that we did not manage to send the next batch of raw materials to the Brotherhood of Coal. Our industry has practically stopped. Can you imagine a better situation to start the War for the Promised Land? Anyone who dares to mock the People of Yahweh must know the wrath of the Leviathan that lurks in our hearts. Now it is us who will take tribute from the unbelievers. Widzew’s flag will fly over their infernal factories and power stations soon."

ZYD_challenge_of_strength_desc:0 "They say that in the forests of the West, wild and violent peoples have appeared, full of youthful vigor and unbridled aggression. If we are to garner respect among the Losers, we must make them realize that no one will ever be equal to us. No one will defeat the Children of Israel in an equal fight. Only we are worthy enough and our attitudes pure enough to mug them."

ZYD_new_synagogues_and_stadiums_desc:0 "Wherever our foot stood, there must be something that will make its print stay there for good, as a show of our might. Houses of prayer, and newly built stadiums next to them, are the basis of our presence in every corner of the lands we claim. The former to strengthen our spirit, reminding us of our ancestors’ example, and the latter to match our present, most important warriors. Their golden domes shine a light so divine that any non-believers will have no choice but to look away."

ZYD_blooming_business_desc:0 "In the North an Enterprise of Death is thriving. The profits of the Skrzydlewski family and other organizations exceed all expectations. It cannot be denied that Yahweh gave them a lot and they knew how to multiply it to even more gigantic proportions. But there is one thing the Lord has not given them: the Covenant. They are still suckers, no matter how extraordinarily wealthy they might be. It's time to remind them of that..."

ZYD_last_obstacle_desc:0 "A strange event took place a few days ago. Several of our illustrious and aged rabbis traveling north for commercial purposes were assaulted by a gang of disguised men with magnificent beards and red-dyed hair. When they refused to consume the suspicious drink that was offered to them, they were called 'Traitors of the (((Dwarven))) Race' and assaulted them  with hammers and axes. They barely got away. This incident cannot go unnoticed, although it takes our attention away from the main goal of our journey."

ZYD_central_committee_meeting_desc:0 "Citizens, working people of towns and villages! Our Brothers and Our Sisters in Faith! There was a tragedy in the morning today. The heart of the fighter and genius continuator of the work of Moses, the wise Leader and Teacher of the Hebrew Faith and the genius theorist of Marxism - Solomonism, is no longer among us... His heartbeat had stopped. Unifier of the Chosen People and he who shared this burden with all of us. We loved Him. Like a Father and like a Friend. All free Polin is united in pain, but this must have been the will of Yahweh. It's not hard to be completely baffled, shocked, and devastated right now. The Party knows about it, and Comrade Kibic, the most faithful friend of Rabbi, knows it too. For this reason, he will temporarily take over leadership of the administration of Polin. Comrade Kibic announces that in the near future a great meeting of the party and the people will be held, combined with a referendum on the matters of the state leadership and its functioning. The goal is to reestablish order and the rule of law as to mend the tears this short-term disintegration of state structures has caused. The date for the grand vote is..."

ZYD_fifth_generation_of_ak_desc:0 "We have to deal with Polish dreamers once again. How many years do we have to deal with their constant resurfacings? They survived all the purges, blended into society and poisoned it from the inside. We must put an end to this. Never again will a boy in a toy uniform dare raise a hand against a Brave Militia Man, a Diligent Proletarian, a Vigilant Security Service or a Jew in a cream suit."

ZYD_recruit_collaborators_desc:0 "We could use a few extra people to have some eyes pointed at the others. Each new citizen of the People's Republic of Polin could potentially be involved in subversive activities. And thanks to such initiatives, we will ensure that the proletarians can rest easy because their interests remain unchallenged. There will certainly be many willing, especially right after the ŻOMO unit is sent to their area."

ZYD_rotten_capitalism_desc:0 "By virtue of his gentle heart, the First Secretary likes when someone is successful. He understands perfectly well that the free market can be not only a source of huge income, but also extraordinary thrills. At one point in his life, he forced himself to invest in Ford. But unlike many other home-grown Rockefellers, he wasn't concerned with competition. He knew he was second to none. After all, no one can win against the vanguard of the proletariat. And this is what the capitalists of Krośniewice must realize."

ZYD_slavic_reactionism_desc:0 "The First secretary of the Polin Jewish Workers Party likes to read something casual in his spare time. Hence, he had the pleasure of getting acquainted with the cutting words of another native of Łódź. And here was the dilemma. How does one treat that state, that monarchy nonetheless, born of pastiche and satire on the mass hysteria surrounding Jara Śmietana, Hoży Swarog and Krase Tylne Lico Płotki? Kibic thought, pondered and after a while he knew it - as a joke. And he sent his army to the border."

ZYD_allija_desc:0 "We have been waiting for this day for a long time, our hopeful souls are brimming with anticipation for what's to come. Our Home, Our Canaan, can already be seen looming over the horizon. Great Łódź. Great Widzew. The Homeland of Labor. The Homeland of our people. Even the toughest, most stoic of us are not able to hide our emotions. Not when they believed that they would be able to walk again in the shadow of the Tenements. Our Tenements."

zydzew.1.t:0 "Book of Genesis"
zydzew.1.desc:0 "Yahweh looked at Canaan of the North and said:\n- "Great are the crimes of the nation with whom I once estabilished a covenant. The dust fell on the old trophies, the last witnesses of the former glory."\n\nYahweh then looked at New Jerusalem and said:\n- "Great is the corruption which has struck the chosen land. Green paper and gold calves are worshiped in my place. Jerusalem became a Sodom. The Israelites of the Widzew family fraternize with the loser Jebusites of the Śródmieście family. My people have forgotten the terms of the covenant. They eat from one bowl, and drink from one can as one, with those who do not know my name. There is not one righteous among them."\n\nThen Yahweh looked at the chiefs of the Widzew house and said:\n- "Where are the rulers of old who praised my name? Where is the Word left pure, free from lies and greed? They sold themselves. There is not one righteous among them."\n\nThen he looked at the warriors of Yahweh.\n- "Great is the weakness of my people. No one of its members is in the front line of Widzew's warriors. And eleven there I see unworthy strangers, eleven enemies of the tribe with whom I made a covenant. In gold they only believe. In gold and nothing more. There is not one righteous among them."\n\nGreat was Yahweh's anger. He said then:\n- “I say: It will be seven days and seven nights before the rain of flames falls on the new Sodom, once called My land. If a righteous man remains there, let him save those who can be saved and go south. Into wilderness. They will save the righteous, and they will suffocate sinners."\n\nRabbi lived then in Lodz, the last faithful servant of Yahweh. The sins of the chosen people did not drown out their faith in the victory of the Chosen Club and the Almighty Lord. For six days and six nights, he walked the streets of Łódź carrying the red flag, the symbol of the Covenant. On the seventh day, he and those who followed him were exiled. Sinners feared their renewed faith. This is how the twelve faithful tribes of Widzew came out of the twelve streets of the corrupted land.\n\nOn the seventh night, fire fell on Łódź, and the sky turned black."

zydzew.2.t:0 "Book of Exodus"
zydzew.2.desc:0 "And thus Yahweh sent trucks to the chosen people. They were full of baseball bats, and none of them had a ball. The first bat, Rabbi kept for himself. Armed, the Lord's Faithful obtained food from the surrounding towns and villages.\n\nOn the fourteenth day, the Widzew tribes found people dressed in black. Their beards, hair, and noses were long. They were the Original and most faithful servants of Yahweh. They rejoiced greatly when the Rabbi greeted them with matzah and a dressing. Before the relief of his armies, they suffered much from the heathens. They told him many stories about the old days. Together they moved on as one tribe of He Who Is.\n\nOn the twenty-second day, more sons of the Chosen People were found by the twelve tribes on their way. They were clothed in suits, without beards and long noses, but they knew the word of Yahweh, and they were born of the tribe of Israel. And the Rabbi also greeted them with matzah and dressings. Before the relief of his armies, they suffered with wrath from the heathen. They told Rabbi much about the recent history of the People. Together they moved on as one tribe of He Who Is.\n\nYahweh's old and new servants have brought light, long ago overshadowed by corruption. The §BLight of God§! as §RHis People§!, People of §BFaith§! as well as §RWork§!. At that time they agreed and together they purified the twelve tribes of their former harshness.\n\nOn the fortieth day, the Rabbi, carrying a red flag, and a bat stained with blood in his other hand, saw the wilderness. Yahweh then spoke to him, "Behold, the Promised Land." That is also what Rabbi has said unto the people. At that time the tribes scattered, establishing communes where the land was empty for the sons of Yahweh and full of suckers to work. This is how the People of Widzew came to the south."

zydzew.3.t:0 "Book of Leviticus"
zydzew.3.desc:0 "Together the Chosen People besieged the city as one. However, the defense of Tomaszów inhabitants was tough. From the innumerable ruins of the city, they collected bricks and erected a wall around the town. Neither bats nor furious fists could cope with it, because the stones fired from the slings repelled Widzewians, be it during the day or at night. Then the Rabbi summoned Elders to his seat to consult them, what must be done to conquer the fortified city, for the glory and household of the People and the Chosen Club.\n\nFirst Elder, called the Tiger by his listeners, said:\n\n"Rabbi, Yahweh spoke to me in a dream and so ordered that the city should be conquered -\nThe residents of Tomaszów can see the movements of our troops with cameras. I know how to destroy them without the use of a bat or a fist. Sneak to the Great Chimney, i must, which in the heart of the city lies, among the factory that sign of the PZPR bears and send a signal, destroying the monitoring. Then their slingshots at night will be inaccurate, because they will not pierce the darkness with their eyes"\n\nThen the §BFirst Arrivals said:§!\n“- He says the truth, the will of Yahweh speaks through him. In order for him to be able to sneak through, the trumpets must be blown along the entire line of the walls and walk towards it slowly at night. When the stones stop hitting accurately, our charge will sweep the wall away. But our warriors must be strong, only make them train day and night, Rabbi, so that they can break through the wall. We will show them how they should make themselves strong"\n\nThus they did so, capturing the city. When the §RSecond Arrivals§! also entered it, all fighting ceased. Sight of them and their words about the former glory of the city soothed the people of Tomaszów. The anger at the §BFirsts§! was relieved.\n\nRabbi said to his counselors when the city was taken:\n“Your words contained much wisdom, so you shall go and give it to others, so that the Chosen both People and the Club may be strong. And you, Tiger, you shall teach us about the secrets of electronics.”\n\nThus the priests dispersed among the twelve tribes of Widzew, teaching them about the glory of the past and praise the dexterity of arms and legs. And it was a difficult learning, after years of Sodom Darkness and unwritten peace with the Philistines of Łódź Śródmieście.""

zydzew.4.t:0 "Book of Numbers"
zydzew.4.desc:0 "When the first year of the stay of the Chosen People in the Promised Land passed, all Polin began to come to them fleeing the persecution of their fellowmen. They were poor, exhausted by the aversion that befell them on all sides. Among them was a great, aged man, a dove-hearted philanthropist, who took the name of a Kibic in order to come closer to the Chosen Club. He soon founded a newspaper in Tomaszów to praise the work of the Homeland Conquest. Every Widzewian quickly became a faithful reader of the NIE journal - a voice of opposition to persecution and an advocate of Total Reclamation.\n\nThe pages of this journal enumerated the destruction suffered by Polin and how much the Chosen People had lost. Not only during the Fall, but for the past thirty years as well. Thousands of workplaces, hundreds of thousands of prefabricated flats, millions of dollars for privatization. However, Kibic was unwavering when asked about his feelings:\n\n"I don't give a shit," he would reply as he continued to write. He was a great inspiration to the twelve tribes, maintaining a swashbuckling vigor despite his advanced age. He invested profits from the daily in Ford and Toyota through contacts with other members of the Chosen People. In this way, he collected capital and multiplied his potential. However, he did it only as an exception to the success of the case of the Chosen Club.\n\nHowever, in neighboring countries, lies began to be said that the §RRed Goebbels§! had been put to a pedestal again."

zydzew.5.t:0 "Book of Deuteronomy"
zydzew.5.desc:0 "A year has passed with the presence of the Twelve Tribes in the new homeland. Then the Rabbi saw how much evil was happening in the Third Canaan. Each tribe was after all the others. To take over the suckers to work and mug, as well as wealth and land. There were too few rabbis-trainers and sometimes they succumbed to the drives of fratricidal fights and encouraged their fellows to do so. At last the Lord visited him in a dream and said to him:\n-“Rabbi, the people with whom I have made a covenant, once again trampling upon his terms. Where has unity gone?"\n\nAnd thus Rabbi replied:\n- “Yahweh the Great, what shall we do when too little of us knows the Word, and even less is able to deliver it? What are we to do when your will has been made known only to a few, the old Covenant has remained only in the soul, not in our minds?"\n\nAnd Yahweh replied:\n-“Let the Covenant be renewed then. I will hand over the law to you, and you will hang it in the area, order a decent mural to be made, and you will not spare any sprays. The word will become the law of the streets again and everyone will know it."\n\nSo Rabbi commanded to do. He also took a flat piece of concrete and sprayed the Law of the Renewed Covenant on it. Then he took it, along with his bat and the red banner with which he led the Tribes out of Łódź, and placed them in Daewoo Lanos. After that, he sealed the car and kept the keys for himself. Four times a year, he travels around the lands of the Twelve Tribes, and it is always a great celebration."

zydzew.6.desc:0 "Rabbi didn’t wait even a second to think as he descended from the chimney with godlike haste. Never before has he been seen wreathed in this hazy, intoxicating aura of zeal. Everyone gathered there at the base of the chimney quickly swarmed around him, to hear what knowledge Yahweh had passed unto him this time. Before anyone could ask even a single question, Rabbi began speaking. His voice thundered through the crowd with unwavering confidence./n/n - My dear comrades! I have for you the greatest of news. The moment we’ve all been so eagerly awaiting has finally come! Yahweh is calling us all to battle, for the gates of our Canaan have been spotted on our horizons. I was blessed with visions of miracles in the hour of our Holiest of wars! Set alight Yahweh’s flame within your heart! Go out and share this scorching, inspiring and undying flame with all those unfortunate enough to not hear these words first hand! Everyone must hear and must burn with passion as these are the final days of our preparations and we must work harder than ever before! Now go with Yahweh, and spread these holy words of utmost importance!/n/nAnd so, as soon as Rabbi finished his rousing speech, or rather his prophecy, everyone, including even the suckers went to share the words of their lord to everyone. Together their hearts will burn like a wildfire, that will scorch anyone who dares stand in its righteous path."

When the red-faced rabbi-trainer finally took him out of his mouth, members of the Drzewica-Piłsudski kibbutz stood in front of him, in a relatively even row. All confused, with dark circles under the eyes and stained tracksuits. The rabbi looked at them disgusted, hid his hands behind his back and slowly walked in front of his charges. A cold breeze tugged his tallit as he delivered his speech.\n- I am Rabbi Moshe, from this day on your trainer and work instructor. You will only speak when i let you, you will adress me accordingly. IS. THAT. UNDERSTOOD YOU WRETCHED MAGGOTS?!\n- Yes, Rabbi - gathered replied slugglishly\n- WHAT WAS THAT?! I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!! YOU ALL SOUND LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH JEHOVAH IN YOUR HEARTS. AGAIN!\n- YES, RABBI!!! - This time sound of roaring crowd could be certainly heard from a few miles\n- If we can build real kibbutz here, in this shithole, if you'll get through the professional training, some day you shall be true warriors of the lineage of Abraham. You're going to be fucking avatars of David, praying that there would be enough Philistines to fuck them up. But until that day comes, in hierarchy you're even below losers. You have to prove yourselves, that Yahweh has created you on sixth day, not the first one. If needs be, i'm gonna chase you with a fucking bat through all the Days of Creation. I'll not shed a tear for those who'll choose to remain among the vermin. I guess, that's how Yahweh made You. - Rabbi Moshe took the whistle in his mouth again and blew it with full force.\n- Get the hoes and start working. Garlic will not plant itself."

A young, well-built lad in his work clothes stands on the bridge, right next to the plant. He's leaning against the railing while having a smoke. He looks down from time to time seeing strangely constructed dry riverbed. Bridge appears to be also a dam. On the other side there used to be a pond, completely green with algae.\n- There used to be a canoe course here. Well, there's no one to swim here now... - Lad turns back to see who's talking to him. He saw an old man closing in to him, dressed also in his working outfit.\n- Interesting... - boy replies and takes a whiff of his cigarette.\n- We even had Olympians! They brought several medals, even gold ones! There - he points at the lower course of the track - is a monument dedicated to them.\n The boy sees a tear curling in the old man's eye.\n - Maybe some day someone will swim here again.. - replies timidly.\n Old man smiles.\n - You would do fine, you've got brawn. I saw myself how you carried away that thug into the forest.\n Young lad chokes on cigarette smoke.\n- Ah, don't you worry. I used to be just like You. Only back then it was called ORMO. After all, we too were keeping peace. - Lad starts to act seemingly concerned - Yeah, i also rocked the kayaks, heh. Well, now. Break's over. If you'd like, come over someday. I can teach you something about swimming, i have still my old kayak in garage. About the job, though...i can show you some tricks also. Your technique needs a few adjustments. Some day you might be not able to get things done.\n The old man steps away from the railings and walks towards the factory gate. Lad looks at him. He was just an ordinary sucker, but somehow nicer than others."
