 POLITICS_TOMIO_DESC: "The fallen leaves tell a story, and when the last of them from the Great Prague Elm fell on Okamura Tomio's face, he finally stood up. The situation after the Fall of Poland also hit the Czech Republic. After they were forcibly transformed into an EU protectorate, not all of them remained passive. Tomio Okamura, the spirit of Czech pragmatism and Japanese steadfastness, began to gather around him those who wanted to fight. However, the occupation forces quickly outlawed his political party and threatened to arrest the rebellious politician. Okamura's wisdom overtook the enemy's movement and he managed to escape from the Czech capital before the planned manhunt. The fallen Poland, broken into small, anarchic pieces, turned out to be a refuge, where the new czecho-japanese daimyo can start the fight against oppression from the West."
 POLITICS_RUMCAJS_DESC: "Going through Sudety Mountains was very difficult for Tomio Okamura's army. All the chaos, fighting Poles and Eurokommissariat forces, roaming bandits looking for easy loot and of course cold nights, strong wind, and dump clothes. It could end in high attrition and number of casualties, if not him. He's called Rumcajs, but nobody knows who he really is. His scary menpo and kabuto always stay on him whenever somebody is around. Meeting with Daimyo was also as mysterious as that. Tired army met him right at the border, where he greeted them with strange-sounding Japanese. Together with his squad of also masked men, he offered his guidance during the hard route through the mountains. The Daimyo accepted his service, not really sure for his intentions. Well... Brave men like him are too precious to ask too many questions."
 POLITICS_KOMOROWSKI_DESC: "§LThe second (after Bronisław Piłsudski) Japanese culture lover and propagator form Poland. He was the first president of the Republic of Poland to grant the Shogun nomination to a Polish general. However, after losing the elections, he removed himself from high-profile politics only periodically criticizing the ruling coalition. The fall changed everything. The former president decided to leave the restless capital ruled by the remnants of hostile power. When he heard about the Japanese-Czech commander creating his state in the south, he decided to take advantage of the long-gone chance. As a specialist in diplomacy with the Far East and, of course, a former president, he offered his services to the daimyo of Kłodzko, who accepted.§!"   
 POLITICS_MASTER_JAKUB_DESC: "§LMaster Jakub is loyal only to the Sword and the Sword is currently carried by daimyo Okamura. He followed Tomio not because of similar beliefs, common interests or a desire for glory, but by the idea of ​​the unyielding warrior he represents. That was definitely enough to offer him his command, quartermaster and combat teaching services. Jakub's dojo has been training the best Czech fencers for many years and now they are daimyo personal guard, special forces and the most famous champions of Okamura's army. His skills are said to be unsurpassed, but after the collapse, there has yet to be an opponent brave enough to challenge the master to a duel. The leader has a strong ally in him, but he is guided by more than obedience, and this can be a little worrying.§!"
 POLITICS_FUJI_DESC: "§LThe right hand of the daimyo long before he even embarked on the warpath. As a professional politician and Okamura's trusted man in the new, uncouth region, he became the chief administrator of Han. When the next campaigns are carried out from under bakufu, the order must be kept and new laws must be introduced in every conquered town or village. This task is handled by Fuji, who, in the absence of the Okamura, conveys his will to his lord's subjects. Mostly he is known for his open and benevolent hand, but he can show what the punishing iron fist of daimyo rule is when needed, which probably affects his mental state. Nevertheless, he performs the tasks entrusted to him thoroughly and is one of the most reliable men at court.§!"
 POLITICS_MIYAJIMA_DESC: "§LAkio is without a doubt the most concerned person in the daimyo's court. It's hard to say how he ended up on the warlord's council, but he's here on an important mission that only he knows about. It is Miyajima who does most of the translation and maintains diplomatic relations with states that are not being conquered by the Okamura. Along with the rest of the entourage, he sometimes questions Han laws and actions towards conquered, and if it wasn't for his background, knowledge and skills, he might have incurred the wrath of someone officious a long time ago. However, thanks to his grace and peace, he is well-thought-of and respected. They say he regularly meets with former president Komorowski for talks about values not praised by warriors.§!"

CZE_flower_of_bohemio_nippon_desc: "Daimyo Okamura crossed the Carpathian Mountains with his 10,000 faithful soldiers. A real Czech-Japanese elite. Only they are fit for this fight, apart from few selected volunteers we cannot count on anyone else. §tLet the will of the daimyo grant us strength and durability for the upcoming storm.§t "

okamura.1.t: "An Unexpected Sunrise"
okamura.1.desc: "It was early dawn. In the twilight of the sleeping town of Kłodzko a great red-brick fortress loomed, reminding the Eurocommission's small garrison of its former might. One who was on a night watch, which was about to end soon, was already dozing off while standing. He was facing the north-east side thinking about those shattered wild post-polish lands and what horrible things may be going on there.\n\n Wind was gently blowing from behind. Then came slight scent of smoke, minute after minute getting stronger. Looking for the source of the smell, he walked to the other side of the fort. When he peeked out beyond the north wall and looked to the south his body froze. He saw a great fire in the distance. The pillar of flames was illuminating the still dark sky. Bystrzyca Kłodzka was all in flames. When the soldier came closer to the lower walls of the fortress, he noticed silhouettes running in the streets. "Something is terribly wrong in here." - he thought and ran to sound the alarm.\n\n Breathless he reached the switch, but then he noticed, the cable was cut. "Alarm! We are under attack!" - he screamed at the top of his lungs, but suddenly he fell silent like a Kraków bugle caller. The soldier looked down - a small blade pierced his chest. He couldn't make a sound. His muscles stopped responding. He couldn't even turn around to see his opponent, he just fell to the ground lifeless. The shinobi wiped his sword from the unaware guardian's blood and climbed the wall overlooking the town street. Then he lit a flare, signaling to the hidden waiting soldiers of the new Daimyo to attack the still sleeping town."

unification.47.t: "[GetNewspaper]Okamura Shogunate seizes Lower Silesia!"
unification.47.desc: "A recent flurry of hurried reports from incoming messengers details disturbing news from Lower Silesia. Against expectations, the main half of the voivodeship has been united under the iron hand of the shogun from the Kłodzko fortress. His fearless samurai, wearing clan sashimono and numerous, well-equipped ashigaru, managed to unify the region with steel and fire.\n\nThe newly proclaimed shogun, daimyo Tomio Okamura, did not initially have a strong position in his encampments in the rocky borderlands. Leading a risky attack on the EK garrison, battling rogue ronins, navigating the Shogunate's more radical factions, and staving off rebellious spirits, he managed to emerge victorious no matter the constant challenges thrown his way. Now, the authorities of the mighty Shogun of Vuratisurafu hastily reshape the previous power structures to develop a new, hybrid Czecho-Nipponic identity among Lower Silesia's population."
