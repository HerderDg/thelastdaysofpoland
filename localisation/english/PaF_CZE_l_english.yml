okamura.1.t:0 "A Unexpected Sunrise"
okamura.1.desc:0 "It was early dawn. In the twilight of a sleeping town of Kłodzko great red-brick fortress loomed, reminding to a Eurocommission's small garrison of its former might. One who was on a night watch, which was about to end soon, was already dozing off while standing. He was faceing north-east side thinking about those shattered wild post-polish lands and what horrible things may be going on there.\n\n Wind was gently blowing from behind. Then came slight scent of smoke, minute after minute getting stronger. Looking for the source of the smell, he walked to the other side of the fort. When he peeked out beyond the north wall and looked at south his body froze. He saw great distant fire. The pillar of fire was illuminating still dark sky. Propably Bystrzyca Kłodzka was all in flames. The soldier came closer to low walls of fortress, he noticed silhouettes running in the streets. "Something is terribly wrong in here." - he thought and ran to sound the alarm.\n\n Breathless he reached the switch, but then he noticed, the cable was cut. "Alarm! We are under attack!" - he scream the at top of his lungs, but suddenly he fell silent like a Krakow buglercaller. Soldier looked down - a small blade pierced his chest. He couldn't make a sound. His muscles stopped responding. He couldn't already turn around to see his opponent, just fell to the ground lifeless. Shinobi wiped his sword from the blood of the unaware guardian and climbed the wall overlooking the town street. Then he lit a flare, signaling to the hidden waiting soldiers of the new Daimyo to attack the still sleeping town."

unification.47.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Okamura Shogunat unites Lower Silesia"
unification.47.desc:0 "Messengers report disturbing news from Lower Silesia. The voivodeship was united under the iron hand of the shogun from Kłodzko fortress. His fearless samurai wearing clan sashimono and numerous, well-equipped ashigaru made their way to unify the region with steel and fire.\n\n The newly proclaimed shogun, daimyo Tomio Okamura, did not have a strong position as the ruler of the Kłodzko region. Leading a risky attack on EK garisson, then fighting rogue ronins, treacherous general Rumcajs, and facing the strong opposing voices of the former president of Poland, the leader of the radical wing of the shogunate, and the master, the authority of the samurai - and still succeeded. Now the authorities of the mighty shogun of Vratisowafu, hastily reshape the previous power structures, to tackle the czecho-nipponisation of the Lower Silesian population."
unification.47.a:0 "Terrifying."
