buy_german_ranged:0"Buy German Guns"
buy_german_ranged_desc:0 "Ever since the European army halted its advance, the Eurokommissariats have devolved into what is basically a country-sized black market operation, and German guns became a commonly available good or even a currency of sorts. We don't even need to search for any German ex-soldiers or smugglers, we can just hit up any local arms dealer to get our hands on them."  
buy_swedish_ranged:0"Buy Guns From Sweden"
buy_swedish_ranged_desc:0 "Very few Swedish guns have reached Poland due to the Swedish government's surprising reluctance to partake in the European intervention. Their scarcity has given them a certaint status among the populace, however, and the usage of them is seen as both more prestigious in the eyes of gangsters and as more patriotic in the eyes of the commonfolk. Through our connections with the always enigmatic Master Weapon Dealer we can secure a large supply of armament provided by Swedish smugglers for ourselves." 
buy_ukrainian_ranged:0"Strike a Deal with the Ukrainians"
buy_ukrainian_ranged_desc:0 "The Ukrainian Humanitarian Mission in Poland has fallen prey to saboteurs from Rzeszów and Nisko, leaving only those with a dubious reputation on our side of the border: nationalist ex-humanitarian workers enraged by Braun's betrayal and refusal of Ukrainian help, humanitarian workers who banded up together with Polish villagers and formed a joint quasi-military government of sorts, the few Ukrainian border guards who still occupy Medyka and gangsters. Gangsters who are more than willing to sell us their old armament, left behind by the Soviet government and the Russian army in 1991 and 2022."
buy_russian_ranged:0"Buy Russian Guns"
buy_russian_ranged_desc:0 "Once Navalny took power in Moscow and started his crusade against the corruption and crime that have been synonymous with the Russian government since times immemorial, many Russkie mafiozos and gangbangers ran abroad, trying to escape his judgement. With no perspectives in life, seemingly left to die in a hostile world, they've been saved by the downfall of the Polish state which allowed them to get back to a life of crime by forming a competition to German arms dealers and even establishing back some of the old connections with pro-Russian Polish political organisations and the remains of the old guard of Russian politics."
buy_radom_ranged:0"Sign an Arms Deal with Radom"
buy_radom_ranged_desc:0 "A real patriot supports domestic products, hence why we should hit up the arms manufacturers in Radom.

#EUROLIB#
eurolib_pro_federalist_propaganda:0 "Entrench liberal mindsets among the populace"
eurolib_pro_federalist_propaganda_desc:0 "Due to Poland's history of foreign occupations, Germanisation and Russification, Poles have adopted a very cautious and conservative approach to foreign ideas and cultural notions, which are immedeatly received by them as invasive and intrusive. We can warm the public eye's image of ourselves through cultural subsidies and development of villages and cities that have been neglected by the previous, conservative regime."
eurolib_complicate_bureaucracy:0 "Rig bureaucracy in our favour"

Ergo, they have been declared null and void, and so did your request to the Local Transitionary Government of Zadupie Dolne.'"
eurolib_taxes_increase:0 "Crank up tax revenues"
eurolib_taxes_increase_desc:0 "A liberal state has to simultaneously fund tons of projects, subsidies and investments as well as the bureaucracy associated with them. And we are slowly running out of funds and resources. Our people will have to bit their lip a bit to fund living conditions worthy of a first world state for themselves."
eurolib_agricultural_funds:0 "Subsidize agriculture"
eurolib_agricultural_funds_desc:0 "Food is hard to get by nowadays. So are other products and goods. By funding our farmers, we can win the hearts of farmers on our lands and at least slightly increase the availability of food and farm products."
eurolib_public_works_funds:0 "Subsidize public works and projects"
eurolib_public_works_funds_desc:0 "Times are hard. People are either struggling with surviving to the next day, or trying to keep their battered psyche intact. We should fund some public artists and development projects to make the reality they're living in at least a little bit less harsh and drab for them. Small local artisans who decorate houses in traditional ways, new town parks and attractions, improved city infrastructure to make their daily commute a tad more bearable - all those things will help our image and provide our people with something to admire in these bleak times."
eurolib_cultural_dev_funds:0 "Subsidize artists"
eurolib_cultural_dev_funds_desc:0 "There's much to be gained from funding various types of artists in our lands, from loudspeaking political caricaturists to small local painters, sculptors and artisanal artists. Depending on whom are we subsidizing, we can either discredit our enemies and improve the public's opinion about us, or help out small communities and aspiring artists with sharing their art with the world." 
eurolib_implement_harsher_gun_laws:0 "Enforce stricter gun control"
eurolib_implement_harsher_gun_laws_desc:0 "Even before the Fall, most gun owners in Poland were made out to be weirdos and political radicals who definitely shouldn't be allowed anywhere near firearms. However, now that every larger settlement is at war with their neighbours, this stereotype became truth. Implementing strict gun laws and strongly enforcing them in newly acquired land will not only disarm most potentially dangerous individuals in the area, but also enlarge our own stockpile of weapons."
eurolib_offensive_war_propaganda:0 "'Onwards, for a free Europa!'"
eurolib_offensive_war_propaganda_desc:0 "Though our mission is to bring personal freedoms and rule of law to Polish lands, the Poles themselves reject us, percieving us with more distrust and hatred than ever before, which means that we cannot count on any support from the commonfolk. The West has also turned its back towards Polish liberals, not wanting to have anything to do with Poland once Morawiecki's government and even the country's populace rejected the European interventionary corps. So stand up, people, for our cause is just, and we have *only ourselves* to do the job. Onwards, for a free Europa!"
eurolib_defensive_war_propaganda:0 "Keep the torch of liberty burning!"
eurolib_defensive_war_propaganda_desc:0 "Forest bandits and nationalist bumfucks are trying their hardest to undermine our goal of building a Polish state that's worth living in. They sacrifice hundreds of human lives and resources to build their personal kingdoms found on principles of corruption and oppresion, and we - as the bearers of the torch of liberty - are their natural adversaries who represent their biggest fears. In the past, we already gave them the access to power once, and now we see the results of that. We cannot let it happen again, so STAND UP, PEOPLE! Stand up for your liberties - for the liberties of your daughters and your wifes! Keep the torch of liberty burning!"

Ahhh... \n...if only we could be as noble as the knights who fought in Grunwald against the treacherous Teutons. As famous and legendary as the Winged Hussars who seized Moscow in 1610. As brave as Kościuszko's scythemen. As fast as the Uhlans who drove the Soviets back to Russia and as patriotic, resilient and heroic as the Polish partisans during the Warsaw uprising. Ah... if only... \n... \n...actually, you know what? Scratch that. We shouldn't just reminiscent about them.

Obviously, increasing our hold over people's lives is gonna make them hate us more, but it will bring us one step closer to establishing our dream neo-feudal state."

corp_expand_security_forces:0 "Offer contracts for temporary army duty"
corp_expand_security_forces_desc:0 "Food security is very low in post-Fall Poland, and there's lots of struggling people who'd be willing to serve in the army in exchange for food and money, but cannot leave their families alone, as then they'd be left without a breadwinner. Therefore - how about we offer these people contracts for *temporary* army duty? The Russian government used a similar method of hiring new people for the army during their invasion of Ukraine, where anyone of working age could simply hit up their local wojenkomat (army drafting commitee, or WKU in Polish) and sign up for service on the front for a limited time. These contract troops would receive their salary only after some time spent on the front, meaning that many of them died without even getting paid, meaning that we can use this conscription method to gain new recruits while simultaneously keeping our money."

corp_encite_military_service:0 "Expand core army parts"
corp_encite_military_service_desc:0 "Our army works the same way the armies of colonial companies did so in the past - it is comprised of levied locals and contracted volunteers commanded over by the core corporate troops. This system ensures that we've always got access to a large manpower pool, but it also creates the need to balance the ratio between the levy and our own men as to not let them outnumber us too much, as that would let 'em easily overwhelm us in a potential rebelion. Let's expand the core rank to ensure that the lower ranks don't suddenly get any funny ideas, like recreating the Sepoy Mutiny for example."
