sell_ranged:0"Sell Old Ranged Weapons"
sell_melee:0"Sell Old Melee Equipment"

buy_german_ranged:0"Buy German Guns"
buy_german_ranged_desc:0 "Ever since the European army halted its advance, the Eurokommissariats have devolved into what is basically a country-sized black market operation, and German guns became a commonly available good or even a currency of sorts. We don't even need to search for any German ex-soldiers or smugglers, we can just hit up any local arms dealer to get our hands on them."  
buy_swedish_ranged:0"Buy Guns from Sweden"
buy_swedish_ranged_desc:0 "Very few Swedish guns have reached Poland due to the Swedish government's surprising reluctance to partake in the European intervention. Their scarcity has given them a certaint status among the populace, however, and the usage of them is seen as both more prestigious in the eyes of gangsters and as more patriotic in the eyes of the commonfolk. Through our connections with the always enigmatic Master Weapon Dealer we can secure a large supply of armament provided by Swedish smugglers for ourselves." 
buy_ukrainian_ranged:0"Strike a Deal with the Ukrainians"
buy_ukrainian_ranged_desc:0 "The Ukrainian Humanitarian Mission in Poland has fallen prey to saboteurs from Rzeszów and Nisko, leaving mostly those with a dubious reputation on our side of the border: nationalist ex-humanitarian workers enraged by Braun's betrayal and refusal of Ukrainian help, humanitarian workers who banded up together with Polish villagers and formed a joint quasi-military government of sorts, the few Ukrainian border guards who still occupy Medyka and gangsters. Gangsters who are more than willing to sell us their old armament, left behind by the Soviet government and the Russian army in 1991 and 2022."
buy_russian_ranged:0"Buy Russian Guns"
buy_russian_ranged_desc:0 "Once Navalny took power in Moscow and started his crusade against the corruption and crime that have been synonymous with the Russian government since times immemorial, many Russkie mafiozos and gangbangers ran abroad, trying to escape his judgement. With no perspectives in life, seemingly left to die in a hostile world, they've been saved by the downfall of the Polish state which allowed them to get back to a life of crime by forming a competition to German arms dealers and even establishing back some of the old connections with pro-Russian Polish political organisations and the remains of the old guard of Russian politics."
buy_radom_ranged:0"Sign an Arms Deal with Radom"
buy_radom_ranged_desc:0 "A real patriot supports domestic products, hence why we should hit up the arms manufacturers in Radom. There's even a certain Polish saying about this: 'cudze chwalicie, swego nie znacie', which roughly translates to 'stop creaming yourself to foreign garbage and start appreciating our own shit instead'."

buy_german_melee:0"Buy German Melee Equipment"
buy_german_melee_desc:0 "The Germans wasted away so much of their own equipment, that now almost everyone in Poland is utilizing some of it on a daily basis. If you ever see some tableware, shovels, picks, fire starting tools or other such items in a Polish household - it's most likely they got that stuff from the Germans."
buy_swedish_melee:0"Buy Melee Equipment from Sweden"
buy_swedish_melee_desc:0 "German equipment, though much easier to acquire, tends to already possess marks of previous usage. Thankfully, if we ever find ourselves in need of factory new equipment, we can hook up our connections in Sweden and get ourselves some brand new Ikea tools and utensils from them."
buy_ukrainian_melee:0"Buy Melee Equipment from the Ukrainians"
buy_ukrainian_melee_desc:0 "Western donations and Russian logistical incompetence have left the Ukrainians with copious amounts of old, mismatched army equipment that is completely useless for a modern army which the Armed Forces of Ukraine is striving to become. There's lots of offers and auctions put up by Ukrainian sellers on the Internet, we just need to find somebody who could smuggle their goods to Poland."
buy_russian_melee:0"Buy Melee Equipment from the Russians"
buy_russian_melee_desc:0 "The Russian army might fail to provide its soldiers with tools and equipment, but there's still plenty of commercial szpej manufacturers and sellers in Russia who'd be willing to supply us with some of their products in exchange for cash and political capital."
buy_radom_melee:0"Buy Radom-Made Melee Equipment"
buy_radom_melee_desc:0 "Even before the Fall, FB Łucznik produced not only guns, but also military-grade equipment such as bayonets, toolboxes and ammo boxes. Nowadays, their offer includes even more types of tools and utensils, since now they're responsible for supplying the army of Radom Republic. While their prices might be higher than those of Russian gangsters or German small-time smugglers, their products are a symbol of respect for those whom we conquer, and most importantly - what we buy from them is made to order, unlike the equipment resold to us by criminals and Internet vendors."

eurolib_pro_federalist_propaganda_desc:0 "Due to Poland's history of foreign occupations, Germanisation and Russification, Poles have adopted a very cautious and conservative approach to foreign ideas and cultural notions, which are immedeatly received by them as invasive and intrusive. We can warm the public eye's image of ourselves through cultural subsidies and development of villages and cities that have been neglected by the previous, conservative regime."

eurolib_taxes_increase:0 "Crank Up Tax Revenues"
eurolib_taxes_increase_desc:0 "A liberal state has to simultaneously fund tons of projects, subsidies and investments as well as the bureaucracy associated with them. And we are slowly running out of funds and resources. Our people will have to bit their lip a bit to fund living conditions worthy of a first world state for themselves."

eurolib_agricultural_funds:0 "Subsidize Agriculture"
eurolib_agricultural_funds_desc:0 "Food is hard to get by nowadays. So are other products and goods. By funding our farmers, we can win the hearts of farmers on our lands and at least slightly increase the availability of food and farm products."

eurolib_public_works_funds:0 "Subsidize Public Works & Projects"
eurolib_public_works_funds_desc:0 "Times are hard. People are either struggling with surviving to the next day, or trying to keep their battered psyche intact. We should fund some public artists and development projects to make the reality they're living in at least a little bit less harsh and drab for them. Small local artisans who decorate houses in traditional ways, new town parks and attractions, improved city infrastructure to make their daily commute a tad more bearable - all those things will help our image and provide our people with something to admire in these bleak times."

eurolib_cultural_dev_funds:0 "Subsidize Artists"
eurolib_cultural_dev_funds_desc:0 "There's much to be gained from funding various types of artists in our lands, from loudspeaking political caricaturists to small local painters, sculptors and artisanal artists. Depending on whom are we subsidizing, we can either discredit our enemies and improve the public's opinion about us, or help out small communities and aspiring artists with sharing their art with the world." 

eurolib_implement_harsher_gun_laws:0 "Enforce Stricter Gun Control"
eurolib_implement_harsher_gun_laws_desc:0 "Even before the Fall, most gun owners in Poland were made out to be weirdos and political radicals who definitely shouldn't be allowed anywhere near firearms. However, now that every larger settlement is at war with their neighbours, this stereotype became truth. Implementing strict gun laws and strongly enforcing them in newly acquired land will not only disarm most potentially dangerous individuals in the area, but also enlarge our own stockpile of weapons."

eurolib_offensive_war_propaganda_desc:0 "Though our mission is to bring personal freedoms and rule of law to Polish lands, the Poles themselves reject us, percieving us with more distrust and hatred than ever before, which means that we cannot count on any support from the commonfolk. The West has also turned its back towards Polish liberals, not wanting to have anything to do with Poland once Morawiecki's government and even the country's populace rejected the European interventionary corps. So stand up, people, for our cause is just, and we have *only ourselves* to do the job. Onwards, for a free Europa!"

They sacrifice hundreds of human lives and resources to build their personal kingdoms found on principles of corruption and oppresion, and we - as the bearers of the torch of liberty - are their natural adversaries who represent their biggest fears. In the past, we already gave them the access to power once, and now we see the results of that. We cannot let it happen again, so STAND UP, PEOPLE! Stand up for your liberties - for the liberties of your daughters and your wifes! Keep the torch of liberty burning!"

As brave as Kościuszko's scythemen. As fast as the Uhlans who drove the Soviets back to Russia and as patriotic, resilient and heroic as the Polish partisans during the Warsaw uprising. Ah... if only... \n... \n...actually, you know what? Scratch that. We shouldn't just reminiscent about them. We should BE like them - because just like the heroes of our past, we're fighting for Poland's survival."

react_warriors_of_great_past_wrt_desc:0 "We can be thankful that the Prussians are no longer here, for if they saw the modern borders of Poland, we'd get our Hinterns spanked by them *to death*. The Poles - as they've done before - are constantly trying to resist and rebel against the German folk who settled back in Schlesien, Posen and Pommern - and given their numbers, they would have a very easy time overwhelming us with sheer numbers... if they knew how to properly organize. Therefore, in order to cement our returned presence in Poland, we need to look for Germans willing to relocate here, take up arms and defend the land that we once already proved to be much more capable of governing."

corp_increase_population_comfort_desc:0 "'Give them bread and circuses and they will never revolt', said Juvenal. His words are to live by for all governments and *especially* for corporate entities like ourselves - numbing down the populace's voice is what we are built upon in the first place.

corp_expand_security_forces:0 "Offer Contracts for Temporary Army Duty"
corp_expand_security_forces_desc:0 "Food security is very low in post-Fall Poland, and there's lots of struggling people who'd be willing to serve in the army in exchange for food and money, but cannot leave their families alone, as then they'd be left without a breadwinner. Therefore - how about we offer these people contracts for *temporary* army duty? The Russian government used a similar method of hiring new people for the army during their invasion of Ukraine, where anyone of working age could simply hit up their local wojenkomat (army drafting commitee, or WKU in Polish) and sign up for service on the front for a limited time. These contract troops would receive their salary only after some time spent on the front, meaning that many of them died without even getting paid, meaning that we can use this conscription method to gain new recruits while simultaneously keeping our money."

This system ensures that we've always got access to a large manpower pool, but it also creates the need to balance the ratio between the levy and our own men as to not let them outnumber us too much, as that would let 'em easily overwhelm us in a potential rebelion.

Though they obviously don't possess the power to threaten us, they still might prove to be thorns in our back if they grow up a little too much and/or start cooperating with various conspirants to undermine our position. Therefore, we should buy them out and incorporate them into our corporate web, forever trapping them inside ourselves."
corpo_monopoles_tt:0 "By integrating these various enterprises into our corporate structure, we also branch out our field of operations on the market, potentially resulting in §Glarge-scale benefits§!.

Well... shit, i-it's not important, people know that we don't really care about them anyway. However, they cannot feel completely abandoned by everyone, as that would extinguish their willingness to fight, for they need *a cause* or *someone* to fight for - even slimy fucks such as ourselves have a cause to fight for, such as upholding religious values. Yes.. we need to entrench religion in our people's hearts - not only for our gain, but also for moral reasons, and for *our survival*, for God is with His humble flock, but those who reject His word end up rotting in Hell."

Now we capitalize on those very people, trying to suck up to them in exchange for their loyalty, and OH BOY is their loyalty profitable for us - if we asked them nicely, they'd give us all their lifesavings and possessions. In fact, using the clergy as henchmen for gathering additional taxes from our loyalists is already common in the our administration, so it's completely fine if we ask them for a handout to cover our army's upkeep - after all, every grosz not spent on our forces is a grosz earned by Germans, Russians and lefties!"

By entrusting the priesthood with control over businesses (both ones of real and of dubious legality), government institutions and various sectors of the economy we can cement our cooperation with it and secure the growth of both their and our coffers."
