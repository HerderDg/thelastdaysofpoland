unification.40.t: "[GetNewspaper]Kingdom of Podhale unifies the Tatry Region"
unification.40.desc: "The mountains return to the rightful grasp of the Highlanders, as for the first time in centuries, not just autonomy, but sovereignty for the Górals becomes a fact. Yet rather than languish in their huts in the footsteps of the Tatras, a greater goal guides them – the restoration of the very same Polish state that once suppressed them. Though they claim above all to represent the increasingly integrated minority’s interests, the position of Góralskie Veto is clear – the destiny of the Highlanders is inevitably tied to that of the Poles. If their patrons perish, so too will they, and thus the shattered nation’s restoration is a matter of utmost importance. Though his more freedom-minded colleagues object to further bloodshed, Pitoń remains determined in his plans to strike north. Should he manage to withstand their discontent, from their pastures, the Górals will undoubtedly march on Kraków with Ciupagas in hand."
unification.40.a: "Though their homeland is restored, the Górals press on"
