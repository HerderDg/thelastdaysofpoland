unification.88.desc:0 "To the disdain of Polish nationalists, the Kashubian people refuse to lay down and die. With the minority tying its fate to that of the German invasion, serving the occupiers as a thoroughly dependent Freistaat, it seemed that the collapse of foreign authority all around the nation was the death knell for Kashubia, as its people found themselves divided in a struggle between the previous administration and an increasingly fiery clique of anti-Polish supremacists. Instead, the resolve of the loyalists prevailed, as all dangers to their survival have now been eliminated from the voivodeship. Against the tide of increasingly hostile rhetoric furthering the divide between the two nations, the emerging state attempts to create a truly multicultural society in which both Kashub and Pole can live together in peace. So far, the recent conflicts have demonstrated the fruitlessness of their attempts, but with their authority now squarely asserted, perhaps a country of equals is closer to reality than previously believed."
