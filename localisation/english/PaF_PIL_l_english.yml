unification.53.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Piła Consortium unifies Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.53.desc: "Wielkopolska shudders in horror as a once-familiar face returns with a lust for vengeance. An army of butchers and hunters, wicked and filled with a bloodlust, brought terror and destruction to the northern region. Henryk Kania’s revenge is brutal, with unspeakable acts committed against those who opposed him, with special torture reserved for those responsible for his fall; ten years of wrath unleashed at once. Life isn’t much better for the common people either. Enjoying little to no rights, existing purely to fuel the system, they can only hope that when the meat runs out in the forests of Poland, the hunters don’t turn them into their new product. Though, weirdly, after every battle won by the consortium and each round of executions of their enemies, the meat does always seem to taste kind of funny."
unification.53.a: "At night, you can hear the forests scream"

unification.152.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Piła Consortium unifies Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.152.desc: "Henryk Kania’s insanity has come to an end. While the new government in power in Northern Wielkopolska isn’t necessarily one focused on the wellbeing of the people, still being a ruthless corporatist regime, the inhabitants of the region nevertheless breathe a sigh of relief. At least they’ll have to fear for their lives no longer. Onto the stage steps Henryk Stokłosa, who no matter the extent of his corrupt dealings will always be remembered by his people as a savior who brought the tyrant down. And they repaid him greatly, enlisting en-masse to aid him in the rebellion against both the German forces, as well as other warlords. Bolstered greatly by this support, the forces of Piła marched all the way to Poznań, pacifying the metropolis. The people’s gratitude doesn’t last forever, though, and unless he starts implementing their will, Stokłosa might soon find himself facing their wrath."
unification.152.a: "Sic semper tyrannis"
