unification.53.t: "[GetNewspaper]Piła Consortium unifies Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.53.desc: "Greater Poland shudders in horror as a once-familiar face returns, the desire for vengeance weaving its corrupt influence around him. An army of butchers and hunters, wicked and filled with bloodlust, brought terror and destruction to the northern region. Henryk Kania's retribution is brutal, with unspeakable acts committed against those who previously opposed him and special torture reserved for those responsible for his fall; ten years of wrath unleashed at once. However, life isn't much better for the common people either. Enjoying little to no rights, existing solely to fuel the system, they can only hope that when the meat runs out in the forests of Poland, the hunters don't turn them into their new product instead. Though, weirdly, after every battle won by the consortium and each of the frequent rounds of executions carried out on its enemies, the meat does always seem to taste kind of funny."
unification.53.a: "At night, you can hear the forests scream."

unification.152.t: "[GetNewspaper]Piła Consortium unifies Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.152.desc: "Henryk Kania's insanity has come to an end. While the new government in power in Northern Greater Poland isn't necessarily one focused on the wellbeing of the people, still being a ruthless, barely-disguised corporatist regime, the inhabitants of the region nevertheless breathe a sigh of relief. At least they'll have to fear for their lives no longer. Onto the stage steps Henryk Stokłosa, who, no matter the extent of his corrupt dealings, will always be remembered by his people as a savior who brought the tyrant down. And they repaid him greatly, enlisting en-masse to aid him in the rebellion against not just the German forces but also the multitude of warlords claiming the region. Bolstered greatly by this support, the forces of Piła marched all the way to the voivodeship capital of Poznań, pacifying the metropolis and quashing any immediate opposition. The people's gratitude doesn't last forever, though, and unless he starts implementing their will, Stokłosa might soon find himself facing their wrath."
unification.152.a: "Sic semper tyrannis"

super.53.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.53.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.53.a: "United at last."
