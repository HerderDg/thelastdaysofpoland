unification.97.t: "[GetNewspaper]Warmia unifies Warmia and Masuria!"
unification.97.desc: "When the Kaliningrad leftovers of Putin's regime crossed the border to invade Warmia-Masuria it was predicted by most that they would have been eventually pushed back as soon as any Polish government managed to reorganize itself, after all, their military 'might' was put on full display in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\nWhat wasn't predicted by most though, was that Warmia's eventual liberators would be Taliban veterans and middle eastern migrants under the command of a former member of the EU parliament. Sikorski's Republic of Warmia has as of today proclaimed their overlordship over former Warmia-Masuria after a string of victories against their (presumably just as insane) rivals and Russian invaders. Many still wonder how a warband of Muslims led by a Muslim convert managed to establish itself in one of the most Catholic societies in Europe, these questions have so far been answered with 'The will of Allah' by the more theologically involved of the Republic."

unificationreg.97.desc: "The whole region of Al-Prussiya is under our control! Banners of the Prophet fly sky-high on every building and street corner, and our brave Mujahideen fighters of Warmianistan already took to celebrating our victory in the streets. We say our most heartfelt salah for their victims.\n\nNow, it's time to consolidate our territories, root out any heresies that spit in the face of Allah and proceed forward. For just as the Prophet united the warring tribes of Arabia, our great leader Radosław Sikorski shall unite the warring tribes of Poland!"

The final battle over the control of the Polish nation begins today. With the power of Allah wielded by our venerable Caliph Sikorski, the warriors of Islam are invincible!\n\nThe final battle is upon us!"
