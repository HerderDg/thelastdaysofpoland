unification.39.desc:0 "A motorcade of technicals filled to the brim with armed bandits and brass bands has been spotted rolling from Żywiec to Bielsko-Biała among deafening noise of gunshots and folk music. It was led by a monster truck „Bernadetka” manned by two Golec brothers, the leaders of a notorious bandit group that has apparently placed whole Podhale under their heels. \n\nHaving united the Górals throughout ruthless raids and robberies, it is unclear whether the band will be able to sustain it’s further existence and expansion in the same manner. The leaderships seems to be conflicted on the subject. External observers have noted one brother proclaming the band will improve their armed prowess and focus on control through sheer might, while others have heard one of the Golec discussing the possibility of large-scale reforms in the spirit of extreme liberalism and free marketism. As for now, analitics are occupied with discerning one Golec from another."
