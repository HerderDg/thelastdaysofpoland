unification.24.t: "[GetNewspaper]Gliwice unify Upper Silesia!"
unification.24.desc: "Not everything that is written is true, but for Szczepan Twardoch, it might as well be. Or at least that's what he wished it would be. Despite this, Twardoch definitely became the most popular Silesian writer, but he decided to turn this popularity into political capital, out of hatred for the political entity called the Third Republic of Poland.\n\nThe shafts of the *Silesian* mines resounded with a thunderous roar as the *Silesian* nation threw off its shackles, but not everyone was happy about it. Those who were, pffft, Polish could only rejoice at the thought of the upcoming forced trip to the mine. Especially now, when the *Silesian* poet has come to lead the entire Metropolis, he must decide whether he wants to be a despot persecuting everything that is Polish, or whether he will decide to build a bridge to reconcile the two feuding nations and the historical Polish-Silesian union."
unification.24.a: "JADYMY DURŚ!"

super.24.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.24.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.24.a: "United at last."
