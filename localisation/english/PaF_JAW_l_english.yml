unification.16.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Antifa Jaworzno unifies Zagłębie and Jura!"
unification.16.desc:0 "Fascism has not passed. In fact, Antifa Jaworzno had to venture into the farthest depths of Zagłębie and Jura in search of it. They did not find much, but what they managed to do was enough to declare a great triumph of anti-fascist action. Great pride parades took place in the streets of all conquered cities, and at the largest of them in Jaworzno, the Anti-Fascist Council spoke to the gathered about their further plans. They will certainly not rest until all Poles are liberated and incorporated into their anarchist communes and Poland itself is cleansed of all manifestations of fascism.\n\nPeople in the region have not yet fully adapted to the new reality, where there is no state apparatus, they are confused about what to do and do not understand what the anarcho-communist idea is all about. In addition, fear has fallen on them of Antifa militants who repeatedly provoke aggressive clashes with the local population, accusing them of fascist behavior. Will they be able to keep this "great" utopia?"
