 POLITICS_JACEK_SASIN_DESC: "Jacek Sasin claimed he would organize envelope elections for 70 million złoty. \n\nHe said that the 2025 elections were perfectly free and just. \n\nHe claimed that unrest would go away in about a week. \n\nHe dismissed with laughter the possibility of EU intervention. \n\nHe argued that the nuclear explosion in Poland is pure fantasy. \n\nHe boasted Warsaw barricades are tough enough to hold off any attacker. \n\nHe promised he’ll take Jarosław Kaczyński to a place where he would be safe and sound. \n\nNow Sasin is hiding in Ciechanów, having fled Morawiecki’s government. There, to make a semblance of legal authority, he was made Protector of Northern Mazovia. It would be an over-exaggeration to claim that anyone expects much from him. However, Sasin’s morale is as strong as ever. He briskly began to work, and despite overflowing with optimism, he stated his personal opinion humbly: he won’t be the one to unite Poland again. \n\n§RMay he for once be right§!."

unification.55.t: "[GetNewspaper]Sasin's Government unifies North Mazovia!"
unification.55.desc: "A gasp of disbelief and apprehension rolls through the country after the government in Ciechanów began streaming an empty stage in the city park with a banner above it proclaiming 'Reunification of Northern Mazovia Region.' After approximately half an hour, the stream was raided and subsequently taken down, but the message remained. As merely a splinter of the remnant government, Jacek Sasin’s authority wasn’t predicted to last long. However, due to some trick of fate, it survived the onslaught of all the other statelets, perhaps only because they did not expect any sort of threat on its part. Some former opponents have since reevaluated what they thought about Sasin and admitted, albeit reluctantly, that he proved a shrewd and cunning politician. As eyes turn to Ciechanów, there has been further confusion as Sasin ceased correspondence with the other warlords. Trusted sources claim he halted the flow of letters after almost signing a document that proved an act of annexation by the Czech Republic."
unification.55.a: "70 million spent, right...?"

super.55.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.55.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.55.a: "United at last."
