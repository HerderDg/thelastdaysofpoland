 POLITICS_JACEK_SASIN_DESC:0 "Jacek Sasin claimed he would organize envelope elections for 70 million złoty. \n\nHe said that the 2025 elections were perfectly free and just. \n\nHe claimed that unrest would go away in about a week. \n\nHe dismissed with laughter the possibility of EU intervention. \n\nHe argued that the nuclear explosion in Poland is pure fantasy. \n\nHe boasted Warsaw barricades are tough enough to hold off any attacker. \n\nHe promised he’ll take Jarosław Kaczyński to a place where he would be safe and sound. \n\nNow Sasin is hiding in Ciechanów, having fled Morawiecki’s government. There, to make a semblance of legal authority, he was made Protector of Northern Mazovia. It would be an over-exaggeration to claim that anyone expects much from him. However, Sasin’s morale is as strong as ever. He briskly began to work, and despite overflowing with optimism, he stated his personal opinion humbly: he won’t be the one to unite Poland again. \n\n§RMay he for once be right§!."
