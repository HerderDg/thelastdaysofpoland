 POLITICS_JACEK_SASIN_DESC:0 "Jacek Sasin claimed he would organise envelope elections for 70 million złoty. \n\nHe said that 2025 elections were perfectly free and just. \n\nHe claimed that unrest would expire in about a week. \n\nHe dismissed with laughter the possibility of EU intervention. \n\nHe argued that nuclear explosion in Poland is a fantasy scenario. \n\nHe boasted Warsaw barricades are tough enough to hold off any attacker. \n\nHe promised he’ll take Jarosław Kaczyński to a place where he would be safe and sound. \n\nNow Sasin is hiding in Ciechanów, having fled Morawiecki’s government. There, to make a semblance of legal authority, he has been made Protector of Northern Mazovia. It would be an over-exaggeration to claim no one expects much from him. However, Sasin’s morale is as strong as ever. He briskly begun to work, and despite overflowing with optimism, his states his personal opinion humbly: he won’t be the one to unite Poland again. \n\n§RMay he for once be right§!."
