 DGR_faction_desc: "Securing power in the city wasn't as easy as it was in General Secretary's mind. Dozens of minor factions were squabbling between themselves after the Fall, fighting for scraps of once prosperous city in the region. Most of them were simply gangs and raiders, but there are also some ideological groups of fanatics. Remnants of Dąbrowa Górnicza local parliament were disbanded and forced to flee before some bandits could hang them up on the nearest lantern. They've found a shelter in Katowice Steelworks, biggest complex of this kind in the whole Poland. But factory was already controlled by Communist Party of Poland, and so they unexpectedly have gained a leadership over Dąbrowa's legitimate government, and it was up to them to bring order in the city."

 DGR_OL_instigate_workers_desc: "Coke Plant 'Przyjaźń' (polish for 'Friendship') is the second-largest facility of this type in Poland. The workforce there will definitely align with our side if we can encourage them...appropriately."
 DGR_OL_convoy_to_cargo: "Send armored convoy to PKP Cargo"
 DGR_OL_convoy_to_cargo_desc: "PKP Cargo in Strzemieszyce is a very important freight hub for supplies; we can't just leave it in the hands of the rebels. Fortunately, the railway from Huta Katowice leads straight to the station. All we need to do is send them a Trojan train."
 DGR_OL_cutoff_s1: "Cut off the S1 Expressway"
 DGR_OL_cutoff_s1_desc: "The S1 Expressway cuts through our city in half, with us effectively separated from the main urban area. Moreover, by controlling the interchange at Sulno, we will be able to follow National Road 94 through all of Strzemieszyce. And if we happen to gain control of the micro-steel mill and fuel tanks in the process? All the better."
 DGR_OL_march_on_basilica: "March on Strzemieszyce Basilica"
 DGR_OL_march_on_basilica_desc: "It's time to settle the score with the rebels from the Strzemieszyce People's Republic. Let our popular action be the final act in the history of Strzemieszyce separatism and put an end, once and for all, to their dreams of seceding from Dąbrowa Górnicza!"
 DGR_OL_disband_organisations: "Disband social and political organizations"
 DGR_OL_disband_organisations_desc: "Each of the rebels will be brought before a people's court and will not escape punishment. All non-communist organizations will be immediately dissolved by decree, and their members sent for compulsory reeducation. Such is the will of the people."
 DGR_OL_emergency_conscription: "Emergency conscription of Strzemieszyce workers"

 DGR_OW_cutoff_euroterminal_desc: "Following the railway tracks from Strzemieszyce, we can effectively split the rebellious Sławków Republic in half, allowing us to divert their attention and undoubtedly create chaos among their ranks. What will they defend more vigorously: the city or the Euroterminal?"
 DGR_OW_send_armored_convoys: "Send armored convoys to the city"
 DGR_OW_send_armored_convoys_desc: "National Road 94 leads us straight through the heart of Sławków. Convenient, isn't it? All we need to do is send a few armored vehicles down this road to take control of the entire city. There will be no resistance"
 DGR_OW_arrest_separatists: "Arrest separatist leaders"
 DGR_OW_arrest_separatists_desc: "Sławków reactionary bandits, only mistakenly referred to as an army, fled to the Euroterminal, leaving the city to its fate.

 DGR_OW_teach_them_lesson: "Teach them a lesson"
 DGR_OW_teach_them_lesson_desc: "The assault on the Euroterminal may prove to be a bloody undertaking. But this blood is necessary for the rebuilding of our city; the wealth amassed there will allow us to rise from our knees, and unlocking the freight route will finally enable our development.

 DGR_forgotten_city: "Forgotten City"
 DGR_forgotten_city_desc: "You could ask a random person about Dąbrowa Górnicza, and they won’t point out its location. At most, they might mention something about an orgy at the parish house. We are forgotten by God, and he’s what’s most missing in the Red Basin. Instead we have him. President Marcin Bazylak. In the face of a crumbling state, he crumbles the most. He didn’t even try to save the situation as it completely overwhelmed him. The formal alliance with Sosnowiec and the other cities in the region was forced upon him, and he had no say in it. Not that it would help him. He sits locked in his city hall like King Popiel in his tower.\n\nAnd the mice and rats are coming. Dąbrowa will be taken over by the law of the jungle, and the strongest tribe will take it all."
 DGR_last_man_standing: "Last Man Standing" 
 DGR_last_man_standing_desc: "Fantastic. Everything went according to plan. Control over the city hall doesn’t mean control over the city, but it’s just the first piece of the puzzle. The Palace of Culture, Katowice Steelworks, PKP Cargo. Strategic infrastructural, administrative, and cultural nodes. This is the key to complete control over the city. Even one as unruly as Dąbrowa. The only problem might be clearing huge swaths of land that we simply don’t have enough people to control.\n\nSend tanks to the Steelworks! Just like in the good old days."
 DGR_sztygarka_robbery: "Robbery at the Sztygarka Museum"
 DGR_sztygarka_robbery_desc: "In the very center of the city sits a perfect Trojan horse, ready to be used by those daring enough to aim high. And that’s exactly what we will do. Tanks. Transporters. Museum weapons, old but still functional. And since there’s a gas station on the way with some fuel left... I’ll only need a few good men.\n\nAnd we’ll go on a trip. We’ll visit Mr. President. And he will agree to everything we put in front of him. Why? Let’s say we’ll have very strong arguments."
 DGR_weeds_to_eradicate: "Weeds to Eradicate"
 DGR_weeds_to_eradicate_desc: "KURWA. It should have turned out differently. I underestimated the deadly spirit of this city, which is constantly ready to self-destruct rather than cooperate. So, we lost everything. Well, almost. We managed to escape with a handful of our people to Łęknice, where our last major base is located. Our fortune will change soon. How could it not, since power in the city has been given to Joseph Stalin’s Supreme Geriatric Council? Bazylak really hit his head when he fell out of that tram. Handing over power to the communists is a brilliant shot in the foot. Moreover, they are surrounded on all sides by hostile gangs and partisans. And we are one of them.\n\nOnce we rebuild our strength and destroy them, we’ll still have to deal with the separatists from Strzemieszyce and Sławków. They hate our city so much they are ready to see it burn. Not on our watch. Even if we have to team up with the red devil against the traitors of Dąbrowa unity!"
 DGR_uneasy_peace: "Uneasy Peace"
 DGR_uneasy_peace_desc: "Big fucking surprise you’re all hanging out together, you’re all fucked in the head. A rastafarian, a PiS deputy, a leftist, a retired doctor, and a communist. Lumpenproletariat to the fullest. This so-called “People’s Front” will fall apart from within sooner than it will be able to defeat anyone outside. Better for us. In that case, returning to power and full strength is a matter of weeks, not months. We need to be ready when the reds start tearing each other apart for the last scraps of the city. Of course, as long as grandpa Szwej doesn’t forget where he is and why he’s there."
 DGR_wrong_neighborhood: "Wrong Neighbourhood"
 DGR_wrong_neighborhood_desc: "Fucking ghetto. No wonder Bazylak didn’t want to do anything. It was harmful, but definitely smarter than stirring up the hornet's nest. Sztygars, Pharaohs, Feta Kings, gangs from Gołonóg. They are all a degenerate bunch with a negative IQ and an overgrown cult of violence! Only the ŁI has the moral high ground here. And thanks to our faith in our values, soon at the steelworks it will be better to be dead than red..."
 DGR_troublesome_alliance: "Troublesome Alliance"
 DGR_troublesome_alliance_desc: "Bazylak is going to Sosnowiec. I don’t know why? To pay feudal homage to the great strategist and ‘uncle’ of the Polish leftists? After all, Czarzasty is the greatest right-wing patriot of the entire Republic, no one has destroyed left-wing movements and party structures on the left side of the barricade as well as he has. I say let him go. Even Czarzasty, despite his ineptitude in recognizing that it’s already the 21st century, won’t be stupid enough to get involved in any help for the lost cause that Bazylak presents. Especially since he is now working for Szwej, and he has similar grudges against Czarzasty as every straight thinking person on the left side. I won’t even mention Jaworzno, giving any attention to those bandits is a crime against common sense."
 DGR_supress_dissent: "Supress Dissent"
 DGR_supress_dissent_desc: "Something festers in the middle of the Katowice Steelworks. Something that we have failed to see. Intelligence reports that our beloved People’s Front is gathering strength and is on the brink of launching a special military operation. We must prepare for the eventual repulsion of their invasion into our controlled districts. The problem is, they could go in any direction, and we don’t know what’s happening in that communist hole.\n\nThe closed gates of the Steelworks will open once again. The red flood that will pour over the entire city must be stopped. But their numbers make it likely that it will only be a small rain rather than a flood."
 DGR_central_planning_commision: "Central Planning Commision"
 DGR_central_planning_commision_desc: "Our industry has died and now it stinks. Oh, wait. It’s just the standard smells coming from the steelworks. The industrial plants in the city have shut down along with the rest of the country. The decaying carcass of the Dąbrowa economy is a testament of this city itself. At least the sky has become somewhat bluer. If only people weren’t dying of hunger, this might be a plus. Apparently, a Central Planning Commission has been established to revive the economic power of the heart of the Zagłębie\n\nBrick by brick, machine by machine, the spirit of people’s thrift will be used to produce 200% of the norm, in exchange for hunger rations just to fuel the communists' war efforts. But soon we will be back at the top of the rankings. Of cities with the highest air pollution…"
 DGR_restore_palace_of_culture: "Restore Palace of Culture"
 DGR_restore_palace_of_culture_desc: "Zagłębie’s Palace of Culture. The impaired younger brother of Warsaw’s Palace of Culture, a mediocre caricature of what was supposed to be a powerful cultural symbol of the region but became just a black hole absorbing millions for renovations. Another great renovation is ahead. The communists, taking over the center, will want to complete the vision of our graciously reigning ex-president Bazylak and make the Palace of Culture a true government center.\n\nIn fact, it’s not such a stupid idea. If it were transformed into a likeness of the Presidential Palace, it could serve as a strong symbol of the city’s power and its reborn glory. Except that Szwej couldn’t sit there... Even Jimmy Hendrix sitting next to the palace in Freedom Square can see that he’s not leader material deserving of such a grand palace."
 DGR_undermine_drug_dealers: "Destroy Drug Dealing Operations"
 DGR_undermine_drug_dealers_desc: "When your family home is snatched from your hands and taken over by a gang of criminal degenerates, certain principles cease to matter. In this case, maybe the enemy of my enemy is not entirely my friend, but I can only tell them one thing - BURN THIS PLAGUE TO THE GROUND.\n\nReden is one of the districts most infected with the virus of deviant crime. Only the northern areas of Gołonóg with Spisak and Łączna streets together with Mydlice can directly compete with Reden in the category of “districts where you don’t want to live.” I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m glad the People’s Front “liberated” Reden, even if only temporarily. There’s a fraction of hope that these areas will experience the long-awaited and deserved peace without major battles in Haller’s Park or dealers from Orzeszkowa street lurking on every corner."
 DGR_raise_popular_militias: "Raise Popular Militias"
 DGR_raise_popular_militias_desc: "No one wants to die for the red dream. Volunteers here are as rare as hen’s teeth, as we have learned ourselves. And what can the communists say? Like it or not, they have to start recruiting. But how? Encouraging people to flee to the Steelworks. But with what? Fruit Thursdays? A solid paycheck? Tons of crude steel from the steelworks? The communist revolution? They might try to call up the steelworkers, but there aren’t many left. Their only way out will be forcibly enlisting ordinary citizens. Good luck bringing them from areas controlled by gangs. We must be doubly vigilant so that agents of the revolution don’t roam our lands, stealing our people. Once upon a time, black Volgas were real boogeymen... the world has moved forward but not the communist parties. Only the car models have changed."
 DGR_przyjazn_coking_plant: "Restore 'Przyjaźń' Coking Plant"
 DGR_przyjazn_coking_plant_desc: "Once the most modern coking plant in the country. Then taken over by the bean counters of Jastrzębie Coal Company. The country has fallen, but the corporate rats still operate in the plant. Whoever takes over this area will have quite a hard nut to crack, mostly because the coking plant is in a state of decay. But if it could be restored to full functionality - it would fuel our economy immensely. Among the smoke and pyrolysis, the main foundation of the city's economy will arise. Once again. The name of it still bothers me, though."
 DGR_tucznawa_zone: "Tucznawa Investition Zone"
 DGR_tucznawa_zone_desc: "Dąbrowa is very spacious. After all, it was once the 9th largest city in Poland for a reason. But of course, Gdynia and Świnoujście claimed the sea as a city land, and we fell to 11th place. Nothing lost, this will change soon. Shipyard workers cannot compete with steelworkers. But back to the point - we have a lot of land to manage. That is why, for several years, a huge investment zone has been designated in Tucznawa to be filled with various industrial plants. These areas will be the perfect complement to the iron core of the city's economy."
 DGR_dzierzynski_steelworks: "Renovate Dzierżyński Steelworks"
 DGR_dzierzynski_steelworks_desc: "Bank Steelworks. Now it is a shithole, but under communism, it was a magnificent factory. No wonder they decided to return to its former name - Feliks Dzierżyński Steelworks. It is not as large and efficient as Katowice Steelworks, but its history dates back to the times when cannons for the January insurgents were forged there. Cieszkowski was on point with those guns. He knew how to make good use of the potential of this plant. Even the Nazis, who during the war assembled their tanks like Panthers, Tigers, and even parts for V1 and V2 rockets there, appreciated it. Interesting... maybe some archival technical documents could be found there..."
 DGR_monuments_of_old_times: "Desert Trip"
 DGR_monuments_of_old_times_desc: "Everyone really thinks that Błędów and the Błędów Desert are one and the same. The truth is, the name comes from this place, but only a small, heavily forested piece is within the city's borders. The rest is already in Lesser Poland. Fortunately, the Ziobrists don't go to the desert, so the gang called the Pharaohs operates in areas larger than any other. But it would be more than enough to drive into Błędów with an old tank for them to capitulate. I don't think they would even resist. They're just there for show, nothing more."
 DGR_rastafarian_question: "Rastafarian Question"
 DGR_rastafarian_question_desc: "Eating, drinking, smoking joints. Dancing, revelry, and frolic. And this is not a scene from Adam Mickiewicz but the situation in Zielona Park, where a real Rastafarian commune has emerged. It's hard to even call them a gang... because they just sit there and basically don't compete with anyone. Probably because they are constantly high. Plus, the blessing of People's Front Minister Damian Krępa means they enjoy government protection. They are harmless in their activities. If we leave them there, they won't even know what's going on around them. Only God knows if they are even aware that Poland no longer exists. Well, we could also just scatter them and none would be the wiser..."
 DGR_undermine_opposition: "Root Out Separatist Movements"
 DGR_undermine_opposition_desc: "Traitors, traitors, all of them traitors! Not only was Sławków once part of Dąbrowa Górnicza, but they apparently didn't like it so much that they decided to secede and join Będzin County, which they don't even border! Their impudence knows no bounds. Now, when they have once again become part of our great city - they have again caused a rift in unity and rebelled. Additionally, they have infected the residents of Strzemieszyce with their separatist virus. Every independence activist must pay for their crimes. Every whisper of freedom should be drowned in blood. Enough of the dreamers' fantasies. We are all Dąbrowians."
 DGR_every_worker_a_soldier: "Every Worker a Soldier"
 DGR_every_worker_a_soldier_desc: "Young Steelworkers. Another stain on the city map that is only suitable for disposal in the blast furnace no. 2 at the Steelworks. But apparently, according to the communists, everyone is a potential carrier of the revolution. Sounds contagious indeed. Ząbkowice has always been a hotel for workers who worked in nearby plants, and not much has changed. Only I wonder - if you call up workers as soldiers... who will work in these plants to produce equipment for the soldiers? Something doesn't add up, Comrade Szwej."
 DGR_negotiate_with_li: "Negotiate with ŁI"
 DGR_negotiate_with_li_desc: "When in fear, God is dear. The People's Front officially wants to negotiate with us. Mainly because the young squatters from Ząbkowice do not share their outdated point of view. Hell has truly frozen over. Someone trusted the horseshoe theory as the ideal way out of their problems too much. I won't say nationalism in both cases is not similar...and…no, it's a betrayal. But... maybe? Maybe this is the chance? To participate in forming a new Dąbrowian government, transforming the city in our image and likeness. We would have the opportunity to achieve the influence we originally lacked. And when the right moment comes - blow up the system from within and reign unchallenged. It is a tough nut to crack because with each passing moment, I see more and more sense in this madness. Only how to convince my people that this is the way?"
 DGR_heavy_machinery_production: "Gangers into Militias"
 DGR_heavy_machinery_production_desc: "What is the difference between a gangster and a soldier? Mainly the equipment. Well, in the case of communist militias, the only difference is that they are led by ideological officers, not the biggest thug in the neighborhood who dares to call himself the big boss. But even the best officer is useless when he has idiots from the ghetto under his command, whose only skill is to assault an old lady in a group of five. Because if someone shows up who can stand up to them, then the boys will run for the hills!\n\nThey need firm officers with an iron hand and iron will who can make men out of these gangsters. Otherwise, I don't see any grand victories for this army for quite some time."
 DGR_katowice_steelworks: "Complete Restoration of Katowice Steelworks"
 DGR_katowice_steelworks_desc: "Katowice Steelworks has transformed from a collapsing post-fall industrial plant into the center of armed revolution. Now that the whole city is relatively peaceful, this giant must be restored to its nominal processing power. The communists can leave, and the workers return to work. Furnaces and chimneys must be renovated. Rolling mills repaired. The power plant integrated into the municipal network. Conveyor belts restarted. There is much to be done to make Dąbrowa's pride the most powerful industrial plant in the country again. Exactly. Dąbrowa's. Katowice should disappear from the name. We shouldn't give the Silesians any reasons to be proud.\n\nEvery builder of the renewed Huta Katowice will be a pioneer of success. But to achieve this... SHUT UP AND WORK OVERTIME!"
 DGR_our_position: "Our Position in Dąbrowa Basin"
 DGR_our_position_desc: "Bazylak got us into this sick alliance. Come on, Marcin - it’s going to fucking explode. If leftists hate anything more than rightists, it's other leftists whose ideology differs even a little. Antifa, socialists, communists, anarchists. Only one of these ideas will ultimately triumph, and the rest will have to be turned to dust. Not to mention that there are other nationalists in the north. And Ziobro, even though he got hit in his balls once and has his own problems now, he still remains an unpredictable entity. We can only rely on ourselves. Which is ironic because I can't even trust other members of the government. But we play with the cards we've been dealt."
 DGR_nationalist_communist_paramilitary: "Natonalist-Communist Paramilitary"
 DGR_nationalist_communist_paramilitary_desc: "It happened. The official signing of the nationalist-communist alliance. Our units will maintain complete autonomy within the newly created National People's Army. Szwej turned out to be weak, agreeing to most of our demands. Normally I would see this as a trick or a stratagem, but I can recognize when someone has insincere intentions. Here, all I saw was desperation. Democrats will not follow the old order. The modern left won't either. This city is thoroughly sick. And we are the only cure.\n\nNow everyone will know the price of messing with us. Our stark resolve will revive the spirit of Dąbrowian people thanks to our methods. Soon enough we shall be in charge of the whole National People’s Army. Oh, how they will all weep then. Political ideology won’t matter when you have the strength of a grand army to back you up."
 DGR_congress_of_bedzin: "Congress of Będzin"
 DGR_congress_of_bedzin_desc: "What I feared may come to pass sooner than I expected. The second Congress of Intercounty will take place in Będzin. Everyone will be there with their most important dignitaries. I will not be sidelined, I must have a place in the Dąbrowian delegation. Not that I plan something very funny. But I would very much like to see the faces of Czarzasty, Żukowska, and Konieczny when they realize who is sitting on the other side of the table. Although on the other hand, 50 hours of boring bullshit containing the imperative of equality and the socialist idea makes me nauseous already. If the Intercounty somehow survives, we must take as much as possible for ourselves. \n\nIf not… good riddance."
 DGR_industrial_heart: "Industrial Heart of Zagłębie"
 DGR_industrial_heart_desc: "Finally, all elements of the industrial puzzle have been united into one steel fist. The reborn heart of Zagłębie beats to the rhythm of progress. Among machines, smoke, and steel, the entire economic power of Dąbrowa Górnicza works for the benefit of the nation. The Dąbrowian nation. We are the custodians of industrialization and pioneers of the revolution. This force cannot be stopped anymore. With each successive completed workers' plan, the army and society grow in wealth.\n\nNow we must focus all our productive power on one goal. War is coming. The lightning is red, the hammer will forge an iron sword. The National People's Army is the child of the power of Dąbrowa's heavy industry. And thanks to these plants, the rest of Poland will feel what Zagłębie Dąbrowskie is capable of."
 DGR_aftermath: "Aftermath"
 DGR_aftermath_desc: "I can’t say that I did not expect this. However, the intensity of the socialist outcry that took place in the final hours of the congress in Będzin exceeded my wildest expectations. Traitors of the revolution, Nazis in red robes, sellouts, brown fascists, useful PiS idiots, volksdeutsche, smiling clowns. The list of invectives that all sides threw at each other was enormous. And all this in a few minutes during the last meeting. We were on the verge of an agreement. We were this close. But the masks finally fell off, and no one hid the fact that we despise each other.\n\nIntercounty is a dead corpse on which crows and ravens will feed. The time of war conflagration has come. There is no turning back from this path. Time for action."
 DGR_glory_parade: "Rose Alley Parade"
 DGR_glory_parade_desc: "Our combat value may be negligible, but at least we can march proudly. This is also a symbol of hope for the city's population. Hope that there finally exists a formation that will defend their lives. Even if in its ranks are those who not long ago would gladly take that life from them. Never mind. Guarded by disciplined officers, the soldiers will be obedient because that is the only thing they are morally capable of. You only need to be more menacing than their previous gang leaders; the mere power of authority will do the rest. Such a mixture, seasoned with the latest military vehicles freshly released by the Dąbrowa steel mills, will march today along Rose Alley towards the city center to pledge loyalty to the People's Front in front of the Palace of Culture. If only these idiots do not trip over their own feet."
 DGR_working_people: "For the Working People!"
 DGR_working_people_desc: "I never thought I would ever be an advocate of working-class pride. But at a time when it is so closely intertwined with the military and nationalist spirit, I am able to undertake a few rhetorical liberties. Whatever one might say about the communists – the working class must be properly nurtured because it constitutes the core of every well-functioning state. And we fight for a better tomorrow especially for them. Because if the working class is taken care of, so will the families they work to provide. And from there, it's just a short step to a happy society."
 DGR_emergency_mobilization: "Emergency Mobilization"
 DGR_emergency_mobilization_desc: "War in the metropolis will be quite specific. Already at this moment, we can see the troops of our new opponents on the other side of some streets. Mydlice will be a very critical point; we must conduct a very strong mobilization there. After all, people do not have to fight for the idea of communism if they can fight for their home and the safety of their families. This will certainly work. In other areas, we are separated by large forested terrains like Zielona Park or Zagórze Forest. This will allow for some tactical freedom...but we still need to recruit everyone capable of defending our reborn home."
 DGR_war_communism: "War Communism"
 DGR_war_communism_desc: "Solving our problems will not be easy, so temporarily we must undertake certain measures. Of course only for the duration of the war. No one expects it to last long, so they will grit their teeth and meekly comply. Oh...if only they knew they were going into a total war. All plants work at 200% capacity to fulfill all orders for the army. We will need 300% if we are to fight multiple opponents simultaneously. We must squeeze the last drop of sweat from every small workshop. Only overwhelming force and a crushing blow will allow us to emerge from this chaos unscathed. And since the army will now be the main decider of the state's fate, comrade Szwej doesn’t need to be so aware of many things.\n\nAll power to the army. This is where the fun begins..."
 DGR_popular_army: "For the Popular Army!"
 DGR_popular_army_desc: "With the constant influx of fresh recruits, we can slowly phase out the criminal elements in favor of the youth, who are perfectly suited to building an army that believes in its ideals. National ideals. And we will be the sculptors who will shape them into perfect soldiers fulfilling the moral imperative of the revolution. But not necessarily a socialist revolution. Not in its strict sense. The political brass may be socialist, but we are the element that will bring victory for our homeland. And they will all depend on us for securing the future. And that future will not be populist. It will be national-populist!"
 DGR_to_arms_comrades: "To Arms Comrades!"
 DGR_to_arms_comrades_desc: "One might want to hum "Arise, you wretched of the earth," but it seems they sing that in Sosnowiec. At least, sometimes you can hear it from their soldiers stationed in Zagórze. The pawns are positioned on the board, and each of us waits to see who will make the first move. In this duel of gunslingers, however, we must be wise. If we strike first, it may turn out that a third party will strike us at the worst possible moment. Dear officers, you must be clever and cunning. We have the most territory to cover, but we must turn this into our advantage, as maneuverability will be the key. Striking strategic points and cutting crucial communication nodes. Coordinate with army elements on your flanks. Stick to your training, and we will come out of this unscathed.\n\nAnd now, brothers! To arms! For a better tomorrow! For the glory of our Dąbrowian homeland!"

 dgr_district.1.desc: "Can a so-called government that controls only one district have any legitimacy to govern the entire city? Dąbrowa Górnicza is a highly conflicted place, if not one outright in a state of anarchy. Gangs constantly terrorize people, holding them in an iron grip while fighting among themselves, for control of one or two more already devastated buildings. Huta Katowice has become the last bastion of municipal administration, and it has been taken over by the Communist Party of Poland. How desperate must a person be to decide to hand over power to a group of geriatric dinosaurs from a bygone era? Marcin Bazylak had no choice. Well, he had a choice, but he probably would have ended up hanging from a lamppost in Haller’s Park. So, he decided to make a pact with the devil and establish a government of municipal unity in the most powerful steel combine in all of Poland - Katowice Steelworks.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone agrees with this decision, and in the industrial heart of Dąbrowa Górnicza, the government managed to gather fewer than a thousand supporters. Can such a small number of soldiers subdue a city of over a hundred thousand? They will definitely need help and skillful maneuvering between the gangs. It's time to divide and conquer."

 unification.14.desc: "In an unexpected turn of events, a little dictatorship from Dąbrowa Górnicza managed to conquer their surrounding territories. Surrounded by more powerful enemies, it held on, and thanks to the Katowice Steelworks and the power of industry it prevailed against the early onslaught, conquering Jura.\nThe strange combination of communism and nationalism has proved to be stable and effective so far. It is not entirely clear what the relations between individual factions are, but taking into account their morale - we cannot count on an imminent end to this pact of two devils.\nThe People's Front of Zagłębie (as was their official name) now has at its disposal the untamed industrial power of the Dąbrowa Basin. It would seem that they will hit Silesia next, but unofficial sources seem to report that their eyes are focused on Lesser Poland."

 unificationreg.14.t: "[GetNewspaper]National People's Army unifies Lesser Poland"
 unificationreg.14.desc: "Lesser Poland has chosen socialism over death, though the decision wasn’t exactly free and unanimous, as shots can still be heard around Wawel Castle and in the wilderness of the Tatra Mountains. Still, it has become clear that with their resolute determination to liberate every workplace (especially heavy industry such as steelworks), National Bolshevik troops have triumphed everywhere from Przemsza to Dunajec. Fire blazes from the furnaces once more, along with the spirit of communism aided by nationalist rhetoric.\n\nHowever, reports emerge of a spike in internal disputes, as not all communists wish to adhere to the bloody ideological legacy of Mieczysław Moczar, and even fewer nationalists want to continue to cooperate with those advocating for the same communist ideology that enslaved the country for nearly 50 years. Despite this, heavily funded propaganda aims to temporarily reassure the citizens, but the first cracks are beginning to appear on this grand hybrid project."

 unificationsupreg.14.desc: "During times of crisis, makeshift states often end up collapsing, and yet the unusual ideological mix comprising the National People’s Army managed to overcome all internal divisions. The solution, proclaimed by the party as a “vast refreshment of inner quality”, was, in fact, a massive political purge of all political opponents and factions that formed in opposition to the burgeoning project. For quite some time now, the NPA ceased to function only as a paramilitary organization, with the growing party apparatus taking over many civilian governmental functions. For this reason, after a grand military parade in Lublin, Krzysztof Szwej announced the creation of the National People’s Republic of Poland, together with the releasing of a manifesto addressed to all of the country’s citizens - “The victory of the Polish working class is approaching, and just like a hundred years ago, the only legitimate government exists here, in Lublin.”"

Poland emerges from the ashes as a militaristic country, built upon the pillars of fanatical nationalism and hardline communism, causing widespread panic among neighboring states. Even separately, the two ideologies are enemies of the free world. Together, they form an axis of evil in the eyes of Western powers. \nInside the country, the truth can hardly be distinguished from propaganda, as following a bloody civil war, it is impossible to tell who died as a result of the fighting, and who was forcefully “redistributed”. In the areas where no shot has been fired for years, internment camps remain, and all political organizations except for the supreme party have been disbanded, with all opposition activity subsequently banned. \nThe National People’s Republic of Poland is moving towards another permanent revolution, and with Europe divided and at its weakest, the second half of the 21st century might just belong to National Bolshevism."
