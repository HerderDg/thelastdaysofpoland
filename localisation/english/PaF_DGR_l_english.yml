 DGR_faction_desc: "Securing power in the city wasn't as easy as it was in General Secretary's mind. Dozens of minor factions were squabbling between themselves after the Fall, fighting for scraps of once prosperous city in the region. Most of them were simply gangs and raiders, but there are also some ideological groups of fanatics. Remnants of Dąbrowa Górnicza local parliament were disbanded and forced to flee before some bandits could hang them up on the nearest lantern. They've found a shelter in Katowice Steelworks, biggest complex of this kind in the whole Poland. But factory was already controlled by Communist Party of Poland, and so they unexpectedly have gained a leadership over Dąbrowa's legitimate government, and it was up to them to bring order in the city."

 DGR_OL_convoy_to_cargo: "Send armored convoy to PKP Cargo"
 DGR_OL_convoy_to_cargo_desc: "PKP Cargo in Strzemieszyce is a very important freight hub for supplies; we can't just leave it in the hands of the rebels. Fortunately, the railway from Huta Katowice leads straight to the station. All we need to do is send them a Trojan train."
 DGR_OL_cutoff_s1: "Cut off the S1 Expressway"
 DGR_OL_cutoff_s1_desc: "The S1 Expressway cuts through our city in half, with us effectively separated from the main urban area. Moreover, by controlling the interchange at Sulno, we will be able to follow National Road 94 through all of Strzemieszyce. And if we happen to gain control of the micro-steel mill and fuel tanks in the process? All the better."
 DGR_OL_march_on_basilica: "March on Strzemieszyce Basilica"
 DGR_OL_march_on_basilica_desc: "It's time to settle the score with the rebels from the Strzemieszyce People's Republic. Let our popular action be the final act in the history of Strzemieszyce separatism and put an end, once and for all, to their dreams of seceding from Dąbrowa Górnicza!"
 DGR_OL_disband_organisations: "Disband social and political organizations"
 DGR_OL_disband_organisations_desc: "Each of the rebels will be brought before a people's court and will not escape punishment. All non-communist organizations will be immediately dissolved by decree, and their members sent for compulsory reeducation. Such is the will of the people."

 DGR_OW_cutoff_euroterminal_desc: "Following the railway tracks from Strzemieszyce, we can effectively split the rebellious Sławków Republic in half, allowing us to divert their attention and undoubtedly create chaos among their ranks. What will they defend more vigorously: the city or the Euroterminal?"
 DGR_OW_send_armored_convoys: "Send armored convoys to the city"
 DGR_OW_send_armored_convoys_desc: "National Road 94 leads us straight through the heart of Sławków. Convenient, isn't it? All we need to do is send a few armored vehicles down this road to take control of the entire city. There will be no resistance"
 DGR_OW_arrest_separatists: "Arrest separatist leaders"
 DGR_OW_arrest_separatists_desc: "Sławków reactionary bandits, only mistakenly referred to as an army, fled to the Euroterminal, leaving the city to its fate.

 DGR_OW_teach_them_lesson: "Teach them a lesson"
 DGR_OW_teach_them_lesson_desc: "The assault on the Euroterminal may prove to be a bloody undertaking. But this blood is necessary for the rebuilding of our city; the wealth amassed there will allow us to rise from our knees, and unlocking the freight route will finally enable our development.

 ## Ministers ##
 ## First Tree ##
 DGR_forgotten_city: "Forgotten City"
 DGR_forgotten_city_desc: "You could ask a random person about Dąbrowa Górnicza, and they won't point out its location. At most, they might mention something about an orgy at the parish house. We are forgotten by God, and he's what's most missing in the Red Basin. Instead we have him. President Marcin Bazylak. In the face of a crumbling state, he crumbles the most. He didn't even try to save the situation as it completely overwhelmed him. The formal alliance with Sosnowiec and the other cities in the region was forced upon him, and he had no say in it. Not that it would help him. He sits locked in his city hall like King Popiel in his tower.\n\nAnd the mice and rats are coming. Dąbrowa will be taken over by the law of the jungle, and the strongest tribe will take it all."
 DGR_last_man_standing: "Last Man Standing" 
 DGR_last_man_standing_desc: "Fantastic. Everything went according to plan. Control over the city hall doesn't mean control over the city, but it's just the first piece of the puzzle. The Palace of Culture, Katowice Steelworks, PKP Cargo. Strategic infrastructural, administrative, and cultural nodes. This is the key to complete control over the city. Even one as unruly as Dąbrowa. The only problem might be clearing huge swaths of land that we simply don't have enough people to control.\n\nSend tanks to the Steelworks! Just like in the good old days."
 DGR_sztygarka_robbery: "Robbery at the Sztygarka Museum"
 DGR_sztygarka_robbery_desc: "In the very center of the city sits a perfect Trojan horse, ready to be used by those daring enough to aim high. And that's exactly what we will do. Tanks. Transporters. Museum weapons, old but still functional. And since there's a gas station on the way with some fuel left... I'll only need a few good men.\n\nAnd we'll go on a trip. We'll visit Mr. President. And he will agree to everything we put in front of him. Why? Let's say we'll have very strong arguments."
 DGR_weeds_to_eradicate: "Weeds to Eradicate"
 DGR_weeds_to_eradicate_desc: "KURWA. It should have turned out differently. I underestimated the deadly spirit of this city, which is constantly ready to self-destruct rather than cooperate. So, we lost everything. Well, almost. We managed to escape with a handful of our people to Łęknice, where our last major base is located. Our fortune will change soon. How could it not, since power in the city has been given to Joseph Stalin's Supreme Geriatric Council? Bazylak really hit his head when he fell out of that tram. Handing over power to the communists is a brilliant shot in the foot. Moreover, they are surrounded on all sides by hostile gangs and partisans. And we are one of them.\n\nOnce we rebuild our strength and destroy them, we'll still have to deal with the separatists from Strzemieszyce and Sławków. They hate our city so much they are ready to see it burn. Not on our watch. Even if we have to team up with the red devil against the traitors of Dąbrowa unity!"
 DGR_uneasy_peace: "Uneasy Peace"
 DGR_uneasy_peace_desc: "Big fucking surprise you're all hanging out together, you're all fucked in the head. A rastafarian, a PiS deputy, a leftist, a retired doctor, and a communist. Lumpenproletariat to the fullest. This so-called \"People's Front\" will fall apart from within sooner than it will be able to defeat anyone outside. Better for us. In that case, returning to power and full strength is a matter of weeks, not months. We need to be ready when the reds start tearing each other apart for the last scraps of the city. Of course, as long as grandpa Szwej doesn't forget where he is and why he's there."
 DGR_wrong_neighborhood: "Wrong Neighbourhood"
 DGR_wrong_neighborhood_desc: "Fucking ghetto. No wonder Bazylak didn't want to do anything. It was harmful, but definitely smarter than stirring up the hornet's nest. Sztygars, Pharaohs, Feta Kings, gangs from Gołonóg. They are all a degenerate bunch with a negative IQ and an overgrown cult of violence! Only the ŁI has the moral high ground here. And thanks to our faith in our values, soon at the steelworks it will be better to be dead than red..."
 DGR_troublesome_alliance: "Troublesome Alliance"
 DGR_troublesome_alliance_desc: "Bazylak is going to Sosnowiec. I don't know why? To pay feudal homage to the great strategist and 'uncle' of the Polish leftists? After all, Czarzasty is the greatest right-wing patriot of the entire Republic, no one has destroyed left-wing movements and party structures on the left side of the barricade as well as he has. I say let him go. Even Czarzasty, despite his ineptitude in recognizing that it's already the 21st century, won't be stupid enough to get involved in any help for the lost cause that Bazylak presents. Especially since he is now working for Szwej, and he has similar grudges against Czarzasty as every straight thinking person on the left side. I won't even mention Jaworzno, giving any attention to those bandits is a crime against common sense."
 DGR_supress_dissent: "Supress Dissent"
 DGR_supress_dissent_desc: "Something festers in the middle of the Katowice Steelworks. Something that we have failed to see. Intelligence reports that our beloved People's Front is gathering strength and is on the brink of launching a special military operation. We must prepare for the eventual repulsion of their invasion into our controlled districts. The problem is, they could go in any direction, and we don't know what's happening in that communist hole.\n\nThe closed gates of the Steelworks will open once again. The red flood that will pour over the entire city must be stopped. But their numbers make it likely that it will only be a small rain rather than a flood."
 DGR_central_planning_commision: "Central Planning Commision"
 DGR_central_planning_commision_desc: "Our industry has died and now it stinks. Oh, wait. It's just the standard smells coming from the steelworks. The industrial plants in the city have shut down along with the rest of the country. The decaying carcass of the Dąbrowa economy is a testament of this city itself. At least the sky has become somewhat bluer. If only people weren't dying of hunger, this might be a plus. Apparently, a Central Planning Commission has been established to revive the economic power of the heart of the Zagłębie\n\nBrick by brick, machine by machine, the spirit of people's thrift will be used to produce 200% of the norm, in exchange for hunger rations just to fuel the communists' war efforts. But soon we will be back at the top of the rankings. Of cities with the highest air pollution..."
 DGR_restore_palace_of_culture: "Restore Palace of Culture"
 DGR_restore_palace_of_culture_desc: "Zagłębie's Palace of Culture. The impaired younger brother of Warsaw's Palace of Culture, a mediocre caricature of what was supposed to be a powerful cultural symbol of the region but became just a black hole absorbing millions for renovations. Another great renovation is ahead. The communists, taking over the center, will want to complete the vision of our graciously reigning ex-president Bazylak and make the Palace of Culture a true government center.\n\nIn fact, it's not such a stupid idea. If it were transformed into a likeness of the Presidential Palace, it could serve as a strong symbol of the city's power and its reborn glory. Except that Szwej couldn't sit there... Even Jimmy Hendrix sitting next to the palace in Freedom Square can see that he's not leader material deserving of such a grand palace."
 DGR_undermine_drug_dealers: "Destroy Drug Dealing Operations"
 DGR_undermine_drug_dealers_desc: "When your family home is snatched from your hands and taken over by a gang of criminal degenerates, certain principles cease to matter. In this case, maybe the enemy of my enemy is not entirely my friend, but I can only tell them one thing - BURN THIS PLAGUE TO THE GROUND.\n\nReden is one of the districts most infected with the virus of deviant crime. Only the northern areas of Gołonóg with Spisak and Łączna streets together with Mydlice can directly compete with Reden in the category of \"districts where you don't want to live.\" I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm glad the People's Front \"liberated\" Reden, even if only temporarily. There's a fraction of hope that these areas will experience the long-awaited and deserved peace without major battles in Haller's Park or dealers from Orzeszkowa street lurking on every corner."
 DGR_raise_popular_militias: "Raise Popular Militias"
 DGR_raise_popular_militias_desc: "No one wants to die for the red dream. Volunteers here are as rare as hen's teeth, as we have learned ourselves. And what can the communists say? Like it or not, they have to start recruiting. But how? Encouraging people to flee to the Steelworks. But with what? Fruit Thursdays? A solid paycheck? Tons of crude steel from the steelworks? The communist revolution? They might try to call up the steelworkers, but there aren't many left. Their only way out will be forcibly enlisting ordinary citizens. Good luck bringing them from areas controlled by gangs. We must be doubly vigilant so that agents of the revolution don't roam our lands, stealing our people. Once upon a time, black Volgas were real boogeymen... the world has moved forward but not the communist parties. Only the car models have changed."
 DGR_przyjazn_coking_plant: "Restore 'Przyjaźń' Coking Plant"
 DGR_przyjazn_coking_plant_desc: "Once the most modern coking plant in the country. Then taken over by the bean counters of Jastrzębie Coal Company. The country has fallen, but the corporate rats still operate in the plant. Whoever takes over this area will have quite a hard nut to crack, mostly because the coking plant is in a state of decay. But if it could be restored to full functionality - it would fuel our economy immensely. Among the smoke and pyrolysis, the main foundation of the city's economy will arise. Once again. The name of it still bothers me, though."
 DGR_tucznawa_zone: "Tucznawa Investition Zone"
 DGR_tucznawa_zone_desc: "Dąbrowa is very spacious. After all, it was once the 9th largest city in Poland for a reason. But of course, Gdynia and Świnoujście claimed the sea as a city land, and we fell to 11th place. Nothing lost, this will change soon. Shipyard workers cannot compete with steelworkers. But back to the point - we have a lot of land to manage. That is why, for several years, a huge investment zone has been designated in Tucznawa to be filled with various industrial plants. These areas will be the perfect complement to the iron core of the city's economy."
 DGR_dzierzynski_steelworks: "Renovate Dzierżyński Steelworks"
 DGR_dzierzynski_steelworks_desc: "Bank Steelworks. Now it is a shithole, but under communism, it was a magnificent factory. No wonder they decided to return to its former name - Feliks Dzierżyński Steelworks. It is not as large and efficient as Katowice Steelworks, but its history dates back to the times when cannons for the January insurgents were forged there. Cieszkowski was on point with those guns. He knew how to make good use of the potential of this plant. Even the Nazis, who during the war assembled their tanks like Panthers, Tigers, and even parts for V1 and V2 rockets there, appreciated it. Interesting... maybe some archival technical documents could be found there..."
 DGR_monuments_of_old_times: "Desert Trip"
 DGR_monuments_of_old_times_desc: "Everyone really thinks that Błędów and the Błędów Desert are one and the same. The truth is, the name comes from this place, but only a small, heavily forested piece is within the city's borders. The rest is already in Lesser Poland. Fortunately, the Ziobrists don't go to the desert, so the gang called the Pharaohs operates in areas larger than any other. But it would be more than enough to drive into Błędów with an old tank for them to capitulate. I don't think they would even resist. They're just there for show, nothing more."
 DGR_rastafarian_question: "Rastafarian Question"
 DGR_rastafarian_question_desc: "Eating, drinking, smoking joints. Dancing, revelry, and frolic. And this is not a scene from Adam Mickiewicz but the situation in Zielona Park, where a real Rastafarian commune has emerged. It's hard to even call them a gang... because they just sit there and basically don't compete with anyone. Probably because they are constantly high. Plus, the blessing of People's Front Minister Damian Krępa means they enjoy government protection. They are harmless in their activities. If we leave them there, they won't even know what's going on around them. Only God knows if they are even aware that Poland no longer exists. Well, we could also just scatter them and none would be the wiser..."
 DGR_undermine_opposition: "Root Out Separatist Movements"
 DGR_undermine_opposition_desc: "Traitors, traitors, all of them traitors! Not only was Sławków once part of Dąbrowa Górnicza, but they apparently didn't like it so much that they decided to secede and join Będzin County, which they don't even border! Their impudence knows no bounds. Now, when they have once again become part of our great city - they have again caused a rift in unity and rebelled. Additionally, they have infected the residents of Strzemieszyce with their separatist virus. Every independence activist must pay for their crimes. Every whisper of freedom should be drowned in blood. Enough of the dreamers' fantasies. We are all Dąbrowians."
 DGR_every_worker_a_soldier: "Every Worker a Soldier"
 DGR_every_worker_a_soldier_desc: "Young Steelworkers. Another stain on the city map that is only suitable for disposal in the blast furnace no. 2 at the Steelworks. But apparently, according to the communists, everyone is a potential carrier of the revolution. Sounds contagious indeed. Ząbkowice has always been a hotel for workers who worked in nearby plants, and not much has changed. Only I wonder - if you call up workers as soldiers... who will work in these plants to produce equipment for the soldiers? Something doesn't add up, Comrade Szwej."
 DGR_negotiate_with_li: "Negotiate with ŁI"
 DGR_negotiate_with_li_desc: "When in fear, God is dear. The People's Front officially wants to negotiate with us. Mainly because the young squatters from Ząbkowice do not share their outdated point of view. Hell has truly frozen over. Someone trusted the horseshoe theory as the ideal way out of their problems too much. I won't say nationalism in both cases is not similar...and...no, it's a betrayal. But... maybe? Maybe this is the chance? To participate in forming a new Dąbrowian government, transforming the city in our image and likeness. We would have the opportunity to achieve the influence we originally lacked. And when the right moment comes - blow up the system from within and reign unchallenged. It is a tough nut to crack because with each passing moment, I see more and more sense in this madness. Only how to convince my people that this is the way?"
 DGR_heavy_machinery_production: "Gangers into Militias"
 DGR_heavy_machinery_production_desc: "What is the difference between a gangster and a soldier? Mainly the equipment. Well, in the case of communist militias, the only difference is that they are led by ideological officers, not the biggest thug in the neighborhood who dares to call himself the big boss. But even the best officer is useless when he has idiots from the ghetto under his command, whose only skill is to assault an old lady in a group of five. Because if someone shows up who can stand up to them, then the boys will run for the hills!\n\nThey need firm officers with an iron hand and iron will who can make men out of these gangsters. Otherwise, I don't see any grand victories for this army for quite some time."
 DGR_katowice_steelworks: "Complete Restoration of Katowice Steelworks"
 DGR_katowice_steelworks_desc: "Katowice Steelworks has transformed from a collapsing post-fall industrial plant into the center of armed revolution. Now that the whole city is relatively peaceful, this giant must be restored to its nominal processing power. The communists can leave, and the workers return to work. Furnaces and chimneys must be renovated. Rolling mills repaired. The power plant integrated into the municipal network. Conveyor belts restarted. There is much to be done to make Dąbrowa's pride the most powerful industrial plant in the country again. Exactly. Dąbrowa's. Katowice should disappear from the name. We shouldn't give the Silesians any reasons to be proud.\n\nEvery builder of the renewed Huta Katowice will be a pioneer of success. But to achieve this... SHUT UP AND WORK OVERTIME!"
 DGR_our_position: "Our Position in Dąbrowa Basin"
 DGR_our_position_desc: "Bazylak got us into this sick alliance. Come on, Marcin - it's going to fucking explode. If leftists hate anything more than rightists, it's other leftists whose ideology differs even a little. Antifa, socialists, communists, anarchists. Only one of these ideas will ultimately triumph, and the rest will have to be turned to dust. Not to mention that there are other nationalists in the north. And Ziobro, even though he got hit in his balls once and has his own problems now, he still remains an unpredictable entity. We can only rely on ourselves. Which is ironic because I can't even trust other members of the government. But we play with the cards we've been dealt."
 DGR_nationalist_communist_paramilitary: "Natonalist-Communist Paramilitary"
 DGR_nationalist_communist_paramilitary_desc: "It happened. The official signing of the nationalist-communist alliance. Our units will maintain complete autonomy within the newly created National People's Army. Szwej turned out to be weak, agreeing to most of our demands. Normally I would see this as a trick or a stratagem, but I can recognize when someone has insincere intentions. Here, all I saw was desperation. Democrats will not follow the old order. The modern left won't either. This city is thoroughly sick. And we are the only cure.\n\nNow everyone will know the price of messing with us. Our stark resolve will revive the spirit of Dąbrowian people thanks to our methods. Soon enough we shall be in charge of the whole National People's Army. Oh, how they will all weep then. Political ideology won't matter when you have the strength of a grand army to back you up."
 DGR_congress_of_bedzin: "Congress of Będzin"
 DGR_congress_of_bedzin_desc: "What I feared may come to pass sooner than I expected. The second Congress of Intercounty will take place in Będzin. Everyone will be there with their most important dignitaries. I will not be sidelined, I must have a place in the Dąbrowian delegation. Not that I plan something very funny. But I would very much like to see the faces of Czarzasty, Żukowska, and Konieczny when they realize who is sitting on the other side of the table. Although on the other hand, 50 hours of boring bullshit containing the imperative of equality and the socialist idea makes me nauseous already. If the Intercounty somehow survives, we must take as much as possible for ourselves. \n\nIf not... good riddance."
 DGR_industrial_heart: "Industrial Heart of Zagłębie"
 DGR_industrial_heart_desc: "Finally, all elements of the industrial puzzle have been united into one steel fist. The reborn heart of Zagłębie beats to the rhythm of progress. Among machines, smoke, and steel, the entire economic power of Dąbrowa Górnicza works for the benefit of the nation. The Dąbrowian nation. We are the custodians of industrialization and pioneers of the revolution. This force cannot be stopped anymore. With each successive completed workers' plan, the army and society grow in wealth.\n\nNow we must focus all our productive power on one goal. War is coming. The lightning is red, the hammer will forge an iron sword. The National People's Army is the child of the power of Dąbrowa's heavy industry. And thanks to these plants, the rest of Poland will feel what Zagłębie Dąbrowskie is capable of."
 DGR_aftermath: "Aftermath"
 DGR_aftermath_desc: "I can't say that I did not expect this. However, the intensity of the socialist outcry that took place in the final hours of the congress in Będzin exceeded my wildest expectations. Traitors of the revolution, Nazis in red robes, sellouts, brown fascists, useful PiS idiots, volksdeutsche, smiling clowns. The list of invectives that all sides threw at each other was enormous. And all this in a few minutes during the last meeting. We were on the verge of an agreement. We were this close. But the masks finally fell off, and no one hid the fact that we despise each other.\n\nIntercounty is a dead corpse on which crows and ravens will feed. The time of war conflagration has come. There is no turning back from this path. Time for action."
 DGR_glory_parade: "Rose Alley Parade"
 DGR_glory_parade_desc: "Our combat value may be negligible, but at least we can march proudly. This is also a symbol of hope for the city's population. Hope that there finally exists a formation that will defend their lives. Even if in its ranks are those who not long ago would gladly take that life from them. Never mind. Guarded by disciplined officers, the soldiers will be obedient because that is the only thing they are morally capable of. You only need to be more menacing than their previous gang leaders; the mere power of authority will do the rest. Such a mixture, seasoned with the latest military vehicles freshly released by the Dąbrowa steel mills, will march today along Rose Alley towards the city center to pledge loyalty to the People's Front in front of the Palace of Culture. If only these idiots do not trip over their own feet."
 DGR_working_people: "For the Working People!"
 DGR_working_people_desc: "I never thought I would ever be an advocate of working-class pride. But at a time when it is so closely intertwined with the military and nationalist spirit, I am able to undertake a few rhetorical liberties. Whatever one might say about the communists – the working class must be properly nurtured because it constitutes the core of every well-functioning state. And we fight for a better tomorrow especially for them. Because if the working class is taken care of, so will the families they work to provide. And from there, it's just a short step to a happy society."
 DGR_emergency_mobilization: "Emergency Mobilization"
 DGR_emergency_mobilization_desc: "War in the metropolis will be quite specific. Already at this moment, we can see the troops of our new opponents on the other side of some streets. Mydlice will be a very critical point; we must conduct a very strong mobilization there. After all, people do not have to fight for the idea of communism if they can fight for their home and the safety of their families. This will certainly work. In other areas, we are separated by large forested terrains like Zielona Park or Zagórze Forest. This will allow for some tactical freedom...but we still need to recruit everyone capable of defending our reborn home."
 DGR_war_communism: "War Communism"
 DGR_war_communism_desc: "Solving our problems will not be easy, so temporarily we must undertake certain measures. Of course only for the duration of the war. No one expects it to last long, so they will grit their teeth and meekly comply. Oh...if only they knew they were going into a total war. All plants work at 200% capacity to fulfill all orders for the army. We will need 300% if we are to fight multiple opponents simultaneously. We must squeeze the last drop of sweat from every small workshop. Only overwhelming force and a crushing blow will allow us to emerge from this chaos unscathed. And since the army will now be the main decider of the state's fate, comrade Szwej doesn't need to be so aware of many things.\n\nAll power to the army. This is where the fun begins..."
 DGR_popular_army: "For the Popular Army!"
 DGR_popular_army_desc: "With the constant influx of fresh recruits, we can slowly phase out the criminal elements in favor of the youth, who are perfectly suited to building an army that believes in its ideals. National ideals. And we will be the sculptors who will shape them into perfect soldiers fulfilling the moral imperative of the revolution. But not necessarily a socialist revolution. Not in its strict sense. The political brass may be socialist, but we are the element that will bring victory for our homeland. And they will all depend on us for securing the future. And that future will not be populist. It will be national-populist!"
 DGR_to_arms_comrades: "To Arms Comrades!"
 DGR_to_arms_comrades_desc: "One might want to hum \"Arise, you wretched of the earth,\" but it seems they sing that in Sosnowiec. At least, sometimes you can hear it from their soldiers stationed in Zagórze. The pawns are positioned on the board, and each of us waits to see who will make the first move. In this duel of gunslingers, however, we must be wise. If we strike first, it may turn out that a third party will strike us at the worst possible moment. Dear officers, you must be clever and cunning. We have the most territory to cover, but we must turn this into our advantage, as maneuverability will be the key. Striking strategic points and cutting crucial communication nodes. Coordinate with army elements on your flanks. Stick to your training, and we will come out of this unscathed.\n\nAnd now, brothers! To arms! For a better tomorrow! For the glory of our Dąbrowian homeland!"

DGR_national_security_comission_desc: "It's war then. For a moment, I hoped that the esteemed political council would kindly back off from their ideas about military strategy. But of course, they have to add their two cents to topics they have no clue about. National Security Commission. More like the National Commission for Ensuring that Nationalists Don't Win the War Themselves. Fighting the enemy is easy. Fighting political old fogies however...it would be better to let me charge tanks on a bicycle. Comrade Szwej comes from times when the only preferred tactic was a mass charge into the unknown\n\nThe worst part is that the commission will decide on the allocation of the military budget for specific projects. I have a lot of convincing and political maneuvering ahead of me to ensure these are sensible investments."
DGR_nationalise_brembo_desc: "I hoped that we would transform the Brembo plant into a factory for military vehicle parts. So far, all I've gotten is the nationalization of the plant and very long internal fights over who will be on the new management board. There's no talk of transforming the production line until the old-timers divide the positions among themselves. This factory produced braking systems before the war, and all I can get are tons of brake discs and pads. I don't know if this is ironic, as no one slows down investments as much as party members. In the long run, at least the plant will be useful, once it starts operating."
DGR_connect_unused_railways_desc: "Many railway lines, both passenger and freight, in the city have fallen into disrepair. Yet, we have one of the most extensive freight rail networks in the country. The trains were crucial during the city's cleansing operations. We need to rebuild the damaged tracks and create a network of railway connections around the city. This will allow us to move equipment quickly to any front line. Perhaps we could also build a few armored trains?"
DGR_logistical_behemoth_desc: "The Sławków Euroterminal is one of the most important transshipment points in this part of Europe. It is located near the intersection of two Pan-European Transport Corridors and is connected to the major industrial plants in our city. Logistics will be crucial in the current wars. Warlords send their soldiers on deadly marches without support, proper supplies, or transportation. They might afford such idiotic tactics of wasting their people, but we cannot. Trucks, trains, cargo terminals, supply hubs—these are the foundations of a healthy army. One that every soldier will want to serve in."
DGR_commandeer_museum_vehicles_desc: "Lord giveth, and Lord taketh away. Yes, it's true. We stole vehicles from the museum to stage a coup against Bazylak. But they should have been guarded! The vehicles were returned to their original place after we abandoned them. Fortunately, no one else knew how to operate them, so they sat in front of the city hall for several months. But why shouldn't we use them? They are still operational machines, rearming them won't take long, and they are more useful now than ever. Besides, I got used to these steel beasts in those few hours. We're taking everything we can from Sztygarka."
DGR_secret_files_of_bankhutte_desc: "I can't believe my eyes. What started as a wild idea in my head has come true! My people combed through every archival document from the Bank Steelworks... sorry, Dzierżyński Steelworks. What they found there... wow. I don't know how it survived the years of communization, decommunization, and recommunization, but we found technical documents on tanks built here during World War II. Germans assembled Panthers and Tigers here! Unfortunately, there are no documents for V1 and V2 rockets. A pity. But still, if everything goes according to plan, we will be able to produce our own Panzerkampfwagen. Of course, rechristened in a communist style, with improved mechanisms and more modern weaponry. Just imagine the looks on our enemies' faces!"
DGR_first_mixed_brigade_desc: "An army doesn't live by infantry alone. To break through to the northern borders of Jura and Dąbrowian Basin, we will need maneuverability and vehicles capable of traversing difficult terrain. Yes, I am thinking ahead, but only this way will we be prepared for anything. We need a proper armored brigade. Okay, maybe we can't field a true one. But if we gather all our junk vehicles, detach them from infantry support, add newly produced vehicles, and combine them into a single armored fist, then we'll have at least some element of strength. It's more than what others have. And it will be a significant advantage."
DGR_restore_jw_sulno_desc: "During the communist era, there was a military unit in Sulno. Initially, it served as housing for workers involved in building the nearby micro-steelworks. Now, it's the perfect place to re-establish a military unit, given its proximity to Sosnowiec. Besides, we need to accommodate our growing number of soldiers somewhere. They can't keep sleeping in a hotel; it's absurd from a security standpoint. And they shouldn't have it too easy—after all, this is the army, not an all-inclusive vacation."
DGR_fortify_slawkow_desc: "Sławków is highly exposed to attacks from both Sosnowiec and Jaworzno. Since it's our key logistical hub, we can't leave it vulnerable. Therefore, it's essential to fortify the Euroterminal and all exposed railway lines. The damn forest doesn't make our job any easier, and enemy bands are just waiting for a moment of weakness to strike our critical points. We'll have to assign people to guard posts, as if I didn't already have enough problems with manpower."
DGR_turn_mydlice_into_fortress_desc: "Since the Battle of Stalingrad, the world has witnessed the horrors of urban warfare. Today, each of the massive communist apartment blocks stands as a fortress, perfectly suited for defense. Why bother with bunkers when a concrete jungle serves the same purpose at a lower cost? A bit of reinforced concrete makes the enemy think twice before entering a trap where every window could be a hail of bullets and projectiles. The sheer size of these skyscrapers also means nothing escapes our notice. And even if they manage to reach one building, they'll have to clear it floor by floor, apartment by apartment, room by room. The cost of capturing such a stronghold is simply prohibitive."
DGR_officers_in_gangs_desc: "We may have rushed too much in parting ways with the cannon fodder that the gangs represented. We'll need to make amends with them now that the time of trial has come, and wartime effort is required from everyone. However, there's no way we're just going to hand them weapons and let them run wild. Each gang unit will be assigned one of our officers. This way, we'll ensure control at every level and reduce the chances of rebellion or insubordination."
DGR_political_commissars_desc: "Swish, swoosh and bang - my dreams have gone up in smoke. I was hoping for officers who would answer to my authority, not ideological commissars who will dutifully report every minor infraction to the party leadership. I suppose I'd probably do the same in their position. But that's fine. Indoctrination and complete brainwashing take a long time, which makes such commissars quite valuable. Besides, our gang members aren't exactly skilled with grenades... accidents are bound to happen."
DGR_partisan_blitzkrieg_desc: "The vast expanse of our city allows for wide-front maneuver warfare to unfold here. However, the abundance of forests, lakes, apartment blocks, and overall biome diversity means we can primarily engage in guerilla warfare. Defending our territory isn't as daunting when every nook and cranny can serve as a hideout for partisans. Local knowledge will definitely tip the scales in our favor; even the smallest park will become a Vietnam or Afghanistan for any invaders."
DGR_revenge_at_czarzasty_desc: "Włodzimierz Czarzasty. The most reviled figure by anyone under 60. Unless, of course, you're 140 years old and a communist like Comrade Szwej. Czarzasty has always seen Zagłębie as his stronghold of support. But for what he's done to the left... the right will congratulate him, while leftists will want his blood. His traditionalist views are unchangeable, and his contemptuous attitude towards everyone else in the now thankfully defunct Intercounty has become legendary. Now we'll repay him in kind. As another leftist leader once said, a man is judged by how he finishes. And Czarzasty will end badly."
DGR_strike_back_at_antifa_desc: "Even more than the contemptible duo from Sosnowiec, I detest the rabble from Jaworzno. The anarcho-communists from Antifa have no respect for anyone. Whether it's Ziobro's puppets, us, or the Silesians, they'll rob, attack, and call everyone fascists. I've had enough of these 'border incidents' where gangs turn our border into their personal squat. We need to strike back, and we need to strike hard, so they won't even have a chance to lift their drug-fueled heads in response. The black terror of Antifa ends today!"
DGR_annexation_of_zagorze_desc: "Zagórze. Once a separate city, later annexed by Sosnowiec, and closely tied to Dąbrowa Górnicza. Let's be honest - most of the population lived there just to commute to work in the Dąbrowa steel mills. So why create unnecessary problems by maintaining a boundary between these two urban centers? We should simply annex Zagórze as a rightful district of Dąbrowa Górnicza. It always should have been that way. At least the boundaries will be neater and more logical."
DGR_railway_siewierz_zabkowice_desc: "We urgently need a railway connection running from our industrial centers to Pyrzowice Airport. Currently, the route goes through Zawiercie, but there's no need to detour there when we can run the railway straight through Siewierz and Mierzęcice. The airport will serve as our gateway to the world, and we plan to start moving a significant amount of goods through it—both for export and import. Until we can repair the roads, investing in trains will be more practical and cost-effective."
DGR_connect_lagisza_desc: "Będzin industry is going through very difficult times. The cement plant in Grodziec, the Będzin steelworks, the Grodziec coal mine, the shoe factory - none of these establishments exist anymore. The power plant in Łagisza itself operates at only about 20% of its nominal capacity. This is what capitalist rule has led to. A key branch of the economy has become a mere shadow of its former self - from the power plant, through the mines, and ending with the steelworks.\nWe must restore the proper strength of Będzin's industry by integrating it into our great industrial complex. By giving the first impulse ourselves, we will reactivate, step by step, all the closed plants, and it will be a fantastic investment in the future. And we will start with the steelworks."
DGR_question_of_leadership_desc: "The self-proclaimed capital of the Basin has fallen. How dared they call themselves the capital when the name itself is DĄBROWA BASIN, not SOSNOWIEC? But putting etymology aside, it must be acknowledged that Czarzasty built strong party structures here, something he failed to achieve across the country for so many years. Although everyone was ostensibly our opponent, and it's clear that many won't want to radicalize to fit our views, perhaps we can persuade some that our path is the right one. The question remains, though, whether we even want such people."
DGR_evict_squatters_desc: "Indeed, as much as one might criticize capitalist economies, the phenomenon of squatting is simply abhorrent. No matter who you are, how much you earn, or what you present, if bands of Antifa come knocking at your door, you can be sure that your property will turn into a haven for the worst kind of leftist degeneration. This has happened to a large number of apartments in Jaworzno - black squads had to find somewhere to settle, so they just kicked out random people - regardless of whether they were leftist or rightist, old or young, wealthy or poor. It was indiscriminate, treating everyone the same. But now, the time for justice has come. No squat will remain standing."
DGR_railway_around_myslowice_desc: "In Szczakowa, a northern district of Jaworzno, there is a large railway station connecting multiple lines. We need access to this station - a railway gateway that will open the way to the Silesian metropolis but won't lead to Katowice. It might also be wise to avoid Mysłowice, given the recent chaos with partisans and saboteurs. However, if we establish a new line from Euroterminal through Jaworzno and Imielin, we will create an easy route for encircling the metropolis and facilitating trade with Podbeskidzie and southern Małopolska."
DGR_connect_jaworzno_desc: "Fortunately for Jaworzno, true masters of industry have returned and are taking the helm. The Jaworzno Power Plant complex, combined with the rest of our energy network, will practically ensure independence from imports throughout the entire region. Meanwhile, Jaworzno's completely demolished industry will have to be thoroughly rebuilt. Recreational areas? Who needs them when people are starving!\nFirst, we will focus on rebuilding the glassworks in Szczakowa. After that, we will restore other elements of the city's industrial might that have been forgotten by previous governments."
DGR_question_of_councils_desc: "I wonder how anarchists ever achieved anything. Their communes are nothing more than another form of corrupt democracy. Adding to that, each operated for its own benefit, which makes it more accurate to call it not anarcho-communism but a rather strange form of anarcho-capitalism. Minister Gdula is the perfect example of this - he's a true hero of the real estate market! How can people like him even pretend to represent socialist ideals? At least I'm upfront about not having such ideals. Well, maybe sometimes I do."
DGR_reclaim_greater_zaglebie_desc: "Dąbrowa Basin isn't just Dąbrowa Górnicza, Sosnowiec, and Będzin. In fact, Jaworzno barely qualifies for that part. But the Basin also includes Olkusz, Zawiercie, and Myszków. At this rate, we might as well pull Częstochowa in too, so it doesn't feel left out in all of this. The situation is clear - we're now too far along to stop at just a few neighboring cities. I think I understand how Trotsky felt with his permanent revolution..."
DGR_red_star_over_jasna_gora_desc: "Jasna Góra. A symbol of Polish Catholicism. The Church has always had a somewhat ambivalent relationship with communism. Yes, it's known - Cardinal Wyszyński, Father Popiełuszko, and John Paul II destroyed little communists. But when we stand with the people, we cannot reject the Christian spirit in favor of some atheistic notions of young leftists. Belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster won't heal a divided nation. And please, let's keep the priests away from young boys. We don't want a repeat of our parish issues..."
DGR_adjust_jura_factories_desc: "Myszków and Zawiercie have long been tied to heavy industry in their regions. Additionally, the Światowit plant used to produce Frania washing machines! Who wouldn't want such a marvel now, especially when there will be a perfect demand for them? But beyond washing machines, the metallurgical plants in the Jura region will fit seamlessly into our economic framework. We need to strike while the iron is hot, so we should immediately start restructuring these plants and shifting production to meet our growing needs. Primarily, for the war effort..."
DGR_play_like_its_82_desc: "They want to play? Let them have it. They shouldn't forget under whose rule the Polish national team achieved its greatest successes. I know it's the twilight of their era, it's martial law times. But still, it says a lot about our sporting society. And since then? A quarter-final at Euro 2016 and defeats to powerhouses like Moldova, Kazakhstan, and the Faroe Islands. Coach Brzęczek might have the right ideas, but he lacks a solid state apparatus and a big, fucking army. And that's what we have. You can't build an army based on hooligans. Oh, wait. We kinda did."
DGR_death_forests_of_lubliniec_desc: "Lubliniec was supposed to be a walk in the park; the area isn't heavily urbanized or situated at particularly strategic points. Yet, fighting on these cursed fields is far from pleasant, and engaging with commandos is not easy, even, or perhaps especially, after their surrender. Especially considering they have access to fucking huge forests where they hide like cursed soldiers. How are we going to flush them out from there?"
DGR_imagine_shrooms_desc: "I sent my people to the slaughter. I don't even want to think about how many senseless deaths occurred in those cursed forests. Even setting them on fire didn't help. On the contrary, I'm sure that the fire has added dozens of soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorders to our losses. From Woźniki to Pawonki, the dead are piling up, and the devastation will remind us for weeks that we made a colossal mistake. And we still have to extinguish the fires and gather the bodies before they turn the soil into fertile ground for fungi."
DGR_offer_for_supreme_coach_desc: "Mr. Brzęczek, I respect you. You're an ideologically driven man - ambitious and with an extraordinary zeal for achieving your goals. Unfortunately, on the wrong side of the barricade. But don't worry, all Poles are one family, and the ideology of Marxism-Clubbism is so hysterically absurd that I can't help but respect the serious way you pursue such nonsense. Indeed, it's a better idea than most leftist movements. I'm not saying I'd be eager to implement it, but our cause needs people like you. Personally, I'd even be willing to persuade you to our side, offering amnesty for your closest collaborators and autonomy for the clubs. And if not, there's always room for a new coach at Tęcza Błędów..."
DGR_question_of_church_desc: "Częstochowa, as Poland's religious capital, has quite a socialist streak. After all, since 2010, it has been governed by a leftist president - one of the few who has managed to hold on in the country. Just like in Dąbrowa. Perhaps we could extract what's needed from this religious mix and create something interesting? For example, a nationalism rooted in Polish Catholic traditions combined with the socialist traits attributed to Jesus in the Bible. After all, he was considered one of the greatest socialists, as the classic saying goes. It seems to me that Comrade Konieczny (the one from the PPS, not the Antifa thug) was right in trying to create a popular religious organization here. We should seriously discuss this with him."
DGR_great_combine_desc: "What's better than one steel mill? Multiple steel mills working towards the same goal. Why waste time and money managing several separate plants when you can consolidate them into a massive central metallurgical complex that can handle any order in no time? Compatibility and interchangeability between specific units will be far more cost-effective than dividing them into separate entities. Or maybe I just know fuck all about economics and am spouting bullshit. Ah, but that would still make me more competent than our Minister of Economy."
DGR_avanti_popolo_desc: "The National People's Army has triumphed! From Częstochowa to Jaworzno, people can rejoice because we've reached the historic moment when, after many years, we are finally the masters of our own cities. The entire region deserves this tremendous revolutionary surge - we are the industrial heart of Poland, while Silesia is a shitty old pigsty. We carry the spark of pioneers who will renew this country! Each of us heralds greatness, justice, and equality. And rest assured - we will bring this torch of popular freedom to the rest of the country. Sooner or later."

DGR_we_forge_our_tomorrow_desc: "Sometimes I wonder if what I'm doing has any real significance. I'm just a tool of fate, one that can be discarded once the job is done. No matter what path I choose, in the end, it turns out that I'm not the one making the choices. The game was rigged from the start. Nationalism, communism, paganism - none of it matters. All that matters is playing your role well. Maybe then an opportunity will arise to change the status quo of reality. But for now, glory to the working people of cities and countryside, I guess... We're forging a new, national-popular future. How many more slogans will we churn out before they lose their meaning?"
DGR_unity_congress_desc: "The Party is calling. I'd pity myself if I had access to this Congress of the Working Class, but unfortunately, military personnel aren't welcome. I could argue that we work the hardest so that the apparatchiks can rot in their offices, enjoying freedom and life. But they can even have a damn UN summit if they want. The National People's Army now has enough influence in the country that it doesn't matter what decisions the comrades make."
DGR_civilian_rule_under_army_desc: "The party members deliberate, while the army decides. As Comrade Wiesław used to say, \"Power once seized will never be relinquished.\" And we certainly do not intend to give up our privileged position over the civilian authorities. We are the sole guarantors of our state's existence, and under the military banner, the national-popular future will flourish! It wasn't the bureaucrats who defended Sławków from the Antifa black gangs, nor did they defeat the enemies of communism in the Dąbrowa Basin, nor did they capture Jasna Góra. It was the army. And the army... is ours. Well, to be honest... it's MINE."
DGR_recommunization_desc: "There are, however, some things I have no control over, no matter how hard I try. But then again, it's not surprising. Nationalist rhetoric and symbolism are already well established in Poland. It's the communist one that needs to be revived and dug out of the infernal abyss. Only then will the idea of national communism be achieved when both elements mix and balance each other. As long as neither idea oversteps its bounds. Well, unless it's us. We can."
DGR_symbolism_act_desc: "In Poland, the hammer and sickle have always been regarded with the same revulsion as the swastika. Not much will change in that regard, so it's best to leave their use in the past. If we want to be taken seriously as a movement and not be lumped together with Stalin and Bierut, we need to promote our own symbols. The red lightning bolt and the red hammer - what could be more subtle and powerful than combining these two elements? After all, the hammer will forge the iron sword with which we will defeat all our enemies as fast as lightning."
DGR_authority_dilemma_desc: "Joseph Stalin did nothing wrong. Che Guevara was a revolutionary hero. Such statements often circulate within the left. But just as the right venerates murderers, the left also has a tendency to place truly unsavory figures on a pedestal. We must be different. I won't allow anyone in our circles to use authorities that are absurd to Poles. And perhaps, in the end, we might even reject Marx as the spiritual progenitor of all communism. After all, Hegelian ideas might suit us better than the ramblings of a privileged Jew who never worked a day in his life."
DGR_private_enterprises_desc: "The cult of entrepreneurs has reached its peak in our late capitalism. The exploitation of ordinary people by pathological liars who consider themselves the backbone of the Polish economy has been staggering. People were forced to live in a free market that guaranteed them nothing, primarily not even survival until the next day. Corporations, private profiteers, fraudsters, and thieves - each of them will face the hand of justice. And that hand wields a sword with which we will give every exploiter what they deserve. Under this communist postulate... I will sign with both hands"
DGR_fallen_monuments_desc: "It's somewhat amusing how certain public institutions in the Dąbrowa Basin suddenly came into possession of long-lost communist monuments following the announcement to restore them. It turns out that decommunization didn't mean destroying symbols or severing ties with the past; it was merely a \"hide it for later, it might come in handy\" operation. And now, it indeed comes in handy. How on earth did they know?"
DGR_living_factory_desc: "A workplace is like a second home. While that doesn't mean you should actually spend the night there, it does imply that major facilities should offer the right kind of amenities. Modern corporations boast about their game rooms, book nooks, and foosball tables. That's great, but we should go further. Our workplaces should feature restaurants, bars, and various public establishments. This not only fills our coffers but also boosts morale significantly. Let the revitalized Defum plant in Dąbrowa Górnicza, now known as The Living Factory, be the prime example. We've refurbished the factory, but the local pubs and eateries remain, serving the workers after, of course, and not during working hours."
DGR_security_service_desc: "I always wanted to have my own security forces. But it seems that this idea will be turned against me. Comrades from the government are working hard to minimize the influence of the army and to have any form of defense against potential internal threats. So maybe it's time to hurry up? Maybe this is a sign from fate? Otherwise, it might soon turn out that all the top officers will either face trials or, at worst, just disappear"
DGR_government_reconstruction_desc: "About time. I've long maintained that this grotesque caricature mistakenly called the People's Front is fit only for the dustbin of history. The chief relic of the Dąbrowa communist era has decreed that the government will undergo a radical overhaul, and that the newly appointed officials will be more in line with the ideals of our state. It's rather amusing how deeply he has insulted his current ministers in the process. If I were in their position, I would take this to heart and flee while there's still a chance to do so on my own terms. But it's not about me, is it?"
DGR_silesian_faction_desc: "I understand that Szwej feels isolated, but forming some kind of group of communist super comrades is senseless. We would only create a criminal regime preoccupied with internal power struggles rather than fighting external enemies. We do not need more communists, especially those unsure whether they want to praise Gierek or Gomułka. Some have even ventured far beyond our eastern border and prefer Mao Zedong. Deng Xiaoping might be tolerable, but Maoists? Next thing I know, we'll be recruiting Pol Pot enthusiasts or adherents of Juche..."
DGR_cult_of_gierek_desc: "If there is someone in the Dąbrowa Basin who could be equated with John Paul II in terms of mythologization and cult, it is undoubtedly comrade Edward Gierek, the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party in the 1970s. He was originally from Sosnowiec, which is already a plus for him. But just ask someone who had the chance to live during those times, and they will tell you that comrade Gierek built the power of the Basin. Thanks to him, Dąbrowa Górnicza developed unimaginably. In 1970, the city's population was 60,000. By the end of his rule, it had already reached 140,000, more than double! His investments laid the foundations for this magnificent city, tamed the industrial potential of the Dąbrowa Basin, and exploited it to the fullest. And for that, people still love him. Because after him... things only got worse."
DGR_partisans_faction_desc: "As a former partisan, I firmly say that we should pursue this path. The path of nationalist-populism. We don't need more communists - what we need is a strong nationalist faction capable of uniting people from various backgrounds under the banner of nationalist rhetoric. That way, it won't matter whether someone follows Stalin or Dmowski; they will be able to integrate into our structures. And, I won't hide it - more allies for me in the Politburo."
DGR_civilian_apparatus_desc: "And as I expected, the Gierek faction is raising their voice, claiming that the army has too many powers, and its freedoms and influence must be radically cut. What the fuck. Clip our wings and then wonder why we're not flying. So far, all they've managed to do is expand the civilian administration and start a civil-military conflict. However, the further we go, the worse it will get. This won't end well - they won't stop, and we won't go down easily. War is coming."
DGR_wide_socialist_front_desc: "I retract what I said about Pol Potists and Jucheists. Because that's indeed the direction we're heading. Fortunately, there don't seem to be any Posadists yet. But knowing the realities of the Politburo, it's only a matter of time. Szwej already has ideas from outer space, so what would it be for him to proclaim a communist revolution brought by aliens? I just want to remind everyone - there was already one such attempt to create a great socialist front. In fact, several. In elections, the left always wanted to form grand coalitions to barely make it over the threshold. And the second one was called the Intercounty. We all remember how that ended."
DGR_progress_fund_desc: "I feel like something like this has been done before. Ah, yes, the Economic Progress Fund already existed. In fact, now I see it has the same goals - funding for farmers who suffered during the wars. Of course, aid will be granted only if they prepare the land for collectivization or fall under the protection of state agricultural enterprises. Clever move, Minister. We all know that farmers won't refuse such hefty subsidies. Just hope this fund lasts longer than its predecessor did, which was barely two years."
DGR_national_socialism_desc: "We have a strong socialist political front. We have nationalist elements in the army. So... I don't want to be the one explaining basic math here, but wouldn't this work out to be something like... National Socialism? Maybe use Socialist Nationalism, it might go down easier. You could have had a true nationalist-populist revolution, but instead, you'll end up with a strange amalgam of popular ideologies seasoned with an antagonistic military. The Soviet Union would be proud. The Third Reich, not so much, despite the name."
DGR_cult_of_moczar_desc: "The legacy of the factional wars in the PRL still affects our society, especially now. On one side, the socialists adhering to Gierek, on the other, we, the nationalist-populist patriots who now need a symbol as strong as the first secretary from Sosnowiec. And there is no better choice than Mieczysław Moczar, who embodied the idea of national-communism and right-wing nationalist tendencies. He will be the figure whose spirit will unite our political environment under one ideology. Let us just cool down with the antisemitic remarks for now."
DGR_military_government_desc: "If comrade Szwej's problem is that the military has far more influence on reality than the government, I have a solution for him. Simply integrate military personnel into the government. Isn't that simple? No more passively accepting idiotic political regulations from above. The National People's Army must become the official executive branch of our country because only this way can true revolution be realized. We will end all internal conflicts within the government and among politicians once and for all. They could use some real military discipline. If we shout loud enough... they'll agree to anything."
DGR_ideological_purity_desc: "Too much of anything is unhealthy. Ideological fragmentation does not serve the unity and strength of our state. We've seen this before with the unified front in the Basin; sooner or later, the leftists will turn on each other, and nothing will stop them from tearing apart even the greatest power. I believe we are ready for phase two. For what I have been building here since I decided that betraying my ideals and joining the Popular Front would be an investment in the future. And the future is now, old man. We stand on the brink of a glorious creation, a glorious revolution which will see this country reborn."
DGR_army_lobbying_desc: "The situation is very simple. We don't enter the government to avoid benefiting from it. And since every gain we make is an investment in the safety of our nation, that's a secondary matter, but a good one that arises from this entire cycle. We won't have to constantly beg the Politburo or threaten them with rebellion to get something. Now, we'll simply take what is rightfully ours, and no ministerial complaints will be able to stop us. We will strengthen the army to the point where all my dreams can be realized. And they are grand ones."
DGR_national_bolshevism_desc: "A time comes in the history of humanity when extraordinary individuals stand at a crossroads and are forced to make difficult choices that will determine the future of many. The National People's Army is ready. Our people within government institutions are also ready. The Palace of Culture will be surrounded. Comrade Szwej will undergo a long, enforced conversation with me. We will clarify a few things, and this time, it won't end as it did before. Lessons were learned here. And let hell consume me if we fail now. The plan has been years in the making; I was born for this moment. The previous failure was merely an element designed to prepare me for today. National Bolshevism, or death."
DGR_5_year_plan_desc: "Economic plans are cool. Instead of chaotic investments in whatever the global economy throws at us and all those theories about supply and demand, we're executing our objectives step by step. The capitalists are furious because, of course, you can't arbitrarily decide in which year to build which sectors of the economy, you have to think about Hayek. I couldn't fucking care less about the Austrians and their damned economic school; nothing enslaves people like capitalism. We know what people need, and we will steer to complete the seventh Five-Year Plan in Polish history. The seventh. The six previous ones clearly showed that the results are positive."
DGR_heavy_industry_nationalisation_desc: "Heavy industry is the backbone of the nation. The prosperity of the state depends on its proper functioning; the entire national economy relies on it. Therefore, we cannot allow a private entity to dictate terms to the state by controlling a key sector of the economy. No. All strategic economic positions and heavy industries must be state-owned to ensure that they work for the nation, rather than enriching some private individual at the expense of the country's future. Only nationalized enterprises will be cared for by their administrators as if they were their most cherished family."
DGR_restore_defunct_plants_desc: "The Balcerowicz Plan and its consequences have been a disaster for the Polish nation. The economy was completely devastated, enterprises went bankrupt in large numbers, and vast swathes of people were left without jobs or prospects for the future. The way in which liberal governments over the following decades attempted to eradicate any signs of Polish economic spirit deserves a separate category of national treason. Entire sectors - mining, metallurgy, shipbuilding, automotive industry - collapsed, yet those responsible for this never faced any consequences. Now they will. We shall, step by step, restore all the fallen enterprises to life. For the people. By the people."
DGR_prefab_apartments_desc: "Liberal governments loved to boast about the number of apartments they built and the wonderful lodgings they created. They were completely indifferent to the fact that ordinary people couldn't afford to live in their magnificent villas. After all, some wealthy investor would eventually come along and invest in real estate. A young person stands no chance of owning their own apartment; if they're lucky, they might afford to rent a tiny room in a six-person house within a cramped block. We need a mass housing program. A mass one, not just three hundred small units once every ten years."
DGR_real_estate_crash_desc: "I don't know if there's a worse creature than a landlord. In our state, the real estate market has essentially collapsed. Total breakdown, thanks to our efforts. And that's a good situation. On the ruins of this sick system, we can build a new world where there's no need to rely on the benevolence of real estate agents who might graciously lower the rent by 2 zlotys per square meter, while increasing utility fees by several hundred zlotys. Enough of flippers, enough of exploitation. Housing is a human right, not a commodity! And for those who so eagerly played with people's lives and mocked this fundamental right, we have special housing. Nice ones, where they'll never have to move out for the rest of their lives."
DGR_pgr_desc: "Farmers have become quite spoiled since the fall of communism. They've absorbed capitalist ideology to the core, which, combined with their socialist roots and demands, has created a terrifying mix. Entitlement, a lack of communal spirit, and no sense of responsibility towards society. The National Agricultural Farms we're introducing today will bring them back to reality and cement the image of the farmer as one who cares for the national community by feeding the entire country, not just themselves. And this is just the beginning of the changes they will face."
DGR_collectivisation_desc: "Privatization of agricultural land was a disastrous move towards liberalism. The conflicts surrounding this event persist to this day, and some farmers simply have no clue about management and shouldn't be involved at all. Therefore, collectivization will help achieve excellent results. Those who can work will work. Those who can manage will manage. Everyone in their place, everyone working hard for the common good. We will start with agriculture. Eventually, we will achieve a true national community where the fruits of labor will serve everyone who is honored to belong to our nation."
DGR_wait_and_see_desc: "The seed of productivity has been sown. The plans have been outlined, the organizations prepared to begin production according to the appropriate standards and agendas. Programs essential for the functioning of the five-year plan have been launched. Everyone knows what they must do.\nYes, there may be some fluctuations in the markets due to the revolutionary changes we are carrying out here. Surely, things will get worse for a while before they get better. But now, all that remains is to stay the course, do our work, and wait... for the fruits of our labor. And then we will savor their taste without having to tighten our belts any longer. It's almost here. Just five years."
DGR_green_utopia_desc: "Bas Tajpan, who recently decided to engage politically under his real name, presented a package of laws today that are intended as a response to the Green New Deal. To me, it seems like he's trying to be holier than the Pope, scrutinizing all European regulations and tightening the screws twice as hard. Banning car production, banning animal husbandry, dismantling our heavy industry and energy sector. I don't know if this man is joking or if he's a damn saboteur. No one in their right mind would take this seriously. Even Comrade Dementia isn't detached enough from reality to make us all frolic in green meadows like Disney princesses in a few years."
DGR_legalizacja_teraz_legalizacja_tu_desc: "From the start, I knew that dealing with this parasite would bring nothing but trouble! Perhaps if he had stayed sober, he wouldn't have had the energy to spout nonsense about the medicinal properties of drugs. And now Minister Krępa thinks it's the perfect time to give the Politburo an ultimatum - legalization of marijuana. So, all those previous ideas were just a smokescreen for this one issue. What frightens me is how many supporters he seems to have. Am I not the only member of the People's Front who has secretly been building an underground power base, waiting for the right moment?"
DGR_appease_them_desc: "If it shuts his damn mouth, so be it - I might even vote for legalization. Let him get high and keep him away from the Politburo meetings, because, as God is my witness, I'll light up a two-meter joint up his ass if he shows up again. And yes, we've got those in the army. They're called short-range missiles. Still, it seems like an appropriate approach to the current problem. People are shouting for something, demanding something. With legalization, at least we'll have control over the substance and its distribution, and we won't create another black market. We've had enough trouble with that already."
DGR_people_are_pissed_desc: "Okay, it seems like people weren't specifically asking for marijuana legalization... because they're still protesting. Today, strike committees were formed at the Myszków and Zawiercie factories. If it's not about marijuana... then what is it? They have housing - somewhat livable. They receive money - what they can buy with it is not our concern; we're in a civil war. Alcohol and cigarettes aren't taxed by us, so they're even cheaper. Security - provided. What could they possibly be missing?"
DGR_strikes_spreading_desc: "Freedom? What is freedom to a bunch of workers whose life goal is to work 8 hours, go to the pub with his mates, and then return to a wife who's rotting at home with the kids? What deeper needs could they possibly have that make democracy essential for them? None. People are divided into the ruling class and those destined to be ruled. Someone is inciting our workers; they aren't capable of such profound thoughts on their own to realize they are being controlled. We'll send security services to every factory to unmask the agitators. In the meantime, we need to start thinking about prevention because factories in Częstochowa, Sosnowiec, and Lubliniec are now joining the strikes..."
DGR_mistrzostwa_w_palowaniu_gornikow_desc: "Good morning, today we begin the National Championships in Beating Workers. The teams from all units of the National People's Army are ready to start the competition, warming up before the games and eagerly awaiting the first whistle from the officiating officers. Before you, the opening match - the 1st Battalion 'Edmund Cedler' will face off against the striking workers from the Zawiercie Steelworks. Who will win? We can only guess, though the favorite is undoubtedly the Red Banner Battalion. We also invite you to the other matches scheduled for this week at the largest industrial facilities in your city. Guaranteed beatings or deportation to a labor camp."
DGR_czolgi_na_hute_desc: "And you, steelworkers of Dąbrowa, you too? Stabbing us in the back? There will be no bread, because there is none. There is vinegar and steel. There will be no freedom either, because you don't need it. But refusal to work in strategically important factories during martial law will be met with the harshest penalty. The Politburo has agreed to execute the most radical of preventive scenarios. Tanks will once again head towards the Katowice Steelworks. And this time there will be no agreements, no Solidarity, and no Round Table. There will be pain, toil, and gnashing of teeth."
DGR_history_repeating_desc: "We cannot afford to be weak again. History tends to repeat itself, but in this case, it's so we can learn from our mistakes and not repeat them. Making concessions with striking workers is the first and greatest mistake one can make in the face of mass protests. We will respond to any sign of resistance to our authority with an iron fist and fire. As the historical maxim goes: \"Any provocateur or lunatic who dares to raise a hand against the people's authority can be certain that authority will sever that hand.\"\n\nCyrankiewicz was right. Today more than ever."
DGR_komu_to_potrzebne_desc: "Legalize marijuana? Why? Who needs it? We did not fight so hard against the criminal drug underground in Dąbrowa just to allow junkies to corrupt society once again. I will never vote for it. We are trying to build a new community, free from substances and addictions, not to surrender to the weaknesses of the underworld. No one will convince me that this is normal and natural. I have seen enough of the effects of this so-called \"wonder drug,\" which drives young people into debt and leaves their minds foggy as if they were perpetually dazed."
DGR_nowy_protest_desc: "In Zielona Park, government documents related to the criminalization of drugs, including marijuana, were just burned. The event was led by Minister Krępa, also known as Bas Tajpan. Then everyone started singing some nonsensical song about how, if they were a magician with three wishes, they would choose a kilo of marijuana. And then another song that goes like, \"Dąbrowa Górnicza, dressed in prohibition. Killed nobody, but still prohibited\" Yes, we all know those worthless artistic pieces. But for a minister to do something like this is a slap in the face of authority. And for this insult, Bas Tajpan will pay dearly."
DGR_diss_na_rzad_desc: "Minister Damian Krępa is no longer a said minister. Once someone starts opposing their own government while still being part of it, it no longer makes sense. Thus, we facilitated his trip to rock bottom by dismissing him immediately. Loyal government units are already heading towards the capital to crush this rebelling scum into dust. I can't wait for the last subversive element to vanish from our streets. The rest will disperse very quickly, and the situation will be under control.\n\nWait... is that idiot really putting on a concert in front of the palace?"
DGR_criminal_hydra_desc: "It's clear that a significant portion of our soldiers come from ghettos and gangster rap communities. One can leave a criminal environment, but mental poverty remains incurable. And it's within such circles that Bas Tajpan found his support. This concerns me greatly because it means that within the National People's Army, there is a cancer that will be hard to cure. Striking workers are breaking the law, so by definition, they have also become criminals. It will be difficult to manage a nation where the majority stands on the other side of the law.\n\nI'm worried about issuing the order to break through to the capital at all costs through blocked streets. There's a risk that soldiers might refuse to carry out the order. If that happens, it would mean they are criminals too... My head is starting to ache from all this."
DGR_SPALMY_BABILON_desc: "Oh shit, oh fuck, o kurwa."
DGR_SADZIC_PALIC_ZALEGALIZOWAC_desc: "Once again, it seems I underestimated the power of the masses, and they can never grasp ideas that go beyond the tip of their damn noses and reach further than their next meal. So, I have what I deserve. And it's strange that I wasn't shot or burned at the stake on the spot, whatever they might have preferred. Locked in some dark cell, I await my fate. Meanwhile, the infamous \"Babylon\" is burning. Literally, the coup was executed amidst the flames of several fires in the capital. And the striking workers haven't even lifted a finger to help us. So, we face a Rastafarian future."

dgr_district.1.t: "District Wars"
dgr_district.1.desc: "Can a so-called government that controls only one district have any legitimacy to govern the entire city? Dąbrowa Górnicza is a highly conflicted place, if not one outright in a state of anarchy. Gangs constantly terrorize people, holding them in an iron grip while fighting among themselves, for control of one or two more already devastated buildings. Huta Katowice has become the last bastion of municipal administration, and it has been taken over by the Communist Party of Poland. How desperate must a person be to decide to hand over power to a group of geriatric dinosaurs from a bygone era? Marcin Bazylak had no choice. Well, he had a choice, but he probably would have ended up hanging from a lamppost in Haller's Park. So, he decided to make a pact with the devil and establish a government of municipal unity in the most powerful steel combine in all of Poland - Katowice Steelworks.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone agrees with this decision, and in the industrial heart of Dąbrowa Górnicza, the government managed to gather fewer than a thousand supporters. Can such a small number of soldiers subdue a city of over a hundred thousand? They will definitely need help and skillful maneuvering between the gangs. It's time to divide and conquer."

unification.14.t: "[GetNewspaper]Dąbrowa Górnicza unifies Zagłębie and Jura!"
unification.14.desc: "In an unexpected turn of events, a little dictatorship hailing from Dąbrowa Górnicza managed to conquer its surrounding territories, overruning the entire northern portion of the Upper Silesian voivodeship. Surrounded by far more powerful enemies, it miraculously held on, and thanks to the Katowice Steelworks and utilizing the power of its industry, it prevailed against the early onslaught, eventually conquering Jura.\nThe strange combination of communism and nationalism has so far proved to be stable and effective enough. It is not entirely clear what the relations between the state's individual factions are, but taking into account their morale - we cannot count on an imminent end to this pact of two devils.\n\nThe People's Front of Zagłębie now has at its disposal the untamed industrial power of the Dąbrowa Basin. It would seem that they will hit Silesia next, but unofficial sources seem to report preparations potentially aimed at a number of different regions."

unificationreg.14.desc: "Lesser Poland has chosen socialism over death, though the decision wasn't exactly free and unanimous, as shots can still be heard around Wawel Castle and in the wilderness of the Tatra Mountains. Still, it has become clear that with their resolute determination to liberate every workplace (especially heavy industry such as steelworks), National Bolshevik troops have triumphed everywhere from Przemsza to Dunajec. Fire blazes from the furnaces once more, along with the spirit of communism aided by nationalist rhetoric.\n\nHowever, reports emerge of a spike in internal disputes, as not all communists wish to adhere to the bloody ideological legacy of Mieczysław Moczar, and even fewer nationalists want to continue to cooperate with those advocating for the same communist ideology that enslaved the country for nearly 50 years. Despite this, heavily funded propaganda aims to temporarily reassure the citizens, but the first cracks are beginning to appear on this grand hybrid project."

unificationsupreg.14.desc: "During times of crisis, makeshift states often end up collapsing, and yet the unusual ideological mix comprising the National People's Army managed to overcome all internal divisions. The solution, proclaimed by the party as a \"vast refreshment of inner quality\", was, in fact, a massive political purge of all political opponents and factions that formed in opposition to the burgeoning project. For quite some time now, the NPA ceased to function only as a paramilitary organization, with the growing party apparatus taking over many civilian governmental functions. For this reason, after a grand military parade in Lublin, Krzysztof Szwej announced the creation of the National People's Republic of Poland, together with the releasing of a manifesto addressed to all of the country's citizens - \"The victory of the Polish working class is approaching, and just like a hundred years ago, the only legitimate government exists here, in Lublin.\""

super.14.desc: "The great struggle of the working class is at last complete. Poland emerges from the ashes as a militaristic country, built upon the pillars of fanatical nationalism and hardline communism, causing widespread panic among neighboring states. Even separately, the two ideologies are enemies of the free world. Together, they form an axis of evil in the eyes of Western powers. \nInside the country, the truth can hardly be distinguished from propaganda, as following a bloody civil war, it is impossible to tell who died as a result of the fighting, and who was forcefully \"redistributed\". In the areas where no shot has been fired for years, internment camps remain, and all political organizations except for the supreme party have been disbanded, with all opposition activity subsequently banned. \nThe National People's Republic of Poland is moving towards another permanent revolution, and with Europe divided and at its weakest, the second half of the 21st century might just belong to National Bolshevism."
