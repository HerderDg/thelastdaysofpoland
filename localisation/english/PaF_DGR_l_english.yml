 POLITICS_MARCIN_BAZYLAK_DESC: "In Dąbrowa Górnicza, there's a long-standing belief that even if the Left ran a monkey for president, after the election, everyone would be swinging from trees. It's well known that in local elections, political views tend to take a backseat. Marcin Bazylak waited seventeen years for his opportunity, standing loyally by Zbigniew Podraza - who had started as a Democratic Left Alliance MP before serving as president of Dąbrowa Górnicza for twelve years. Throughout that time, Marcin remained in Podraza's shadow, dutifully carrying out whatever tasks he was given. But when Podraza could no longer run for another term, Bazylak finally received the official blessing to rule Dąbrowa.\n\nGrinning as widely as he could, he led the city through a series of investments that dug up half the town for over two years. But when it was all finally finished, the results weren't half bad - new roads, new city centre, new railroad station, except for the small detail §tthat the city was bankrupt.§! Fortunately, you don't need to pay off debts when there's no country left to collect them - The Fall allowed President Bazylak to sleep easy. At least until Zbigniew Ziobro showed up knocking at the gates of the Zagłębie. But once again, Marcin was saved - though the Silesian League had abandoned everything east of the Brynica River to its fate, Włodzimierz Czarzasty enthusiastically accepted Bazylak's homage, integrating his city into the framework of the §tIntercounty§! alliance. Once again, Marcin had someone to politely listen to and obey.\n\nBut the real problem for the city was exactly this kind of attitude. Because of it, no one told President Bazylak to take care of his own city's problems - and he never really thought to do so himself, trusting everyone else's judgment but his own. The number of police officers fell to such a low that entire districts descended into chaos, quickly exploited by the growing gangs. The city's economy ground to a halt, like time itself in the district of Ujejsce. Katowice Steelworks - the country's largest metallurgical combine - ceased operations. And yet Bazylak still smiles, waiting on others. The atmosphere in the now-deserted city hall is like the bunker in Hitler's final days - §teveryone knows the end is coming,§! and they're just waiting for the Soviets to arrive. Maybe, soon, someone will finally tell Bazylak what to do. It's unclear whether he'll like that - or if he'll breathe a sigh of relief as he's shown the door."
 POLITICS_KRZYSZTOF_SZWEJ_DESC: "Ideas are bulletproof. But Krzysztof Szwej was never meant to lead a revolution. Before the Fall, he was a quiet ideologue - an eternal student of history and doctrine, the kind who knew every footnote in Das Kapital and every twist in the history of the Polish Left. A loyal cadre of the §tdwindling Communist Party of Poland (KPP),§! Szwej spent years distributing leaflets no one read and attending marches no one watched. He was a relic in a world that had moved on, mocked by liberals, hated by the Right, and barely tolerated by the larger Left. Still, he believed. Always.\n\nWhen the Polish state imploded under the weight of chaos, Szwej emerged from the ashes like a man who had been waiting his entire life for the moment history broke open. He was no longer the obscure ideologue in a red scarf - he was Comrade Szwej, First Secretary of the §tEmergency Workers' Council based in the Katowice Steelworks.§! In the early days of the collapse, he rallied unemployed steelworkers, evicted tenants, and disillusioned youth around a vision of radical equality and worker control. Based in the now-defunct metallurgical giant, Szwej knew the city was moments away from falling into anarchy.\n\nNow, as the new city order struggles to form from the debris of the old, Szwej stands at a crossroads. His ideals are pure, but his men are not. He believes in revolution - but knows too well that revolutions eat their children. And now, his ideological offspring are not unified. He may have to endure many uncomfortable agreements, deals, and compromises for the good of the Popular Front. He has to hope that his vision will become dominant before the §Nstalking wolves§! or §7hedonist reactionaries§! have the chance to ruin his utopian dream.\nHistory, after all, is the only god he's ever believed in - and he has no intention of being forgotten by it.\n\nYet, the worst enemy often is found in the mirror. And looking at it, Szwej notices his dwindling strength, age creeping upon him like a sword of Damocles. §tHis memories are getting blurry.§! But no matter what happens, he promised to keep himself sharp as a knife, and never let anyone know that he might be unfit to rule."
 POLITICS_ALEKSANDER_BARGIELA_DESC: "Such an enormous population of people makes you think that the chance that you're special and unique is close to zero. Aleksander Bargieła never believed in gods, but he believed in §NHistory§! - not as a science, but as a force, a will, a current that chooses men like rivers choose stones to shape. In lecture halls, he studied it with reverence; not to understand it, but to prepare for it. He saw himself not as a student of history, but as its future subject. §NAleksander the Second,§! he called himself in jest - though the jest thinned over time.\n\nBefore the Fall, he was a boy of ideas and ruins. He wandered among forgotten monuments and buried uprisings with the sad eyes of a romantic, convinced Poland had once mattered and could matter again. It was a great parallel to his emotions - crushed and left to wither in this forsaken planet. But the world he lived in was small, sad, and utterly unaware of his inner greatness. That mismatch - between what he believed he was and what the world allowed him to be - made him bitter. In the collapse, Aleksander saw not tragedy, but invitation. He gathered friends, raised banners, and made speeches full of passion. He wore the past like armor, quoting great conquerors and urging his friends to act. §NŁęknice Inquisition§! was born not from ideology, but from myth - his myth. He dreamed of an §NAncient Empire, a state of fearsome legions and poets, pure in blood and will.§! But reality - gray, hungry, uncompromising - soon arrived.\n\nAnd to survive, he bent. He speaks the language of the reds, shares councils with those he despises. Every compromise tasted like bitter medicine. But he still thrives, believing greatness is not forged in comfort, but in contradiction. He sees himself as a vessel of historical inevitability - half prophet, half warlord. Yet beneath the bronze rhetoric lies something tragic: a man who longs to be immortal but cannot stop bleeding. Aleksander Bargieła will either ascend into myth or dissolve into irony. He may wear the crown of a self-made Caesar or vanish beneath the boots of those more consistent, less romantic. But one thing is certain: §the will not go quietly.§! He will howl into the wind, daring §NHistory§! to look away. And perhaps, for a moment, it won't."
 POLITICS_BAS_TAJPAN_DESC: "Bas come from di concrete jungle, bredren. Him was born inna Poland, but spirit always did wander past di block - past di smog, past di struggle, seekin Zion inna riddim. Him chant fire 'pon di mic long before di Fall, when dem call him street poet, §Gganjaman,§! voice of di corner youths. Inna dem days, herb an riddim guide him Irits. Him sing of sufferation, police pressure, system wickedness - yet I-an-I vibes neva die. Babylon try fe label him. Say him a criminal, a hustla, man of shady deals. But Bas, him a §GRastaman§! in disguise, chantin truth inna street tongue. Him find Jah in ganja smoke an bassline, and though him walk through di valley of death riddims, him hold firm inna livity. But time change, bredda. Time twist man soul.\n\nBefore di Fall, Bas seh him cleanse di path. Him walk into politics widdin strange company - runnin wit di Left, Babylon-style, sayin him want uplift di ghetto youths, bring justice inna council halls. Some seh him sold out. Some seh him see di system an waan fix it from within. But truth? Bas nevah let go di street. Di street neva let go of Bas. When di Fall mash down Babylon gates, Bas chant fire again. Him rise as lion, rally di forgotten - ghetto youths, old rebels, herb prophets, soundbwoys turned soulja. Him mash up di Popular Front - system fall like tower of Babel. But him victory nuh pure - him movement, still undefined. Is it Rasta? Is it power grab? Is it Babylon inna dreadlocks?\n\nNow Bas stand at di crossroads. §GDi ganja still burnin.§! Di riddim still beatin. But I-an-I ask: Can di man who chant down Babylon truly build Zion? Or will di past, like shadow inna twilight, always pull back deh soul? Di smoke thick. Di prophecy unclear. But Bas? Him still chantin. Still troddin. §GStill I-n-I.§!"

The legacy of Mieczysław Moczar and Secretary Gierek, who raised this region to the rank of an industrial powerhouse, will never be forgotten."
 DGR_district_wars: "District Wars"
 DGR_district_wars_desc: "The complacent and passive policies of Marcin Bazylak meant that the Fall struck him twice - first, as it did the entire country, and then again, more profoundly, in the hearts of the people of Dąbrowa. Control over the city slipped from the president's hands, and we were cast back into a state of nature - a ceaseless war of all against all. And it is the ordinary people who suffer most from this chaos."
 DGR_district_wars2: "Criminal Hydra"
 DGR_district_wars2_desc: "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce. And our inability to rein over population of our city has led us to the brink of collapse again."
 DGR_narodowa_armia_ludowa1: "Militant Rabble"
 DGR_narodowa_armia_ludowa1_desc: "For a country that claims to take pride in its military strength, all we currently have at our disposal is a ragtag mob, half of them barely armed with whatever we could scavenge. Worse still, their commitment to the ideals represented by our party is highly questionable. And as for the officers? Half of them couldn't organize a picnic, let alone lead a functioning military unit."
 DGR_narodowa_armia_ludowa2: "Militant People's Rabble"
 DGR_narodowa_armia_ludowa2_desc: "For a country that claims to take pride in its military strength, all we currently have at our disposal is a ragtag mob, half of them barely armed with whatever we could scavenge. At least, their commitment to the ideals represented by our party has somewhat improved, and we have a core of working people units that could be our symbols. And as for the officers? Half of them still couldn't organize a picnic, but at least they could put red stars in the decorations."

 DGR_narodowa_armia_ludowa3_desc: "For a country that claims to take pride in its military strength, all we currently have at our disposal is a ragtag mob, half of them barely armed with whatever we could scavenge. The second half is better, because nationalist drill is precise and organised, in opposition to our commissars. Luckily, our officers are beginning to understand their assignments. But to make them all a functioning entity...it's still a long way ahead."
 DGR_red_star_over_church: "Red Star over the Church"
 DGR_red_star_over_church_desc: "Communist states have always had a complicated relationship with the Church. But in Poland, the Catholic Church was powerful enough to overshadow socialist ideals and preserve its identity in the face of revolution - even repression could not break its influence. We must learn from the mistakes of the past and transform the Church into a vessel for spreading our ideology - one that is, in truth, not as incompatible with faith as once believed."

 DGR_5_year_plan_idea: "7th Five-Year Plan"
 DGR_5_year_plan_idea_desc: "The Five-Year Plans pulled Poland out of the darkness of postwar collapse and rebuilt our strength on the international stage. The dark era of capitalism squandered all those achievements in favor of immediate, unrestrained consumerism. We must reject the temptations of the moment and restore long-term, strategic thinking - thinking that will allow us, and above all future generations, to enjoy the true luxuries of a mighty socialist economy."

 DGR_gierek_idea: "Cult of Gierek"
 DGR_gierek_idea_desc: "If the socialist ideal were transported to ancient times, all citizens would undoubtedly proclaim Edward Gierek their leader, their Caesar - whom they would follow even into the deepest pits of hell. The well-earned reverence the First Secretary enjoys in Zagłębie is a testament to how deeply his deeds have been appreciated by the local people. And it is those very deeds that ensure everyone here is ready to answer that one famous question without hesitation: \"Yes! We will help, Comrade Secretary!\""
 DGR_moczar_idea: "Spirit of Moczar"
 DGR_moczar_idea_desc: "The spirit of Mieczysław Moczar lives on - not only in the memories of communist activists, but also in the minds of nationalist thinkers who found deep kinship with the idea of partisanship. For it is impossible to build communism without reflecting on the form it must take. And that form must be clothed in the mantle of national pride and patriotism. Only then can we, as a nation, become a true and indivisible unity."
 DGR_real_estate_crash_idea: "Real Estate Crash"
 DGR_real_estate_crash_idea_desc: "It is always the case that the noble ideals of socialism must confront the relentless efforts of economic reactionaries - those who seize every opportunity to undermine our value system. This time, the reaction has targeted our generous housing program, deliberately sabotaging it and plunging the real estate market into crisis! The state must act decisively - this kind of profiteering on the backs of ordinary people cannot be tolerated!"
 DGR_collectivisation_stage_1: "Collectivisation - Stage 1"
 DGR_collectivisation_stage_1_desc: "Collectivization in Poland was never properly completed. But to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, we will carry it out systematically, carefully, and with due respect for the people who have worked that land for generations. There are no more feudal landlords whose estates we must seize. What we must do now is rekindle the flame of cooperative spirit among the people - and from there, everything else will follow smoothly."
 DGR_collectivisation_stage_2: "Collectivisation - Stage 2"
 DGR_collectivisation_stage_2_desc: "Collectivization in Poland was never properly completed. But to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, we will carry it out systematically, carefully, and with due respect for the people who have worked that land for generations. There are no more feudal landlords whose estates we must seize. What we must do now is rekindle the flame of cooperative spirit among the people - and from there, everything else will follow smoothly.\n\n§tOr not...§!"
 DGR_strikes_1: "Local Strikes"
 DGR_strikes_1_desc: "It was to be expected - wherever progress and revolution emerge, resistance is born. But there is nothing to fear. The anti-socialist agitators will soon learn how an efficient state responds. We cannot afford to yield to the demands of the unionists. Never again."
 DGR_strikes_2: "General Strike"
 DGR_strikes_2_desc: "Strikes have now spread across most of the factories in our country, and it seems the roots of anti-socialist agitation run deeper in the people than we had anticipated. But all is not lost. We must hold our ground with unwavering resolve, so that this wind of so-called \"change\" does not sweep us from the board. We will endure - and every reactionary will receive exactly what they deserve."

 DGR_fabrykapelnazycia_gierek: "Glory of the Workers"
 DGR_fabrykapelnazycia_gierek_desc: "The alliance of the working people of the cities and the countryside is the cornerstone of the socialist idea - around them revolves the life of every properly functioning state. They are the bread and salt of this land. It is they who labor every day to provide for their families and for their nation. In gratitude for their effort, we must ensure they receive proper praise and just compensation."

 DGR_dw_bledow_desc: "Błędów Desert. A real desert in the heart of Poland. There are no pyramids here, though, but there are Pharaohs. Supposedly, because a movie called Pharaoh was filmed here. Additionally, it was a place for training the Afrika Korps. And now...it's roamed by intoxicated bandits. Be wary of mirages and sandworms.\n\n§CHeadquarters:§! Eurocamping Błędów"
 DGR_dw_centrum_desc: "Sztygarka School always had an eye for talent. Those talented people were often hired by local organised crime. Nowadays, they sit freely in the Palace of Culture and think that they are the lords of this city.

 DGR_dw_huta_desc: "Katowice Steelworks - currently the operational center of the Communist Party of Poland. The largest metallurgical complex in the country. They thought they had banished us here to die. But this is no curse - it is a gift. The greatest legacy of socialism and the working people.

 DGR_dw_leknice_desc: "The western part of the city, Dąbrowa Lake District, is now home to a nationalistic and aggressive gang calling themselves Łęknice Inquisition. They have subjugated lesser bandits from Antoniów and Piekło, which are now a part of their raiding party. Heavily motivated politically, an alliance with Young Steelworkers against them is a recommended option.\n\n§CHeadquarters:§! Piekło"
 DGR_dw_reden_desc: "Drug gangs took over the central part of our city. The main one, Crank Kings, is a bunch of juveniles with fantasies of becoming conquerors now that they're controlling Reden. We can form several tactics here: skipping the Korczak line, pincer movement into the devil's den - Haller's Park, or simply roll our troops into the City Hall and get our symbolic victory.\n\n§CHeadquarters:§! Elementary School No.20"
 DGR_dw_slawkow_desc: "Before the Fall, Sławków did not officially belong to Dąbrowa, but it had always been part of our rightful territory. Their hatred for us ran so deep that instead of integrating into our city's structures, they chose to join as an enclave of Będzin County. And now, once again, they commit a treacherous act of secession. A population indoctrination program is required.\n\n§CHeadquarters:§! Sławków 'City' Hall"
 DGR_dw_strzemki_desc: "Strzemieszyce has committed a betrayal even greater than Sławków's - at least their demands can be rationalized. But Strzemieszyce, a part of Dąbrowa since time immemorial (since 1975), now leads the way as treacherous secessionists. The city gave them everything, and this is how they repay us. They must be crushed with the fire of our guns.\n\n§CHeadquarters:§! PKP Energetyka Southern Facility"
 DGR_dw_trojmiasto_desc: "Dąbrowa Tricity - Łosień, Łęka, and (Ł)okradzionów - is no cradle of civilization. These are rural, forested lands whose only real value lies in the Economic Zone in Tucznawa. The rest has been taken over by hunting associations, who now prey on more than just wild animals. Perhaps that's why no gangs dared to venture there. But we must root them out of the forests.\n§CHeadquarters:§! Łeverest"
 DGR_dw_zabkowice_desc: "An anarchist gang composed of young criminals, driven by little more than a taste for cheap wine and a penchant for urban vandalism. Though they mirror the worst ideals of Antifa, they have proven themselves effective in battling fascist elements.

 DGR_dw_zadupie_desc: "The northern outskirts of the city with Ujejsce and Trzebiesławice are as wild as the people who inhabit them.

Most of them were simply gangs and raiders, but there are also some ideological groups of fanatics. Remnants of Dąbrowa Górnicza local parliament were disbanded and forced to flee before some bandits could hang them up on the nearest lantern.

 DGR_OL_convoy_to_cargo_desc: "PKP Cargo in Strzemieszyce is a very important freight hub for supplies; we can't just leave it in the hands of the rebels. Fortunately, the railway from Huta Katowice leads straight to the station. All we need to do is send them a Trojan train."
 DGR_OL_cutoff_s1: "Cut off the S1 Expressway"
 DGR_OL_cutoff_s1_desc: "The S1 Expressway cuts through our city in half, with us effectively separated from the main urban area. Moreover, by controlling the interchange at Sulno, we will be able to follow National Road 94 through all of Strzemieszyce. And if we happen to gain control of the micro-steel mill and fuel tanks in the process? All the better."
 DGR_OL_march_on_basilica: "March on Strzemieszyce Basilica"
 DGR_OL_march_on_basilica_desc: "It's time to settle the score with the rebels from the Strzemieszyce People's Republic. Let our popular action be the final act in the history of Strzemieszyce separatism and put an end, once and for all, to their dreams of seceding from Dąbrowa Górnicza!"
 DGR_OL_disband_organisations: "Disband social and political organizations"

 DGR_OB_leap_on_tucznawa: "Leap on Tucznawa"
 DGR_OB_leap_on_tucznawa_desc: "Tucznawa is a rural district that purely exists because a road to Zawiercie goes through it. But it has raised its standards as of late, with the expansion of the Tucznawa Economic Zone, and this should be our priority. We should seize this zone with one lightning strike."
 DGR_OB_leap_on_leka: "Leap on Łęka"
 DGR_OB_leap_on_leka_desc: "Łęka is even worse than the rest of those backwater areas. There is nothing here, and I dare say that the inhabitants don't even know that Poland has fallen. That will be one hell of a shock therapy, but at least resistance will be minimal."
 DGR_OB_pincer_resistance: "Pincer down the resistance"
 DGR_OB_pincer_resistance_desc: "Now that we control some areas of the Dąbrowa Tricity, we can use our field advantage to press into Łosień and Okradzionów from almost all sides simultaneously. They won't know what hit them."
 DGR_OB_nationalization_of_forests: "Nationalisation of the forests"
 DGR_OB_nationalization_of_forests_desc: "Forests for a long time in our history has been a nest of reactionary bandits, partisans and criminals. This practice can't continue.

 DGR_OW_cutoff_euroterminal: "Cut off the Euroterminal"
 DGR_OW_cutoff_euroterminal_desc: "Following the railway tracks from Strzemieszyce, we can effectively split the rebellious Sławków Republic in half, allowing us to divert their attention and undoubtedly create chaos among their ranks. What will they defend more vigorously: the city or the Euroterminal?"
 DGR_OW_send_armored_convoys: "Send armored convoys to the city"
 DGR_OW_send_armored_convoys_desc: "National Road 94 leads us straight through the heart of Sławków. Convenient, isn't it? All we need to do is send a few armored vehicles down this road to take control of the entire city. There will be no resistance"
 DGR_OW_arrest_separatists: "Arrest separatist leaders"
 DGR_OW_arrest_separatists_desc: "Sławków reactionary bandits, only mistakenly referred to as an army, fled to the Euroterminal, leaving the city to its fate. Interestingly, the dignitaries behind the civilian part of this rebellion were not informed of the retreat, so it's time for some spring cleaning!"
 DGR_OW_teach_them_lesson: "Teach them a lesson"
 DGR_OW_teach_them_lesson_desc: "The assault on the Euroterminal may prove to be a bloody undertaking. But this blood is necessary for the rebuilding of our city; the wealth amassed there will allow us to rise from our knees, and unlocking the freight route will finally enable our development. Remember - no rebels."
 DGR_OW_state_of_emergency: "Declare state of emergency in Sławków"
 DGR_OW_state_of_emergency_desc: "Rebellion in Sławków can't be repeated. All of those warmongering secessionists shall be prosecuted, all accomplices shall be brought to justice, and people will have to submit themselves to mandatory reeducation. It's an emergency. And we will act on it."

 DGR_OP_envoy_to_metallurgists: "Send an envoy to Young Steelworkers"
 DGR_OP_envoy_to_metallurgists_desc: "We should send an emissary to those hobos. They are unruly and disorganised, but there is a slight ideological compatibility between them and us. Together, we could strike down the fascist hydra in Łęknice. And then? Well. Time will tell."
 DGR_OP_deal_with_devil: "Deal with the devil?"
 DGR_OP_deal_with_devil_desc: "That really is unheard of. We didn't have much hope for the Ząbkowice rabble, but...pragmatism must take its way. To quote the classic - If I cannot bend the heavens, then I shall move the powers of hell. And this time devil wears a nationalistic mask."
 DGR_OP_approve_joint_strike: "Approve the joint strike"
 DGR_OP_approve_joint_strike_desc: "Truth be told, this is wrong on many levels, nonetheless, we're preparing a joint operation against the Young Steelworkers. Even now we see that this cooperation will be a painful road. But we fight with the army we have."
 DGR_OP_secure_industrial_zone: "Secure the industrial zone"
 DGR_OP_secure_industrial_zone_desc: "Not much is left of old industrial facilities in Ząbkowice. But what is, we shall seize to cripple their operations. Honestly, we should be surprised if there is even any operation there at all, and not just another meth lab or moonshine shack."
 DGR_OP_siege_big_squat: "Siege of the Big Squat"
 DGR_OP_siege_big_squat_desc: "Ząbkowice House of Culture, or the 'Big Squat' as it's now called, has never been more ruined. And yet, it's a home for many hedonist squatters. We're far from moral preaching like catholics do, but even we have to admit - it's not a very socialist way. It needs to be cleaned. Thoroughly."
 DGR_OP_forced_indoctrination: "Forced indoctrinations of bandits"
 DGR_OP_forced_indoctrination_desc: "Dealing with bandits is always a double-edged sword. You can cut yourself (or more precisely - they will cut you) if you're not careful. You need to adjust your level of intelligence to theirs and then, with a sense of familiarity, begin to teach them our ideology. Explaining socialism to them like they're five. Which they are, mentally."
 DGR_OP_incorporation_of_nationalists: "Incorporation of nationalist militias"
 DGR_OP_incorporation_of_nationalists_desc: "If one said 'A', then 'B' must follow. Though the Politburo still hesitates about this idea, the terms of our contract were clear, and now we need to integrate nationalist militias into our armed forces. It's not going to end well."

 DGR_OM_assess_situation: "Assess the situation"
 DGR_OM_assess_situation_desc: "It's a horrible mess, really. Gołonóg is no longer an unruly district with squabbling wannabe criminals. It's a full-on turf war of gangs. And there isn't any possibility of negotiating with them. Four districts. Four gangs. Lots of dead bodies. There is also Spisak District. We need to avoid that one and hope that they simply won't bother us."
 DGR_OM_staging_point: "Secure the staging point on Gołonóg Hill"
 DGR_OM_staging_point_desc: "Gołonóg Hill despite having a church is a really good strategic position. From the top of it we can see the scale of Gołonóg war. It's staggering. But now, we have to grind our way through those districts. Maybe if we conquer enough of them, we can force them into submission. Or just eliminate them all. Easier that way."
 DGR_OM_cedler: "Cieszkowski District"
 DGR_OM_cedler_desc: "Formerly called Cedler District (we're bringing that one back when we get there), doesn't have much to offer except blocks and... no, that's pretty much it. It's not going to be an easy ride."
 DGR_OM_kasprzak: "Kasprzak District"
 DGR_OM_kasprzak_desc: "Kasprzak District is a relatively big one. And it's frontally positioned to our staging points on the Gołonóg hill, which would make assault almost impossible. But fortunately, Podlesie and S1 Expressway offer us the perfect way to sneak into the heart of the district and raise hell."
 DGR_OM_broadway: "Broadway District"
 DGR_OM_broadway_desc: "Millennial District, to be precise. It's focused on its perpetual war with Manhattan, but it has a clear advantage in the form of a market where you could always buy the greatest hits from Eastern Europe. And this market has adjusted to this new reality, so instead of russian carpets, now you have russian guns."
 DGR_OM_manhattan: "Manhattan District"
 DGR_OM_manhattan_desc: "It ain't exactly New York, but its population density certainly makes up for its lack of supplies. Thus, this allows them to flood their neighbors across Piłsudski Street with human waves of relentless gangsters. Here, Podlesie also offers up a sneaky way into Manhattan itself."
 DGR_OM_force_submission: "Force them into submission"
 DGR_OM_force_submission_desc: "We certainly proved our merit here, and they will have to disband their guerillas and gangs. Won't they? Either way, we should end this tiring hide and seek game and roll our troops here seizing control once and for all. And hope that Spisak District won't wake up."
 DGR_OM_rebuilding_program: "Start the rebuilding program"
 DGR_OM_rebuilding_program_desc: "Gołonóg faced a difficult time, and many blocks were devastated. There wasn't a night without some apartment burning down, and now, as the rightful rulers of this district, it falls on us to do the rebuilding. Well, it's a good thing that we won't lack in the workforce then."

 DGR_OA_around_korczak_line_desc: "Korczak Line is a heavily fortified series of blocks behind the Majakowski Alley, posing a great threat in the potential frontal assault. Thankfully, we have just the way to skip it completely, rendering them useless."
 DGR_OA_assault_on_city_hall: "Assault on City Hall"
 DGR_OA_assault_on_city_hall_desc: "Though the City Hall and 'Pentagon' are under Kings control, they are stretched too much there, and they can't fill the garrison there completely. Thus, it's an obvious first-strike target. And it's not only a strategic aim, but a symbolic one."
 DGR_OA_battle_for_haller_park: "Battle for Haller Park"
 DGR_OA_battle_for_haller_park_desc: "Why settle for arduous assault when we can just strike them in their nest? One battle and they're done. Haller's Park is a very good place for that battle, because it stretches from the seat of the Kings power as far as a street away from the Palace of Culture."
 DGR_OA_secure_reden: "Secure the rest of Reden"
 DGR_OA_secure_reden_desc: "Reden is not a monolith, but rather a series of smaller districts, each of them difficult in their own way. Adamiecki District, 1st May District, Kołłątaj Street - we need to adapt our tactics to these different circumstances and clear them of any resistance."
 DGR_OA_hunt_leaders: "Hunt down gang leaders"
 DGR_OA_hunt_leaders_desc: "They poisoned our society. They threatened our families. They claimed themselves equal to kings and lords. And we all know what socialist doctrine has to say about high and mighty. They shall be struck down with the power of the people, for the people."
 DGR_OA_declare_amnesty: "Declare amnesty for the rest"

 DGR_OZ_strike_on_sztygarka: "Strike on Sztygarka School"
 DGR_OZ_strike_on_sztygarka_desc: "Sztygarka School together with a museum next to it are the seat of power of Steigers. Cut the head, and they will just run aimlessly. And also, we could really use those old weapons stored there."

 DGR_forgotten_city_desc: "You could ask a random person about Dąbrowa Górnicza, and they won't point out its location. At most, they might mention something about an orgy at the parish house. We are forgotten by God, and he's what's most missing in the Red Basin. Instead we have him. President Marcin Bazylak. In the face of a crumbling state, he crumbles the most. He didn't even try to save the situation as it completely overwhelmed him. The formal alliance with Sosnowiec and the other cities in the region was forced upon him, and he had no say in it. Not that it would help him. He sits locked in his city hall like King Popiel in his tower.\n\nAnd the mice and rats are coming. Dąbrowa will be taken over by the law of the jungle, and the strongest tribe will take it all."
 DGR_last_man_standing: "Last Man Standing" 
 DGR_last_man_standing_desc: "Fantastic. Everything went according to plan. Control over the city hall doesn't mean control over the city, but it's just the first piece of the puzzle. The Palace of Culture, Katowice Steelworks, PKP Cargo. Strategic infrastructural, administrative, and cultural nodes. This is the key to complete control over the city. Even one as unruly as Dąbrowa. The only problem might be clearing huge swaths of land that we simply don't have enough people to control.\n\nSend tanks to the Steelworks! Just like in the good old days."

 DGR_sztygarka_robbery_desc: "In the very center of the city sits a perfect Trojan horse, ready to be used by those daring enough to aim high. And that's exactly what we will do. Tanks. Transporters. Museum weapons, old but still functional. And since there's a gas station on the way with some fuel left... I'll only need a few good men.\n\nAnd we'll go on a trip. We'll visit Mr. President. And he will agree to everything we put in front of him. Why? Let's say we'll have very strong arguments."

So, we lost everything. Well, almost. We managed to escape with a handful of our people to Łęknice, where our last major base is located. Our fortune will change soon. How could it not, since power in the city has been given to Joseph Stalin's Supreme Geriatric Council? Bazylak really hit his head when he fell out of that tram. Handing over power to the communists is a brilliant shot in the foot. Moreover, they are surrounded on all sides by hostile gangs and partisans. And we are one of them.\n\nOnce we rebuild our strength and destroy them, we'll still have to deal with the separatists from Strzemieszyce and Sławków. They hate our city so much they are ready to see it burn. Not on our watch. Even if we have to team up with the red devil against the traitors of Dąbrowa unity!"

Lumpenproletariat to the fullest. This so-called \"People's Front\" will fall apart from within sooner than it will be able to defeat anyone outside. Better for us. In that case, returning to power and full strength is a matter of weeks, not months. We need to be ready when the reds start tearing each other apart for the last scraps of the city. Of course, as long as grandpa Szwej doesn't forget where he is and why he's there."

And thanks to our faith in our values, soon at the steelworks it will be better to be dead than red..."

After all, Czarzasty is the greatest right-wing patriot of the entire Republic, no one has destroyed left-wing movements and party structures on the left side of the barricade as well as he has. I say let him go. Even Czarzasty, despite his ineptitude in recognizing that it's already the 21st century, won't be stupid enough to get involved in any help for the lost cause that Bazylak presents. Especially since he is now working for Szwej, and he has similar grudges against Czarzasty as every straight thinking person on the left side. I won't even mention Jaworzno, giving any attention to those bandits is a crime against common sense."

 DGR_supress_dissent_desc: "Something festers in the middle of the Katowice Steelworks. Something that we have failed to see. Intelligence reports that our beloved People's Front is gathering strength and is on the brink of launching a special military operation. We must prepare for the eventual repulsion of their invasion into our controlled districts. The problem is, they could go in any direction, and we don't know what's happening in that communist hole.\n\nThe closed gates of the Steelworks will open once again. The red flood that will pour over the entire city must be stopped. But their numbers make it likely that it will only be a small rain rather than a flood."

 DGR_central_planning_commision_desc: "Our industry has died and now it stinks. Oh, wait. It's just the standard smells coming from the steelworks. The industrial plants in the city have shut down along with the rest of the country. The decaying carcass of the Dąbrowa economy is a testament of this city itself. At least the sky has become somewhat bluer. If only people weren't dying of hunger, this might be a plus. Apparently, a Central Planning Commission has been established to revive the economic power of the heart of the Zagłębie\n\nBrick by brick, machine by machine, the spirit of people's thrift will be used to produce 200% of the norm, in exchange for hunger rations just to fuel the communists' war efforts. But soon we will be back at the top of the rankings. Of cities with the highest air pollution..."
 DGR_restore_palace_of_culture: "Restore Palace of Culture"
 DGR_restore_palace_of_culture_desc: "Zagłębie's Palace of Culture. The impaired younger brother of Warsaw's Palace of Culture, a mediocre caricature of what was supposed to be a powerful cultural symbol of the region but became just a black hole absorbing millions for renovations. Another great renovation is ahead. The communists, taking over the center, will want to complete the vision of our graciously reigning ex-president Bazylak and make the Palace of Culture a true government center.\n\nIn fact, it's not such a stupid idea. If it were transformed into a likeness of the Presidential Palace, it could serve as a strong symbol of the city's power and its reborn glory. Except that Szwej couldn't sit there... Even Jimmy Hendrix sitting next to the palace in Freedom Square can see that he's not leader material deserving of such a grand palace."

In this case, maybe the enemy of my enemy is not entirely my friend, but I can only tell them one thing - BURN THIS PLAGUE TO THE GROUND.\n\nReden is one of the districts most infected with the virus of deviant crime. Only the northern areas of Gołonóg with Spisak and Łączna streets together with Mydlice can directly compete with Reden in the category of \"districts where you don't want to live.\" I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm glad the People's Front \"liberated\" Reden, even if only temporarily. There's a fraction of hope that these areas will experience the long-awaited and deserved peace without major battles in Haller's Park or dealers from Orzeszkowa street lurking on every corner."
 DGR_raise_popular_militias: "Raise Popular Militias"
 DGR_raise_popular_militias_desc: "No one wants to die for the red dream. Volunteers here are as rare as hen's teeth, as we have learned ourselves. And what can the communists say? Like it or not, they have to start recruiting. But how? Encouraging people to flee to the Steelworks. But with what? Fruit Thursdays? A solid paycheck? Tons of crude steel from the steelworks? The communist revolution? They might try to call up the steelworkers, but there aren't many left. Their only way out will be forcibly enlisting ordinary citizens. Good luck bringing them from areas controlled by gangs. We must be doubly vigilant so that agents of the revolution don't roam our lands, stealing our people. Once upon a time, black Volgas were real boogeymen... the world has moved forward but not the communist parties. Only the car models have changed."
 DGR_przyjazn_coking_plant: "Restore 'Przyjaźń' Coking Plant"
 DGR_przyjazn_coking_plant_desc: "Once the most modern coking plant in the country. Then taken over by the bean counters of Jastrzębie Coal Company. The country has fallen, but the corporate rats still operate in the plant. Whoever takes over this area will have quite a hard nut to crack, mostly because the coking plant is in a state of decay. But if it could be restored to full functionality - it would fuel our economy immensely. Among the smoke and pyrolysis, the main foundation of the city's economy will arise. Once again. The name of it still bothers me, though."
 DGR_tucznawa_zone: "Tucznawa Investition Zone"
 DGR_tucznawa_zone_desc: "Dąbrowa is very spacious. After all, it was once the 9th largest city in Poland for a reason. But of course, Gdynia and Świnoujście claimed the sea as a city land, and we fell to 11th place. Nothing lost, this will change soon. Shipyard workers cannot compete with steelworkers. But back to the point - we have a lot of land to manage. That is why, for several years, a huge investment zone has been designated in Tucznawa to be filled with various industrial plants. These areas will be the perfect complement to the iron core of the city's economy."
 DGR_dzierzynski_steelworks: "Renovate Dzierżyński Steelworks"
 DGR_dzierzynski_steelworks_desc: "Bank Steelworks. Now it is a shithole, but under communism, it was a magnificent factory. No wonder they decided to return to its former name - Feliks Dzierżyński Steelworks. It is not as large and efficient as Katowice Steelworks, but its history dates back to the times when cannons for the January insurgents were forged there. Cieszkowski was on point with those guns. He knew how to make good use of the potential of this plant. Even the Nazis, who during the war assembled their tanks like Panthers, Tigers, and even parts for V1 and V2 rockets there, appreciated it. Interesting... maybe some archival technical documents could be found there..."
 DGR_monuments_of_old_times: "Desert Trip"
 DGR_monuments_of_old_times_desc: "Everyone really thinks that Błędów and the Błędów Desert are one and the same. The truth is, the name comes from this place, but only a small, heavily forested piece is within the city's borders. The rest is already in Lesser Poland. Fortunately, the Ziobrists don't go to the desert, so the gang called the Pharaohs operates in areas larger than any other. But it would be more than enough to drive into Błędów with an old tank for them to capitulate. I don't think they would even resist. They're just there for show, nothing more."
 DGR_rastafarian_question: "Rastafarian Question"
 DGR_rastafarian_question_desc: "Eating, drinking, smoking joints. Dancing, revelry, and frolic. And this is not a scene from Adam Mickiewicz but the situation in Zielona Park, where a real Rastafarian commune has emerged. It's hard to even call them a gang... because they just sit there and basically don't compete with anyone. Probably because they are constantly high. Plus, the blessing of People's Front Minister Damian Krępa means they enjoy government protection. They are harmless in their activities. If we leave them there, they won't even know what's going on around them. Only God knows if they are even aware that Poland no longer exists. Well, we could also just scatter them and none would be the wiser..."
 DGR_undermine_opposition: "Root Out Separatist Movements"
 DGR_undermine_opposition_desc: "Traitors, traitors, all of them traitors! Not only was Sławków once part of Dąbrowa Górnicza, but they apparently didn't like it so much that they decided to secede and join Będzin County, which they don't even border! Their impudence knows no bounds. Now, when they have once again become part of our great city - they have again caused a rift in unity and rebelled. Additionally, they have infected the residents of Strzemieszyce with their separatist virus. Every independence activist must pay for their crimes. Every whisper of freedom should be drowned in blood. Enough of the dreamers' fantasies. We are all Dąbrowians."
 DGR_every_worker_a_soldier: "Every Worker a Soldier"
 DGR_every_worker_a_soldier_desc: "Young Steelworkers. Another stain on the city map that is only suitable for disposal in the blast furnace no. 2 at the Steelworks. But apparently, according to the communists, everyone is a potential carrier of the revolution. Sounds contagious indeed. Ząbkowice has always been a hotel for workers who worked in nearby plants, and not much has changed. Only I wonder - if you call up workers as soldiers... who will work in these plants to produce equipment for the soldiers? Something doesn't add up, Comrade Szwej."
 DGR_negotiate_with_li: "Negotiate with ŁI"
 DGR_negotiate_with_li_desc: "When in fear, God is dear. The People's Front officially wants to negotiate with us. Mainly because the young squatters from Ząbkowice do not share their outdated point of view. Hell has truly frozen over. Someone trusted the horseshoe theory as the ideal way out of their problems too much. I won't say nationalism in both cases is not similar...and...no, it's a betrayal. But... maybe? Maybe this is the chance? To participate in forming a new Dąbrowian government, transforming the city in our image and likeness. We would have the opportunity to achieve the influence we originally lacked. And when the right moment comes - blow up the system from within and reign unchallenged. It is a tough nut to crack because with each passing moment, I see more and more sense in this madness. Only how to convince my people that this is the way?"
 DGR_heavy_machinery_production: "Gangers into Militias"
 DGR_heavy_machinery_production_desc: "What is the difference between a gangster and a soldier? Mainly the equipment. Well, in the case of communist militias, the only difference is that they are led by ideological officers, not the biggest thug in the neighborhood who dares to call himself the big boss. But even the best officer is useless when he has idiots from the ghetto under his command, whose only skill is to assault an old lady in a group of five. Because if someone shows up who can stand up to them, then the boys will run for the hills!\n\nThey need firm officers with an iron hand and iron will who can make men out of these gangsters. Otherwise, I don't see any grand victories for this army for quite some time."
 DGR_katowice_steelworks: "Complete Restoration of Katowice Steelworks"
 DGR_katowice_steelworks_desc: "Katowice Steelworks has transformed from a collapsing post-fall industrial plant into the center of armed revolution. Now that the whole city is relatively peaceful, this giant must be restored to its nominal processing power. The communists can leave, and the workers return to work. Furnaces and chimneys must be renovated. Rolling mills repaired. The power plant integrated into the municipal network. Conveyor belts restarted. There is much to be done to make Dąbrowa's pride the most powerful industrial plant in the country again. Exactly. Dąbrowa's. Katowice should disappear from the name. We shouldn't give the Silesians any reasons to be proud.\n\nEvery builder of the renewed Huta Katowice will be a pioneer of success. But to achieve this... SHUT UP AND WORK OVERTIME!"
 DGR_our_position: "Our Position in Dąbrowa Basin"
 DGR_our_position_desc: "Bazylak got us into this sick alliance. Come on, Marcin - it's going to fucking explode. If leftists hate anything more than rightists, it's other leftists whose ideology differs even a little. Antifa, socialists, communists, anarchists. Only one of these ideas will ultimately triumph, and the rest will have to be turned to dust. Not to mention that there are other nationalists in the north. And Ziobro, even though he got hit in his balls once and has his own problems now, he still remains an unpredictable entity. We can only rely on ourselves. Which is ironic because I can't even trust other members of the government. But we play with the cards we've been dealt."
 DGR_nationalist_communist_paramilitary: "Natonalist-Communist Paramilitary"
 DGR_nationalist_communist_paramilitary_desc: "It happened. The official signing of the nationalist-communist alliance. Our units will maintain complete autonomy within the newly created National People's Army. Szwej turned out to be weak, agreeing to most of our demands. Normally I would see this as a trick or a stratagem, but I can recognize when someone has insincere intentions. Here, all I saw was desperation. Democrats will not follow the old order. The modern left won't either. This city is thoroughly sick. And we are the only cure.\n\nNow everyone will know the price of messing with us. Our stark resolve will revive the spirit of Dąbrowian people thanks to our methods. Soon enough we shall be in charge of the whole National People's Army. Oh, how they will all weep then. Political ideology won't matter when you have the strength of a grand army to back you up."
 DGR_congress_of_bedzin: "Congress of Będzin"
 DGR_congress_of_bedzin_desc: "What I feared may come to pass sooner than I expected. The second Congress of Intercounty will take place in Będzin. Everyone will be there with their most important dignitaries. I will not be sidelined, I must have a place in the Dąbrowian delegation. Not that I plan something very funny. But I would very much like to see the faces of Czarzasty, Żukowska, and Konieczny when they realize who is sitting on the other side of the table. Although on the other hand, 50 hours of boring bullshit containing the imperative of equality and the socialist idea makes me nauseous already. If the Intercounty somehow survives, we must take as much as possible for ourselves. \n\nIf not... good riddance."
 DGR_industrial_heart: "Industrial Heart of Zagłębie"
 DGR_industrial_heart_desc: "Finally, all elements of the industrial puzzle have been united into one steel fist. The reborn heart of Zagłębie beats to the rhythm of progress. Among machines, smoke, and steel, the entire economic power of Dąbrowa Górnicza works for the benefit of the nation. The Dąbrowian nation. We are the custodians of industrialization and pioneers of the revolution. This force cannot be stopped anymore. With each successive completed workers' plan, the army and society grow in wealth.\n\nNow we must focus all our productive power on one goal. War is coming. The lightning is red, the hammer will forge an iron sword. The National People's Army is the child of the power of Dąbrowa's heavy industry. And thanks to these plants, the rest of Poland will feel what Zagłębie Dąbrowskie is capable of."
 DGR_aftermath: "Aftermath"
 DGR_aftermath_desc: "I can't say that I did not expect this. However, the intensity of the socialist outcry that took place in the final hours of the congress in Będzin exceeded my wildest expectations. Traitors of the revolution, Nazis in red robes, sellouts, brown fascists, useful PiS idiots, volksdeutsche, smiling clowns. The list of invectives that all sides threw at each other was enormous. And all this in a few minutes during the last meeting. We were on the verge of an agreement. We were this close. But the masks finally fell off, and no one hid the fact that we despise each other.\n\nIntercounty is a dead corpse on which crows and ravens will feed. The time of war conflagration has come. There is no turning back from this path. Time for action."
 DGR_glory_parade: "Rose Alley Parade"
 DGR_glory_parade_desc: "Our combat value may be negligible, but at least we can march proudly. This is also a symbol of hope for the city's population. Hope that there finally exists a formation that will defend their lives. Even if in its ranks are those who not long ago would gladly take that life from them. Never mind. Guarded by disciplined officers, the soldiers will be obedient because that is the only thing they are morally capable of. You only need to be more menacing than their previous gang leaders; the mere power of authority will do the rest. Such a mixture, seasoned with the latest military vehicles freshly released by the Dąbrowa steel mills, will march today along Rose Alley towards the city center to pledge loyalty to the People's Front in front of the Palace of Culture. If only these idiots do not trip over their own feet."
 DGR_working_people: "For the Working People!"
 DGR_working_people_desc: "I never thought I would ever be an advocate of working-class pride. But at a time when it is so closely intertwined with the military and nationalist spirit, I am able to undertake a few rhetorical liberties. Whatever one might say about the communists - the working class must be properly nurtured because it constitutes the core of every well-functioning state. And we fight for a better tomorrow especially for them. Because if the working class is taken care of, so will the families they work to provide. And from there, it's just a short step to a happy society."
 DGR_emergency_mobilization: "Emergency Mobilization"
 DGR_emergency_mobilization_desc: "War in the metropolis will be quite specific. Already at this moment, we can see the troops of our new opponents on the other side of some streets. Mydlice will be a very critical point; we must conduct a very strong mobilization there. After all, people do not have to fight for the idea of communism if they can fight for their home and the safety of their families. This will certainly work. In other areas, we are separated by large forested terrains like Zielona Park or Zagórze Forest. This will allow for some tactical freedom...but we still need to recruit everyone capable of defending our reborn home."
 DGR_war_communism: "War Communism"
 DGR_war_communism_desc: "Solving our problems will not be easy, so temporarily we must undertake certain measures. Of course only for the duration of the war. No one expects it to last long, so they will grit their teeth and meekly comply. Oh...if only they knew they were going into a total war. All plants work at 200% capacity to fulfill all orders for the army. We will need 300% if we are to fight multiple opponents simultaneously. We must squeeze the last drop of sweat from every small workshop. Only overwhelming force and a crushing blow will allow us to emerge from this chaos unscathed. And since the army will now be the main decider of the state's fate, comrade Szwej doesn't need to be so aware of many things.\n\nAll power to the army. This is where the fun begins..."
 DGR_popular_army: "For the Popular Army!"
 DGR_popular_army_desc: "With the constant influx of fresh recruits, we can slowly phase out the criminal elements in favor of the youth, who are perfectly suited to building an army that believes in its ideals. National ideals. And we will be the sculptors who will shape them into perfect soldiers fulfilling the moral imperative of the revolution. But not necessarily a socialist revolution. Not in its strict sense. The political brass may be socialist, but we are the element that will bring victory for our homeland. And they will all depend on us for securing the future. And that future will not be populist. It will be national-populist!"
 DGR_to_arms_comrades: "To Arms Comrades!"
 DGR_to_arms_comrades_desc: "One might want to hum \"Arise, you wretched of the earth,\" but it seems they sing that in Sosnowiec. At least, sometimes you can hear it from their soldiers stationed in Zagórze. The pawns are positioned on the board, and each of us waits to see who will make the first move. In this duel of gunslingers, however, we must be wise. If we strike first, it may turn out that a third party will strike us at the worst possible moment. Dear officers, you must be clever and cunning. We have the most territory to cover, but we must turn this into our advantage, as maneuverability will be the key. Striking strategic points and cutting crucial communication nodes. Coordinate with army elements on your flanks. Stick to your training, and we will come out of this unscathed.\n\nAnd now, brothers! To arms! For a better tomorrow! For the glory of our Dąbrowian homeland!"

DGR_nationalise_brembo_desc: "I hoped that we would transform the Brembo plant into a factory for military vehicle parts. So far, all I've gotten is the nationalization of the plant and very long internal fights over who will be on the new management board. There's no talk of transforming the production line until the old-timers divide the positions among themselves. This factory produced braking systems before the war, and all I can get are tons of brake discs and pads. I don't know if this is ironic, as no one slows down investments as much as party members. In the long run, at least the plant will be useful, once it starts operating."
DGR_connect_unused_railways_desc: "Many railway lines, both passenger and freight, in the city have fallen into disrepair. Yet, we have one of the most extensive freight rail networks in the country. The trains were crucial during the city's cleansing operations. We need to rebuild the damaged tracks and create a network of railway connections around the city. This will allow us to move equipment quickly to any front line. Perhaps we could also build a few armored trains?"
DGR_logistical_behemoth_desc: "The Sławków Euroterminal is one of the most important transshipment points in this part of Europe. It is located near the intersection of two Pan-European Transport Corridors and is connected to the major industrial plants in our city. Logistics will be crucial in the current wars. Warlords send their soldiers on deadly marches without support, proper supplies, or transportation. They might afford such idiotic tactics of wasting their people, but we cannot. Trucks, trains, cargo terminals, supply hubs-these are the foundations of a healthy army. One that every soldier will want to serve in."
DGR_commandeer_museum_vehicles_desc: "Lord giveth, and Lord taketh away. Yes, it's true. We stole vehicles from the museum to stage a coup against Bazylak. But they should have been guarded! The vehicles were returned to their original place after we abandoned them. Fortunately, no one else knew how to operate them, so they sat in front of the city hall for several months. But why shouldn't we use them? They are still operational machines, rearming them won't take long, and they are more useful now than ever. Besides, I got used to these steel beasts in those few hours. We're taking everything we can from Sztygarka."
DGR_secret_files_of_bankhutte_desc: "I can't believe my eyes. What started as a wild idea in my head has come true! My people combed through every archival document from the Bank Steelworks... sorry, Dzierżyński Steelworks. What they found there... wow. I don't know how it survived the years of communization, decommunization, and recommunization, but we found technical documents on tanks built here during World War II. Germans assembled Panthers and Tigers here! Unfortunately, there are no documents for V1 and V2 rockets. A pity. But still, if everything goes according to plan, we will be able to produce our own Panzerkampfwagen. Of course, rechristened in a communist style, with improved mechanisms and more modern weaponry. Just imagine the looks on our enemies' faces!"
DGR_first_mixed_brigade_desc: "An army doesn't live by infantry alone. To break through to the northern borders of Jura and Dąbrowian Basin, we will need maneuverability and vehicles capable of traversing difficult terrain. Yes, I am thinking ahead, but only this way will we be prepared for anything. We need a proper armored brigade. Okay, maybe we can't field a true one. But if we gather all our junk vehicles, detach them from infantry support, add newly produced vehicles, and combine them into a single armored fist, then we'll have at least some element of strength. It's more than what others have. And it will be a significant advantage."
DGR_restore_jw_sulno_desc: "During the communist era, there was a military unit in Sulno. Initially, it served as housing for workers involved in building the nearby micro-steelworks. Now, it's the perfect place to re-establish a military unit, given its proximity to Sosnowiec. Besides, we need to accommodate our growing number of soldiers somewhere. They can't keep sleeping in a hotel; it's absurd from a security standpoint. And they shouldn't have it too easy-after all, this is the army, not an all-inclusive vacation."
DGR_fortify_slawkow_desc: "Sławków is highly exposed to attacks from both Sosnowiec and Jaworzno. Since it's our key logistical hub, we can't leave it vulnerable. Therefore, it's essential to fortify the Euroterminal and all exposed railway lines. The damn forest doesn't make our job any easier, and enemy bands are just waiting for a moment of weakness to strike our critical points. We'll have to assign people to guard posts, as if I didn't already have enough problems with manpower."
DGR_turn_mydlice_into_fortress_desc: "Since the Battle of Stalingrad, the world has witnessed the horrors of urban warfare. Today, each of the massive communist apartment blocks stands as a fortress, perfectly suited for defense. Why bother with bunkers when a concrete jungle serves the same purpose at a lower cost? A bit of reinforced concrete makes the enemy think twice before entering a trap where every window could be a hail of bullets and projectiles. The sheer size of these skyscrapers also means nothing escapes our notice. And even if they manage to reach one building, they'll have to clear it floor by floor, apartment by apartment, room by room. The cost of capturing such a stronghold is simply prohibitive."
DGR_officers_in_gangs_desc: "We may have rushed too much in parting ways with the cannon fodder that the gangs represented. We'll need to make amends with them now that the time of trial has come, and wartime effort is required from everyone. However, there's no way we're just going to hand them weapons and let them run wild. Each gang unit will be assigned one of our officers. This way, we'll ensure control at every level and reduce the chances of rebellion or insubordination."
DGR_political_commissars_desc: "Swish, swoosh and bang - my dreams have gone up in smoke. I was hoping for officers who would answer to my authority, not ideological commissars who will dutifully report every minor infraction to the party leadership. I suppose I'd probably do the same in their position. But that's fine. Indoctrination and complete brainwashing take a long time, which makes such commissars quite valuable. Besides, our gang members aren't exactly skilled with grenades... accidents are bound to happen."
DGR_partisan_blitzkrieg_desc: "The vast expanse of our city allows for wide-front maneuver warfare to unfold here. However, the abundance of forests, lakes, apartment blocks, and overall biome diversity means we can primarily engage in guerilla warfare. Defending our territory isn't as daunting when every nook and cranny can serve as a hideout for partisans. Local knowledge will definitely tip the scales in our favor; even the smallest park will become a Vietnam or Afghanistan for any invaders."
DGR_revenge_at_czarzasty_desc: "Włodzimierz Czarzasty. The most reviled figure by anyone under 60. Unless, of course, you're 140 years old and a communist like Comrade Szwej. Czarzasty has always seen Zagłębie as his stronghold of support. But for what he's done to the left... the right will congratulate him, while leftists will want his blood. His traditionalist views are unchangeable, and his contemptuous attitude towards everyone else in the now thankfully defunct Intercounty has become legendary. Now we'll repay him in kind. As another leftist leader once said, a man is judged by how he finishes. And Czarzasty will end badly."
DGR_strike_back_at_antifa_desc: "Even more than the contemptible duo from Sosnowiec, I detest the rabble from Jaworzno. The anarcho-communists from Antifa have no respect for anyone. Whether it's Ziobro's puppets, us, or the Silesians, they'll rob, attack, and call everyone fascists. I've had enough of these 'border incidents' where gangs turn our border into their personal squat. We need to strike back, and we need to strike hard, so they won't even have a chance to lift their drug-fueled heads in response. The black terror of Antifa ends today!"
DGR_annexation_of_zagorze_desc: "Zagórze. Once a separate city, later annexed by Sosnowiec, and closely tied to Dąbrowa Górnicza. Let's be honest - most of the population lived there just to commute to work in the Dąbrowa steel mills. So why create unnecessary problems by maintaining a boundary between these two urban centers? We should simply annex Zagórze as a rightful district of Dąbrowa Górnicza. It always should have been that way. At least the boundaries will be neater and more logical."
DGR_railway_siewierz_zabkowice_desc: "We urgently need a railway connection running from our industrial centers to Pyrzowice Airport. Currently, the route goes through Zawiercie, but there's no need to detour there when we can run the railway straight through Siewierz and Mierzęcice. The airport will serve as our gateway to the world, and we plan to start moving a significant amount of goods through it-both for export and import. Until we can repair the roads, investing in trains will be more practical and cost-effective."
DGR_connect_lagisza_desc: "Będzin industry is going through very difficult times. The cement plant in Grodziec, the Będzin steelworks, the Grodziec coal mine, the shoe factory - none of these establishments exist anymore. The power plant in Łagisza itself operates at only about 20% of its nominal capacity. This is what capitalist rule has led to. A key branch of the economy has become a mere shadow of its former self - from the power plant, through the mines, and ending with the steelworks.\nWe must restore the proper strength of Będzin's industry by integrating it into our great industrial complex. By giving the first impulse ourselves, we will reactivate, step by step, all the closed plants, and it will be a fantastic investment in the future. And we will start with the steelworks."
DGR_question_of_leadership_desc: "The self-proclaimed capital of the Basin has fallen. How dared they call themselves the capital when the name itself is DĄBROWA BASIN, not SOSNOWIEC? But putting etymology aside, it must be acknowledged that Czarzasty built strong party structures here, something he failed to achieve across the country for so many years. Although everyone was ostensibly our opponent, and it's clear that many won't want to radicalize to fit our views, perhaps we can persuade some that our path is the right one. The question remains, though, whether we even want such people."
DGR_evict_squatters_desc: "Indeed, as much as one might criticize capitalist economies, the phenomenon of squatting is simply abhorrent. No matter who you are, how much you earn, or what you present, if bands of Antifa come knocking at your door, you can be sure that your property will turn into a haven for the worst kind of leftist degeneration. This has happened to a large number of apartments in Jaworzno - black squads had to find somewhere to settle, so they just kicked out random people - regardless of whether they were leftist or rightist, old or young, wealthy or poor. It was indiscriminate, treating everyone the same. But now, the time for justice has come. No squat will remain standing."
DGR_railway_around_myslowice_desc: "In Szczakowa, a northern district of Jaworzno, there is a large railway station connecting multiple lines. We need access to this station - a railway gateway that will open the way to the Silesian metropolis but won't lead to Katowice. It might also be wise to avoid Mysłowice, given the recent chaos with partisans and saboteurs. However, if we establish a new line from Euroterminal through Jaworzno and Imielin, we will create an easy route for encircling the metropolis and facilitating trade with Podbeskidzie and southern Małopolska."
DGR_connect_jaworzno_desc: "Fortunately for Jaworzno, true masters of industry have returned and are taking the helm. The Jaworzno Power Plant complex, combined with the rest of our energy network, will practically ensure independence from imports throughout the entire region. Meanwhile, Jaworzno's completely demolished industry will have to be thoroughly rebuilt. Recreational areas? Who needs them when people are starving!\nFirst, we will focus on rebuilding the glassworks in Szczakowa. After that, we will restore other elements of the city's industrial might that have been forgotten by previous governments."
DGR_question_of_councils_desc: "I wonder how anarchists ever achieved anything. Their communes are nothing more than another form of corrupt democracy. Adding to that, each operated for its own benefit, which makes it more accurate to call it not anarcho-communism but a rather strange form of anarcho-capitalism. Minister Gdula is the perfect example of this - he's a true hero of the real estate market! How can people like him even pretend to represent socialist ideals? At least I'm upfront about not having such ideals. Well, maybe sometimes I do."
DGR_reclaim_greater_zaglebie_desc: "Dąbrowa Basin isn't just Dąbrowa Górnicza, Sosnowiec, and Będzin. In fact, Jaworzno barely qualifies for that part. But the Basin also includes Olkusz, Zawiercie, and Myszków. At this rate, we might as well pull Częstochowa in too, so it doesn't feel left out in all of this. The situation is clear - we're now too far along to stop at just a few neighboring cities. I think I understand how Trotsky felt with his permanent revolution..."
DGR_red_star_over_jasna_gora_desc: "Jasna Góra. A symbol of Polish Catholicism. The Church has always had a somewhat ambivalent relationship with communism. Yes, it's known - Cardinal Wyszyński, Father Popiełuszko, and John Paul II destroyed little communists. But when we stand with the people, we cannot reject the Christian spirit in favor of some atheistic notions of young leftists. Belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster won't heal a divided nation. And please, let's keep the priests away from young boys. We don't want a repeat of our parish issues..."
DGR_adjust_jura_factories_desc: "Myszków and Zawiercie have long been tied to heavy industry in their regions. Additionally, the Światowit plant used to produce Frania washing machines! Who wouldn't want such a marvel now, especially when there will be a perfect demand for them? But beyond washing machines, the metallurgical plants in the Jura region will fit seamlessly into our economic framework. We need to strike while the iron is hot, so we should immediately start restructuring these plants and shifting production to meet our growing needs. Primarily, for the war effort..."
DGR_play_like_its_82_desc: "They want to play? Let them have it. They shouldn't forget under whose rule the Polish national team achieved its greatest successes. I know it's the twilight of their era, it's martial law times. But still, it says a lot about our sporting society. And since then? A quarter-final at Euro 2016 and defeats to powerhouses like Moldova, Kazakhstan, and the Faroe Islands. Coach Brzęczek might have the right ideas, but he lacks a solid state apparatus and a big, fucking army. And that's what we have. You can't build an army based on hooligans. Oh, wait. We kinda did."
DGR_death_forests_of_lubliniec_desc: "Lubliniec was supposed to be a walk in the park; the area isn't heavily urbanized or situated at particularly strategic points. Yet, fighting on these cursed fields is far from pleasant, and engaging with commandos is not easy, even, or perhaps especially, after their surrender. Especially considering they have access to fucking huge forests where they hide like cursed soldiers. How are we going to flush them out from there?"
DGR_imagine_shrooms_desc: "I sent my people to the slaughter. I don't even want to think about how many senseless deaths occurred in those cursed forests. Even setting them on fire didn't help. On the contrary, I'm sure that the fire has added dozens of soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorders to our losses. From Woźniki to Pawonki, the dead are piling up, and the devastation will remind us for weeks that we made a colossal mistake. And we still have to extinguish the fires and gather the bodies before they turn the soil into fertile ground for fungi."
DGR_offer_for_supreme_coach_desc: "Mr. Brzęczek, I respect you. You're an ideologically driven man - ambitious and with an extraordinary zeal for achieving your goals. Unfortunately, on the wrong side of the barricade. But don't worry, all Poles are one family, and the ideology of Marxism-Clubbism is so hysterically absurd that I can't help but respect the serious way you pursue such nonsense. Indeed, it's a better idea than most leftist movements. I'm not saying I'd be eager to implement it, but our cause needs people like you. Personally, I'd even be willing to persuade you to our side, offering amnesty for your closest collaborators and autonomy for the clubs. And if not, there's always room for a new coach at Tęcza Błędów..."
DGR_question_of_church_desc: "Częstochowa, as Poland's religious capital, has quite a socialist streak. After all, since 2010, it has been governed by a leftist president - one of the few who has managed to hold on in the country. Just like in Dąbrowa. Perhaps we could extract what's needed from this religious mix and create something interesting? For example, a nationalism rooted in Polish Catholic traditions combined with the socialist traits attributed to Jesus in the Bible. After all, he was considered one of the greatest socialists, as the classic saying goes. It seems to me that Comrade Konieczny (the one from the PPS, not the Antifa thug) was right in trying to create a popular religious organization here. We should seriously discuss this with him."
DGR_great_combine_desc: "What's better than one steel mill? Multiple steel mills working towards the same goal. Why waste time and money managing several separate plants when you can consolidate them into a massive central metallurgical complex that can handle any order in no time? Compatibility and interchangeability between specific units will be far more cost-effective than dividing them into separate entities. Or maybe I just know fuck all about economics and am spouting bullshit. Ah, but that would still make me more competent than our Minister of Economy."
DGR_avanti_popolo_desc: "The National People's Army has triumphed! From Częstochowa to Jaworzno, people can rejoice because we've reached the historic moment when, after many years, we are finally the masters of our own cities. The entire region deserves this tremendous revolutionary surge - we are the industrial heart of Poland, while Silesia is a shitty old pigsty. We carry the spark of pioneers who will renew this country! Each of us heralds greatness, justice, and equality. And rest assured - we will bring this torch of popular freedom to the rest of the country. Sooner or later."

DGR_we_forge_our_tomorrow_desc: "Sometimes I wonder if what I'm doing has any real significance. I'm just a tool of fate, one that can be discarded once the job is done. No matter what path I choose, in the end, it turns out that I'm not the one making the choices. The game was rigged from the start. Nationalism, communism, paganism - none of it matters. All that matters is playing your role well. Maybe then an opportunity will arise to change the status quo of reality. But for now, glory to the working people of cities and countryside, I guess... We're forging a new, national-popular future. How many more slogans will we churn out before they lose their meaning?"
DGR_unity_congress_desc: "The Party is calling. I'd pity myself if I had access to this Congress of the Working Class, but unfortunately, military personnel aren't welcome. I could argue that we work the hardest so that the apparatchiks can rot in their offices, enjoying freedom and life. But they can even have a damn UN summit if they want. The National People's Army now has enough influence in the country that it doesn't matter what decisions the comrades make."
DGR_civilian_rule_under_army_desc: "The party members deliberate, while the army decides. As Comrade Wiesław used to say, \"Power once seized will never be relinquished.\" And we certainly do not intend to give up our privileged position over the civilian authorities. We are the sole guarantors of our state's existence, and under the military banner, the national-popular future will flourish! It wasn't the bureaucrats who defended Sławków from the Antifa black gangs, nor did they defeat the enemies of communism in the Dąbrowa Basin, nor did they capture Jasna Góra. It was the army. And the army... is ours. Well, to be honest... it's MINE."
DGR_recommunization_desc: "There are, however, some things I have no control over, no matter how hard I try. But then again, it's not surprising. Nationalist rhetoric and symbolism are already well established in Poland. It's the communist one that needs to be revived and dug out of the infernal abyss. Only then will the idea of national communism be achieved when both elements mix and balance each other. As long as neither idea oversteps its bounds. Well, unless it's us. We can."
DGR_symbolism_act_desc: "In Poland, the hammer and sickle have always been regarded with the same revulsion as the swastika. Not much will change in that regard, so it's best to leave their use in the past. If we want to be taken seriously as a movement and not be lumped together with Stalin and Bierut, we need to promote our own symbols. The red lightning bolt and the red hammer - what could be more subtle and powerful than combining these two elements? After all, the hammer will forge the iron sword with which we will defeat all our enemies as fast as lightning."
DGR_authority_dilemma_desc: "Joseph Stalin did nothing wrong. Che Guevara was a revolutionary hero. Such statements often circulate within the left. But just as the right venerates murderers, the left also has a tendency to place truly unsavory figures on a pedestal. We must be different. I won't allow anyone in our circles to use authorities that are absurd to Poles. And perhaps, in the end, we might even reject Marx as the spiritual progenitor of all communism. After all, Hegelian ideas might suit us better than the ramblings of a privileged Jew who never worked a day in his life."
DGR_private_enterprises_desc: "The cult of entrepreneurs has reached its peak in our late capitalism. The exploitation of ordinary people by pathological liars who consider themselves the backbone of the Polish economy has been staggering. People were forced to live in a free market that guaranteed them nothing, primarily not even survival until the next day. Corporations, private profiteers, fraudsters, and thieves - each of them will face the hand of justice. And that hand wields a sword with which we will give every exploiter what they deserve. Under this communist postulate... I will sign with both hands"
DGR_fallen_monuments_desc: "It's somewhat amusing how certain public institutions in the Dąbrowa Basin suddenly came into possession of long-lost communist monuments following the announcement to restore them. It turns out that decommunization didn't mean destroying symbols or severing ties with the past; it was merely a \"hide it for later, it might come in handy\" operation. And now, it indeed comes in handy. How on earth did they know?"
DGR_living_factory_desc: "A workplace is like a second home. While that doesn't mean you should actually spend the night there, it does imply that major facilities should offer the right kind of amenities. Modern corporations boast about their game rooms, book nooks, and foosball tables. That's great, but we should go further. Our workplaces should feature restaurants, bars, and various public establishments. This not only fills our coffers but also boosts morale significantly. Let the revitalized Defum plant in Dąbrowa Górnicza, now known as The Living Factory, be the prime example. We've refurbished the factory, but the local pubs and eateries remain, serving the workers after, of course, and not during working hours."
DGR_security_service_desc: "I always wanted to have my own security forces. But it seems that this idea will be turned against me. Comrades from the government are working hard to minimize the influence of the army and to have any form of defense against potential internal threats. So maybe it's time to hurry up? Maybe this is a sign from fate? Otherwise, it might soon turn out that all the top officers will either face trials or, at worst, just disappear"
DGR_government_reconstruction_desc: "About time. I've long maintained that this grotesque caricature mistakenly called the People's Front is fit only for the dustbin of history. The chief relic of the Dąbrowa communist era has decreed that the government will undergo a radical overhaul, and that the newly appointed officials will be more in line with the ideals of our state. It's rather amusing how deeply he has insulted his current ministers in the process. If I were in their position, I would take this to heart and flee while there's still a chance to do so on my own terms. But it's not about me, is it?"
DGR_silesian_faction_desc: "I understand that Szwej feels isolated, but forming some kind of group of communist super comrades is senseless. We would only create a criminal regime preoccupied with internal power struggles rather than fighting external enemies. We do not need more communists, especially those unsure whether they want to praise Gierek or Gomułka. Some have even ventured far beyond our eastern border and prefer Mao Zedong. Deng Xiaoping might be tolerable, but Maoists? Next thing I know, we'll be recruiting Pol Pot enthusiasts or adherents of Juche..."
DGR_cult_of_gierek_desc: "If there is someone in the Dąbrowa Basin who could be equated with John Paul II in terms of mythologization and cult, it is undoubtedly comrade Edward Gierek, the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party in the 1970s. He was originally from Sosnowiec, which is already a plus for him. But just ask someone who had the chance to live during those times, and they will tell you that comrade Gierek built the power of the Basin. Thanks to him, Dąbrowa Górnicza developed unimaginably. In 1970, the city's population was 60,000. By the end of his rule, it had already reached 140,000, more than double! His investments laid the foundations for this magnificent city, tamed the industrial potential of the Dąbrowa Basin, and exploited it to the fullest. And for that, people still love him. Because after him... things only got worse."
DGR_partisans_faction_desc: "As a former partisan, I firmly say that we should pursue this path. The path of nationalist-populism. We don't need more communists - what we need is a strong nationalist faction capable of uniting people from various backgrounds under the banner of nationalist rhetoric. That way, it won't matter whether someone follows Stalin or Dmowski; they will be able to integrate into our structures. And, I won't hide it - more allies for me in the Politburo."
DGR_civilian_apparatus_desc: "And as I expected, the Gierek faction is raising their voice, claiming that the army has too many powers, and its freedoms and influence must be radically cut. What the fuck. Clip our wings and then wonder why we're not flying. So far, all they've managed to do is expand the civilian administration and start a civil-military conflict. However, the further we go, the worse it will get. This won't end well - they won't stop, and we won't go down easily. War is coming."
DGR_wide_socialist_front_desc: "I retract what I said about Pol Potists and Jucheists. Because that's indeed the direction we're heading. Fortunately, there don't seem to be any Posadists yet. But knowing the realities of the Politburo, it's only a matter of time. Szwej already has ideas from outer space, so what would it be for him to proclaim a communist revolution brought by aliens? I just want to remind everyone - there was already one such attempt to create a great socialist front. In fact, several. In elections, the left always wanted to form grand coalitions to barely make it over the threshold. And the second one was called the Intercounty. We all remember how that ended."
DGR_progress_fund_desc: "I feel like something like this has been done before. Ah, yes, the Economic Progress Fund already existed. In fact, now I see it has the same goals - funding for farmers who suffered during the wars. Of course, aid will be granted only if they prepare the land for collectivization or fall under the protection of state agricultural enterprises. Clever move, Minister. We all know that farmers won't refuse such hefty subsidies. Just hope this fund lasts longer than its predecessor did, which was barely two years."
DGR_national_socialism_desc: "We have a strong socialist political front. We have nationalist elements in the army. So... I don't want to be the one explaining basic math here, but wouldn't this work out to be something like... National Socialism? Maybe use Socialist Nationalism, it might go down easier. You could have had a true nationalist-populist revolution, but instead, you'll end up with a strange amalgam of popular ideologies seasoned with an antagonistic military. The Soviet Union would be proud. The Third Reich, not so much, despite the name."
DGR_cult_of_moczar_desc: "The legacy of the factional wars in the PRL still affects our society, especially now. On one side, the socialists adhering to Gierek, on the other, we, the nationalist-populist patriots who now need a symbol as strong as the first secretary from Sosnowiec. And there is no better choice than Mieczysław Moczar, who embodied the idea of national-communism and right-wing nationalist tendencies. He will be the figure whose spirit will unite our political environment under one ideology. Let us just cool down with the antisemitic remarks for now."
DGR_military_government_desc: "If comrade Szwej's problem is that the military has far more influence on reality than the government, I have a solution for him. Simply integrate military personnel into the government. Isn't that simple? No more passively accepting idiotic political regulations from above. The National People's Army must become the official executive branch of our country because only this way can true revolution be realized. We will end all internal conflicts within the government and among politicians once and for all. They could use some real military discipline. If we shout loud enough... they'll agree to anything."
DGR_ideological_purity_desc: "Too much of anything is unhealthy. Ideological fragmentation does not serve the unity and strength of our state. We've seen this before with the unified front in the Basin; sooner or later, the leftists will turn on each other, and nothing will stop them from tearing apart even the greatest power. I believe we are ready for phase two. For what I have been building here since I decided that betraying my ideals and joining the Popular Front would be an investment in the future. And the future is now, old man. We stand on the brink of a glorious creation, a glorious revolution which will see this country reborn."
DGR_army_lobbying_desc: "The situation is very simple. We don't enter the government to avoid benefiting from it. And since every gain we make is an investment in the safety of our nation, that's a secondary matter, but a good one that arises from this entire cycle. We won't have to constantly beg the Politburo or threaten them with rebellion to get something. Now, we'll simply take what is rightfully ours, and no ministerial complaints will be able to stop us. We will strengthen the army to the point where all my dreams can be realized. And they are grand ones."
DGR_national_bolshevism_desc: "A time comes in the history of humanity when extraordinary individuals stand at a crossroads and are forced to make difficult choices that will determine the future of many. The National People's Army is ready. Our people within government institutions are also ready. The Palace of Culture will be surrounded. Comrade Szwej will undergo a long, enforced conversation with me. We will clarify a few things, and this time, it won't end as it did before. Lessons were learned here. And let hell consume me if we fail now. The plan has been years in the making; I was born for this moment. The previous failure was merely an element designed to prepare me for today. National Bolshevism, or death."
DGR_5_year_plan_desc: "Economic plans are cool. Instead of chaotic investments in whatever the global economy throws at us and all those theories about supply and demand, we're executing our objectives step by step. The capitalists are furious because, of course, you can't arbitrarily decide in which year to build which sectors of the economy, you have to think about Hayek. I couldn't fucking care less about the Austrians and their damned economic school; nothing enslaves people like capitalism. We know what people need, and we will steer to complete the seventh Five-Year Plan in Polish history. The seventh. The six previous ones clearly showed that the results are positive."
DGR_heavy_industry_nationalisation_desc: "Heavy industry is the backbone of the nation. The prosperity of the state depends on its proper functioning; the entire national economy relies on it. Therefore, we cannot allow a private entity to dictate terms to the state by controlling a key sector of the economy. No. All strategic economic positions and heavy industries must be state-owned to ensure that they work for the nation, rather than enriching some private individual at the expense of the country's future. Only nationalized enterprises will be cared for by their administrators as if they were their most cherished family."
DGR_restore_defunct_plants_desc: "The Balcerowicz Plan and its consequences have been a disaster for the Polish nation. The economy was completely devastated, enterprises went bankrupt in large numbers, and vast swathes of people were left without jobs or prospects for the future. The way in which liberal governments over the following decades attempted to eradicate any signs of Polish economic spirit deserves a separate category of national treason. Entire sectors - mining, metallurgy, shipbuilding, automotive industry - collapsed, yet those responsible for this never faced any consequences. Now they will. We shall, step by step, restore all the fallen enterprises to life. For the people. By the people."
DGR_prefab_apartments_desc: "Liberal governments loved to boast about the number of apartments they built and the wonderful lodgings they created. They were completely indifferent to the fact that ordinary people couldn't afford to live in their magnificent villas. After all, some wealthy investor would eventually come along and invest in real estate. A young person stands no chance of owning their own apartment; if they're lucky, they might afford to rent a tiny room in a six-person house within a cramped block. We need a mass housing program. A mass one, not just three hundred small units once every ten years."
DGR_real_estate_crash_desc: "I don't know if there's a worse creature than a landlord. In our state, the real estate market has essentially collapsed. Total breakdown, thanks to our efforts. And that's a good situation. On the ruins of this sick system, we can build a new world where there's no need to rely on the benevolence of real estate agents who might graciously lower the rent by 2 zlotys per square meter, while increasing utility fees by several hundred zlotys. Enough of flippers, enough of exploitation. Housing is a human right, not a commodity! And for those who so eagerly played with people's lives and mocked this fundamental right, we have special housing. Nice ones, where they'll never have to move out for the rest of their lives."
DGR_pgr_desc: "Farmers have become quite spoiled since the fall of communism. They've absorbed capitalist ideology to the core, which, combined with their socialist roots and demands, has created a terrifying mix. Entitlement, a lack of communal spirit, and no sense of responsibility towards society. The National Agricultural Farms we're introducing today will bring them back to reality and cement the image of the farmer as one who cares for the national community by feeding the entire country, not just themselves. And this is just the beginning of the changes they will face."
DGR_collectivisation_desc: "Privatization of agricultural land was a disastrous move towards liberalism. The conflicts surrounding this event persist to this day, and some farmers simply have no clue about management and shouldn't be involved at all. Therefore, collectivization will help achieve excellent results. Those who can work will work. Those who can manage will manage. Everyone in their place, everyone working hard for the common good. We will start with agriculture. Eventually, we will achieve a true national community where the fruits of labor will serve everyone who is honored to belong to our nation."
DGR_wait_and_see_desc: "The seed of productivity has been sown. The plans have been outlined, the organizations prepared to begin production according to the appropriate standards and agendas. Programs essential for the functioning of the five-year plan have been launched. Everyone knows what they must do.\nYes, there may be some fluctuations in the markets due to the revolutionary changes we are carrying out here. Surely, things will get worse for a while before they get better. But now, all that remains is to stay the course, do our work, and wait... for the fruits of our labor. And then we will savor their taste without having to tighten our belts any longer. It's almost here. Just five years."
DGR_green_utopia_desc: "Bas Tajpan, who recently decided to engage politically under his real name, presented a package of laws today that are intended as a response to the Green New Deal. To me, it seems like he's trying to be holier than the Pope, scrutinizing all European regulations and tightening the screws twice as hard. Banning car production, banning animal husbandry, dismantling our heavy industry and energy sector. I don't know if this man is joking or if he's a damn saboteur. No one in their right mind would take this seriously. Even Comrade Dementia isn't detached enough from reality to make us all frolic in green meadows like Disney princesses in a few years."
DGR_legalizacja_teraz_legalizacja_tu_desc: "From the start, I knew that dealing with this parasite would bring nothing but trouble! Perhaps if he had stayed sober, he wouldn't have had the energy to spout nonsense about the medicinal properties of drugs. And now Minister Krępa thinks it's the perfect time to give the Politburo an ultimatum - legalization of marijuana. So, all those previous ideas were just a smokescreen for this one issue. What frightens me is how many supporters he seems to have. Am I not the only member of the People's Front who has secretly been building an underground power base, waiting for the right moment?"
DGR_appease_them_desc: "If it shuts his damn mouth, so be it - I might even vote for legalization. Let him get high and keep him away from the Politburo meetings, because, as God is my witness, I'll light up a two-meter joint up his ass if he shows up again. And yes, we've got those in the army. They're called short-range missiles. Still, it seems like an appropriate approach to the current problem. People are shouting for something, demanding something. With legalization, at least we'll have control over the substance and its distribution, and we won't create another black market. We've had enough trouble with that already."
DGR_people_are_pissed_desc: "Okay, it seems like people weren't specifically asking for marijuana legalization... because they're still protesting. Today, strike committees were formed at the Myszków and Zawiercie factories. If it's not about marijuana... then what is it? They have housing - somewhat livable. They receive money - what they can buy with it is not our concern; we're in a civil war. Alcohol and cigarettes aren't taxed by us, so they're even cheaper. Security - provided. What could they possibly be missing?"
DGR_strikes_spreading_desc: "Freedom? What is freedom to a bunch of workers whose life goal is to work 8 hours, go to the pub with his mates, and then return to a wife who's rotting at home with the kids? What deeper needs could they possibly have that make democracy essential for them? None. People are divided into the ruling class and those destined to be ruled. Someone is inciting our workers; they aren't capable of such profound thoughts on their own to realize they are being controlled. We'll send security services to every factory to unmask the agitators. In the meantime, we need to start thinking about prevention because factories in Częstochowa, Sosnowiec, and Lubliniec are now joining the strikes..."
DGR_mistrzostwa_w_palowaniu_gornikow_desc: "Good morning, today we begin the National Championships in Beating Workers. The teams from all units of the National People's Army are ready to start the competition, warming up before the games and eagerly awaiting the first whistle from the officiating officers. Before you, the opening match - the 1st Battalion 'Edmund Cedler' will face off against the striking workers from the Zawiercie Steelworks. Who will win? We can only guess, though the favorite is undoubtedly the Red Banner Battalion. We also invite you to the other matches scheduled for this week at the largest industrial facilities in your city. Guaranteed beatings or deportation to a labor camp."
DGR_czolgi_na_hute_desc: "And you, steelworkers of Dąbrowa, you too? Stabbing us in the back? There will be no bread, because there is none. There is vinegar and steel. There will be no freedom either, because you don't need it. But refusal to work in strategically important factories during martial law will be met with the harshest penalty. The Politburo has agreed to execute the most radical of preventive scenarios. Tanks will once again head towards the Katowice Steelworks. And this time there will be no agreements, no Solidarity, and no Round Table. There will be pain, toil, and gnashing of teeth."
DGR_history_repeating_desc: "We cannot afford to be weak again. History tends to repeat itself, but in this case, it's so we can learn from our mistakes and not repeat them. Making concessions with striking workers is the first and greatest mistake one can make in the face of mass protests. We will respond to any sign of resistance to our authority with an iron fist and fire. As the historical maxim goes: \"Any provocateur or lunatic who dares to raise a hand against the people's authority can be certain that authority will sever that hand.\"\n\nCyrankiewicz was right. Today more than ever."
DGR_komu_to_potrzebne_desc: "Legalize marijuana? Why? Who needs it? We did not fight so hard against the criminal drug underground in Dąbrowa just to allow junkies to corrupt society once again. I will never vote for it. We are trying to build a new community, free from substances and addictions, not to surrender to the weaknesses of the underworld. No one will convince me that this is normal and natural. I have seen enough of the effects of this so-called \"wonder drug,\" which drives young people into debt and leaves their minds foggy as if they were perpetually dazed."
DGR_nowy_protest_desc: "In Zielona Park, government documents related to the criminalization of drugs, including marijuana, were just burned. The event was led by Minister Krępa, also known as Bas Tajpan. Then everyone started singing some nonsensical song about how, if they were a magician with three wishes, they would choose a kilo of marijuana. And then another song that goes like, \"Dąbrowa Górnicza, dressed in prohibition. Killed nobody, but still prohibited\" Yes, we all know those worthless artistic pieces. But for a minister to do something like this is a slap in the face of authority. And for this insult, Bas Tajpan will pay dearly."
DGR_diss_na_rzad_desc: "Minister Damian Krępa is no longer a said minister. Once someone starts opposing their own government while still being part of it, it no longer makes sense. Thus, we facilitated his trip to rock bottom by dismissing him immediately. Loyal government units are already heading towards the capital to crush this rebelling scum into dust. I can't wait for the last subversive element to vanish from our streets. The rest will disperse very quickly, and the situation will be under control.\n\nWait... is that idiot really putting on a concert in front of the palace?"
DGR_criminal_hydra_desc: "It's clear that a significant portion of our soldiers come from ghettos and gangster rap communities. One can leave a criminal environment, but mental poverty remains incurable. And it's within such circles that Bas Tajpan found his support. This concerns me greatly because it means that within the National People's Army, there is a cancer that will be hard to cure. Striking workers are breaking the law, so by definition, they have also become criminals. It will be difficult to manage a nation where the majority stands on the other side of the law.\n\nI'm worried about issuing the order to break through to the capital at all costs through blocked streets. There's a risk that soldiers might refuse to carry out the order. If that happens, it would mean they are criminals too... My head is starting to ache from all this."
DGR_SPALMY_BABILON_desc: "Once again, it seems I underestimated the power of the masses as they are unable to grasp ideas that go beyond the tip of their damn noses and reach further than their next meal. So, I have what I deserve. It's strange that I wasn't shot or burned at the stake on the spot, whatever they might have preferred. Locked in some dark cell, I await my fate. Meanwhile, the infamous \"Babylon\" is burning. Literally, the coup was executed amidst the flames of several fires in the capital. And the striking workers haven't even lifted a finger to help us. So, we face a Rastafarian future."

This is undoubtedly a turning point in the war that has dragged on for many years, ever since Ziobro's hordes invaded the Zagłębie region. Now it is their land, their blood. And we will be the liberators from the chains! It's true that the Prosecutorship's forces have withdrawn from further military operations, and we are not strong enough to continue our offensive - but this is certainly a step closer to Olkusz.

Those lands remain under the boot of tyranny, still ruled by the iron hand of the Supreme Prosecutorship. This defeat marks a bitter blow in the long war that began when Ziobro's hordes first stormed the Zagłębie region. Our men fought bravely, but the enemy's defenses were too strong. For now, the path to Olkusz is closed. And the treacherous, fascist creature remains unpunished."

dgr_district.1.t: "Ride into Obsession"
dgr_district.1.desc: "Marcin Bazylak didn't even look back. The guards had let him go-not out of mercy, but indifference. The coup was over, the National Council had declared victory, and there was no point in holding a broken man. His breath steamed in the morning air as he stumbled to his Skoda Superb, fumbled with the keys, and fired up the engine. He didn't care where he left the documents or if anyone followed him. There was only one thought in his mind: his family. Tires screeched as he turned onto the main road. Is he too late? Past the quiet buildings. Were they telling the truth? Past shuttered shops. Was it just a lie? Through the smoking ruins of last week's 'random' explosions.\n\nAt the roundabout near Katowice Steelworks, he missed the exit. His hands trembled. Sweat poured despite the cold. Somewhere between panic and instinct, he tried to turn back - too sharply, too fast. The car fishtailed. Slammed into a barrier. Metal groaned, glass cracked, and the world spun.\nSilence. Then voices.\nRough hands pulled open the driver's side door. Boots crunched gravel. Someone pulled Bazylak out, dazed and bleeding, onto the cold pavement.\n- Alive - said one of them. - Barely.\nPresident passed out. When he woke up, he was lying on the couch in some old office. Is he in the Steelworks? Standing above him was a broad-shouldered man in an old suit, with a faded red star pinned to the collar. First Secretary of the Communist Party of Poland, Krzysztof Szwej.\n- Marcin - Szwej muttered, amused. - Still running?\nBazylak tried to speak, failed, then nodded. His voice cracked. \n- I need to get my wife. My kids...\n- We'll get them - Szwej said firmly - You have more pressing issues to deal with, President.\n\nBehind the dirty window, one could see that smoke was rising across the city. The National Council had barely lasted the morning. But it was already almost sunset. The neighborhoods turned on them fast - old gang grudges, political feuds, vendettas with boots and fire. The police were gone for good. Bargieła fled west, toward Łęknice with only a handful of his loyal friends. A few minutes later, in a backroom beneath an old steelworks office, Bazylak sat with a wet rag to his head and a cup of bitter coffee in his shaking hands.\n- I can't - he whispered - I'm done. I should've left years ago.\n- You'll do what's needed - Szwej said, pacing across the room - We all will.\nHe turned to one of his men. - Find his family. Bring them here. Safe. Take three men with you. - Then he turned to Bazylak, quieter now - You were a ghost in a dead state, comrade. But now you'll help build something real.\n\nAs the steelworkers were leaving the premises to find the president's family, they saw one of their comrades raising red banners and instead of the text \"Huta Katowice\" above the gate, they proudly displayed a new one, a declaration that said:"

dgr_district.2.t: "District Wars"
dgr_district.2.desc: "Can a so-called government that controls only one district have any legitimacy to govern the entire city? Dąbrowa Górnicza is a highly conflicted place, if not one outright in a state of anarchy. Gangs constantly terrorize people, holding them in an iron grip while fighting among themselves, for control of one or two more already devastated buildings. And when they came for him, Bazylak had no choice. Well, he had a choice, but he probably would have ended up hanging from a lamppost in Haller's Park. So, he decided to make a pact with the devil and establish a government of municipal unity in the most powerful steel combine in all of Poland - Katowice Steelworks. This industrial facility has now become the last bastion of municipal administration, and it has been taken over by the Communist Party of Poland. How desperate must a person be to decide to hand over power to a group of geriatric dinosaurs from a bygone era? Again, Bazylak had no choice.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone agrees with this decision, and in the industrial heart of Dąbrowa Górnicza, the government managed to gather fewer than a thousand supporters. Can such a small number of soldiers subdue a city of over a hundred thousand? They will definitely need help and skillful maneuvering between the gangs. It's time to divide and conquer."

We weren't even particularly eager to move against them - and it's unclear whether they even realize they've surrendered and chosen not to resist the People's Front.n\nOne way or another, Korzeniec and Zielona have returned to central government control, and that's probably where we should leave it.

At present, fighting is limited to isolated pockets of resistance barricaded inside a few remaining buildings. The city administration has returned to its rightful place: the civilian council has resumed operations at the city hall, while the Party has established its headquarters in the Zagłębie Palace of Culture, which is now being rebuilded and refitted to serve our party as a fine base of operations. Street patrols have resumed, and our militia is closely monitoring the neighborhoods that, just days ago, were too dangerous to even step outside.

dgr_district.13.desc: "Strzemieszyce wasn't particularly a great challenge. They've maniacally expected an attack on the Coke Plant, and when that didn't happen, everyone was losing their mind as to why. They even thought we'd surrender, leave, or decide to HELP THEM. The railway station of Dąbrowa Górnicza Towarowa lay below, quiet for now, too quiet. The rebels had made it their own, stacking containers into makeshift barricades, stringing wire between signal posts, pretending that they could outlast a state. The cargo terminal here is a lung of the city. Without it, no fuel runs east, no steel rolls west. The boy-partisans don't grasp the logic of logistics. But we do. That's why we sent them a gift. Through binoculars, I watched the train crawl along the line from Katowice Steelworks. Four flatcars, a fuel cistern, and an old brown engine. All authentic. The men hidden in the engine and disguised as railwaymen had not spoken since the plan was set. Not out of fear - discipline. They let it in. Just as I predicted, the rebels were desperate for resources and arrogant enough to believe we wouldn't dare move on the yard. The engine rolled past the main switch. I could see one of them wave.\n\nI clicked the radio once.\n\nAt once, the flatcars dropped their sides and unfolded like claws. Militia sprang from compartments, already firing. The train ground to a halt inside the yard, disgorging twenty men into the stunned defenders. Simultaneously, our mortars hidden in the slag fields to the west opened fire. I had calculated the coordinates myself. The barrage cut off escape through the sidings. The rebels panicked. Their fire was wild. A fuel drum caught in the crossfire. Flames rolled through the eastern storage shed. One of their trucks tried to ram the train and was reduced to blackened wreckage before it crossed the yard.\n\nWithin six minutes, the flag was raised over the station's signal tower. Red and unburned. I did not smile. I only marked the time."

dgr_district.14.desc: "From the ridge above the Sławków freight corridor, I watched the sun glint off the steel veins of the Euroterminal. It shimmered - cold and clinical. The rebels had taken it weeks ago and turned it into their little customs kingdom, stockpiling containers of copper, spare electronics, even canned goods from God knows where. But Sławków is already ours. This is only the last place of defiance. They thought they were merchants now. Little loot goblins, lords of rust. But there is no room for lords in the Popular Front.\n\nOur train approached the gate slowly - just as planned. To the defenders, it was nothing but another civilian freight run, a battered locomotive towing six flatcars. No guns visible. No escort. No resistance. I had given the order that morning. No rebels left alive. No warnings. No negotiations. This is not a war for hearts, but for critical infrastructure. And also, those separatists deserve worse. The rebels gathered on the gantry crane, gesturing lazily, rifles slung over their backs. That moment - that fatal moment of confidence - is when we opened the coffin.\n\nThe flatcars split open like blistered skin, and the kamikaze drones emerged like hornets. Simple, cheap, made from agricultural sprayers and soldered rotors. But they were loaded with makeshift explosives and vengeance. I watched through my scope as the swarm arced into the sky, then dived. One, two, five - dozens. Explosions rippled across the gantry. Steel screamed. Rebels fled like rats through container corridors. One drone plunged directly into the customs office. Another sliced through the cab of a pickup as it reversed toward the north gate.\n\nThen came the men. Two dozen storm troops leapt from the cars and advanced under cover of the chaos. Shouting like a band of soviet shock troops from WW2. No mercy. One squad secured the warehouse, another the tracks. By the time the flames licked the southern fencing, the terminal was ours.\n\nProgress, finally."

dgr_district.15.desc: "We came into Łosień with twenty men, expecting scattered resistance. Instead, the squad got split during a firefight near the old reservoir. The unfinished one - dry, overgrown, a concrete crater swallowed by brambles and rusted scaffolding. I slipped trying to flank, rolled into the basin, and when I got up, I was alone.\n\nWell, not quite alone. Something was moving in there with me. I heard it first - soft footfalls on gravel, then silence. A shadow shifting behind rebar. Not a conscript. Not one of those drugged-up street rebels. This one was careful. Patient. I caught a glimpse once - painted face, light gear, rifle with a hunting scope. Professional. A hunter.\n\nAnd apparently, I was the game. I crouched, trying to calm my breath, scanning every broken pipe, every thicket of nettles. My rifle felt heavier by the second. Every twig snap made me flinch. He was circling me. I knew it. I could almost feel his eyes on the back of my neck. Then I saw it - movement, thirty meters ahead. I raised my weapon, finger tightening.\n\nAnd then came the snort. A wild boar. Big. Ugly. It burst from the undergrowth to my right, just as the shot cracked from the trees. Not aimed at me. The hunter fired at the boar. Instinct or panic, I'll never know. I leapt up, swung my rifle toward the muzzle flash and fired. Once. Twice. The second shot hit. A dull thump. A body fell from the perch above, crashing through brittle branches and landing hard in the dust below.\n\nI didn't move at first. I waited, gun shaking in my hands. The boar was gone. The hunter wasn't moving. I approached. He was older. Calm face. Almost serene. I took his rifle, then turned away, heart pounding."

dgr_district.16.desc: "Aleksander Bargieła stood in the darkest corner of the Ząbkowice House of Culture, unseen by those around him - like a predator stalking prey. But there was no prey left. The anarchists had either been wiped out or had surrendered and been carted off to Huta Katowice for a round of mandatory reeducation. At this point, even the word ideology was being bent so far out of shape it would put the traffic roundabout in Będzin to shame. Here he was - a nationalist at heart - leading a platoon of like-minded youths, some more ideologically committed than others, capturing the anarchist stronghold in Ząbkowice side by side with hardened, socialist workers of the People's Front.\n\nEven the best mathematician wouldn't be able to find a common denominator in this mess. But a deal is a deal. As he watched Front troops looting what little there was left in the Big Squat, Aleksander wondered if he and his men would become the next targets of this cold-blooded, pragmatic alliance. He had already ordered his boys west, to secure the Young Steelworkers housing estate. If the communists turned on them, at least they'd have defensible ground.\n\nWatching the bustle, his eyes fell on two young people's commissars inspecting one of the rooms - faces twisted in disgust. It was likely used for hedonistic orgies, drunken benders... or both. Aleksander smirked. So pious, like they'd just walked out of church. So young, like they'd just left school. And already serving the regime so loyally. Just like him now. And who was he, then, to moralize? A sellout, a traitor, the butcher of a red regime. Where does pragmatism end?\n\nBargieła snapped out of it. Doubts were useless now. There was a path ahead - and he had to walk it. Even if it led through a purgatory of sacrifice and contradiction."

Tiles cracked, bullet holes in the walls, and dried blood still staining the corners no one thinks to clean. But I do. I always did. This used to be a good block, full of decent people. Everyone always used to say \"Good Morning\" to me. Old Mr. Łuczak lived on the third floor - retired miner, always had mints for the kids. He died in the first blackout. His heart gave out. No elevator. I found him slumped on the stairs, like he just sat down for a rest.\n\nFourth floor - Kasia and Tomek. Young couple with two daughters. The girls drew chalk suns on the walls. I never had the heart to scrub them off. The last time I saw them, Kasia had a knife tucked into her belt and eyes like stone. They disappeared in the first turf war when the Broadway gangs tried to claim Manhattan. Never found the bodies. Sixth floor - occupied now by a Popular Front field office. But before, it was squatters. I remember a boy there, no older than sixteen, with shaking hands and a makeshift rifle. He called me \"grandma\", even though I'm no one's. He bled out in the stairwell after the reconquest. Tried to hold them off. For what, I don't know.\n\nThe Popular Front soldiers nod to me now. They don't see the ghosts. They think they've reclaimed the block. But the walls remember. I hear them creak at night, like they're still settling into the silence after screams. I mop and scrub. I keep the lights working on the corridors. I chase away the rats. Because someone has to remember.\n\nSomeone has to clean the blood that nobody else wants to see."

My parents and my little brother still live there. I know these streets like I know myself - every pothole, every old street lamp, every crumbling bench. This was my home. Adamiecki Neighborhood. Haller's Park. The park where my parents would go every Sunday for a walk. I saw the tree that my girlfriend and I carved our initials into. \"M+P, 2012\". It's still there, barely visible from under ash and soot. We moved past the old playground - swings rusted, trees half-burned from the firebombings. I used to race my brother there after school. He was always faster. I broke from the squad when I saw the block. Building 6, middle staircase, the one before the small pine tree. Home. I ran ahead, heart hammering. Third floor. Apartment 91. I still remember the code to the door. Inside, it smelled like mold, dust, and something worse.\n\nThey were there.\nDad in the living room.. Mom in the kitchen. And Maciek... my little brother...\nThey were all there, as always.\nDead.\n\nI fell to my knees. I don't know how long I stayed there. Someone called for me on the radio. I didn't answer. I thought that I should cry. I couldn't. There were supposed to be feelings, questions, bargaining, despair. Any stage of grief. §tANYTHING.§!\nNothing. After what I thought was eternity, I pulled myself out of the apartment. Down there, I saw our platoon with some prisoners. Gangsters. One of them I knew. We went to school together. Krystian. He saw me and smirked.\n\nAnd there it was.\n§tSOMETHING.§!\n\nI don't know if the words I've screamed were even in my language. I roared. I dragged him to his knees. I started beating the shit out of him, and when he was lying bloodied on the ground, only then I pulled my pistol. I didn't ask any questions, I didn't care if he was the one who did it. I needed §tJUSTICE.§! My hands began to shake. My vision blurred with tears. A comrade tried to pull me back. Shouting. Orders. I didn't hear them. All I could see were the bodies in that apartment, and the memory of two little kids who used to laugh together all the time. It's all lost like tears in the rain.\n\nI shot.\nNot justice.\n§tVENGEANCE.§!"

Mydlice had always been a grey forest of blocks, but now it was a forest on fire, every window a potential barrel, every corridor a grave. From the landing on the 9th, I could see them - five of them - holed up behind a barricade of washing machines and shattered furniture on the 10th. One had a hunting rifle. Another held what looked like a homemade bomb, duct tape and nails wrapped around a gas canister.\n- Back off or we take the whole fucking floor with us! - shouted one of the gangsters.\nTheir flag, some old gang tag spray-painted on a sheet, flapped from the barricade. My CO, Lieutenant Rak, stepped out just enough to be seen, no helmet, arms raised.\n- Hey guys...don't shoot! You don't have to do this anymore - he said, voice calm like a teacher - It's over. We hold Mydlice now. There is no point in losing any more young lives to whatever this is.\n\nThe gangsters didn't answer. Probably hadn't seen sunlight in weeks. Probably didn't care anymore. Rak kept talking, buying time.\n- Look, we don't have to fight! You must be starving there, there is plenty of food in the city for all of us! You won't go to prison, I promise.\n- Joke's on you. We don't have any prisons. You'll just die - I thought.\nMeanwhile, Mikołaj and Antek were already crawling up the elevator shaft like ghosts. We could hear them above us with the occasional scrape of metal. The gang leader shouted again.\n- BETTER DEAD THAN RED!\nThen everything that could go wrong, it went wrong. The elevator cable let out a screech - rust or pressure, who knows. A voice above shrieked:\n- They're in the shaft. TORCH THEM!\nGunfire exploded. The floor shook. Someone dropped a Molotov down the elevator - flames whooshed up like a hell pit. Antek screamed. Mikołaj didn't even bother. Just went down. It was too late, but our CO ordered the breach. We managed to blow the barricade and poured into the floor. I was lucky to be in the rear. Because when we entered the last apartments, I was first in line. Smoke. Screams. Blood. One gangster was shooting blindly, eyes shut, praying. Another clutched a dead man, crying and firing a pistol with one hand. In the chaos, I saw the bomb - two gas canisters, wrapped in nails, timer blinking. I screamed. We immediately bolted. Down the stairs. Some didn't make it in time. I remember the sound - not like in the movies. Not one explosion. More like the block exhaling fire. The tenth floor blew out in a rain of glass and body parts.\n\nBack outside, covered in ash, I looked up at the blackened ruin. Why would anyone be willing to die for something so...trivial?\n- It's over boys - said Lieutenant Rak"

dgr_district.20.desc: "Piekło (lit. Hell) Colony. This meeting was never supposed to happen. And yet, the leadership of the Łęknica Inquisition and the People's Front brought things to a point where nationalists were negotiating with communists. You could say - given the name of the settlement - that hell hath frozen over. On one side stood Aleksander Bargieła - leader of the nationalist militias who, over the past weeks, had gained significant ground in the never-ending gang war, pressing the Young Steelworkers hard and capturing Antoniów. On the other, Krzysztof Szwej - figurehead of the neo-communists from the People's Front faction, claiming legitimacy as the true city government. Mainly because they'd managed to capture the last mayor, Marcin Bazylak, and added him to their cabinet like some kind of Pokémon.\n\nOne - young and ambitious. He believed history had smiled on him, granting enough support to enter this warlike election for the future of Poland. The other - old and patient. He had waited nearly forty years for the opportunity to lead Poland back into the arms of communist revolution.\n- Comrade Bargieła, I'm glad you decided to attend this meeting. It is a momentous occasi... -  Szwej began, using his usual drowsy tone.\n- What's in it for me? - Bargieła cut him off mid-sentence - Mister Comrade should remember where he is. I don't care for ideological formalities. The fact I didn't come here to shoot you should be enough proof of interest. I know what you want - an army. I've got one. But what guarantees do I have? - The young man wouldn't let himself be bored to death with speeches. But that kind of negotiation style doesn't always work in every situation. Szwej's expression suddenly hardened, as if he dropped a mask.\n- Full command of the entire People's Front army, if you join us. Time for unity is now.\n\nThis time it was Bargieła who froze. Full command of the army? Either this was pure desperation - or a perfectly crafted trap. Still, it was the kind of offer that stroked his famously massive ego. So many opportunities... and just as many risks. He wasn't a seasoned politician. This game could cost him his life if Szwej outmaneuvered him. But if he didn't fall into the trap - his men would follow him, whether with God or the Devil. They could win Poland.\n- My soldiers - I don't want them indoctrinated. Our units stay autonomous. No political commissars - Bargieła replied cautiously.\n- Agreed - Szwej answered without the slightest hesitation.\nThat worried Aleksander even more. You don't trust a man who doesn't even try to haggle. But in the end, the young rebel trusted more in his own ability and infallibility than he feared the old communist. He couldn't shake the glorious vision of a national revolution rising from the ruins of the old system - led by him, commander of the armed forces. He'll worry about ideology later. After a moment of thought, Bargieła reached out his hand and said:\n- Then... Comrade. Socialism or death."

dgr_district.21.desc: "The corridor to the president's office still smelled faintly of ash and blood. Marcin Bazylak paused at the old door. The frosted glass, cracked. The brass plate with his name - scratched through. Someone had tried to pry it off. He opened the door slowly. Dust drifted in shafts of sunlight through shattered blinds. The chair had been overturned. Papers scattered. His old coat still hung on the stand in the corner, riddled with moth holes. He stepped inside like a man entering a tomb. He was away for a few months. And it looked like he was gone for decades.\n\nThe Popular Front's flag now hung where the city's crest once did. Bright red. Proud. Socialist. He sat behind the desk. The chair creaked with familiar complaint. His name wasn't on the paperwork anymore - he was no longer president. He was \"just\" the First Minister. Still, it was a responsible position. Maybe even too similarly to his old one. A social democrat, dressed in the red coat of the communists. But someone had to keep this goddamned machine turning. Outside, a burst of shouting - Front patrol sweeping the building again. It was safe. Relatively. They had secured Reden block by block, but holdouts remained. You could still hear gunfire some nights.\n\nHe found a surviving ledger and flipped it open. Water damage, half the names smudged. Permits. Housing requests. Complaints from citizens long dead. He took a pen. It worked. One of the secretaries stepped in - a girl maybe twenty, with a Kalashnikov slung across her back.\n- Comrade Minister - she said, with a barely noticeable hint of mockery - We need signatures for food ration distribution.\nHe nodded. No ceremony, no civility. Just tasks. As he signed, he glanced out the window. Smoke still curled from distant rooftops. The steelworks were operational again, trains running under armed guard. Korczaka and Majakowski streets had power for four hours a day. It was a start.\n\nHe exhaled slowly. No victory parade. No applause.\nJust rubble, reports, and a city still bleeding.\nBut someone had to do it.\nIt had to be him."

Too quiet for a city of nearly a hundred thousand souls. You'd expect something - footsteps, market shouts, even an argument. But all I hear is the wind brushing the broken glass beneath the tram lines and the faint thrum of a diesel generator humming somewhere down by the city hall. This is what Dąbrowa Górnicza has become. A city holding its breath. Sometimes I sit in this office for hours and convince myself that the silence means order. That maybe - just maybe - things are stabilizing. That the Intercounty and our city will hold. Sosnowiec says they're organizing new security patrols. Whatever's left of them - they keep promising humanitarian corridors and clean supply routes. They send maps with arrows and stamps and notes written in polite language. They mean well, I think. People always thought that Dąbrowa was in Silesia. In the voivodeship, yes. But we were never Silesians. They made sure of that.\n\nOur police station still has a dozen officers. Most of them don't leave the building anymore. They answer the radio if they're in the mood, but it's mostly for noise - to remind themselves they still exist. They don't go into Mydlice or Gołonóg. No one does. Those districts belong to others now. Manhattan Crew runs the housing blocks up north. Down in Reden, it's all in the hands of some gang called the Crank Kings - meth labs, chop shops, backroom clinics that charge in ammunition or tramadol. There are rumors that the Ziobro's raiders are trying to push into the area. I can't keep track anymore. I get reports. Or rather, frightened scribbles from residents pretending to be reports. They're mostly stories:\n- Someone saw a man shot at the Pogoria. Which one?\n- A woman in the Gołonóg market was dragged off for selling out of someone's turf. Why?\n- The smoke over the coke plant wasn't an accident. What happened?\n\nBut I tell myself it's just temporary. That the Intercounty will send reinforcements soon. That this is what a transition looks like. That we just need to ride out the storm. Only, the storm isn't here yet. That's the part that keeps me up. The city hasn't fallen. Not entirely. The lights still flicker on some nights. The old steelworks still echo with activity, though I doubt it's legal or safe. People still live here. But they don't talk much. They don't trust.\n\nI still call myself President, even though no one listens. I still come to work. I still believe someone will come."

They came from the edge of Haller's Park, where weeds had long since claimed the walkways. On their way, they picked up their fuel truck. It was liquid gold these days, and no one knows how they got their hands on it. Finally, the metal gates of the Sztygarka Museum creaked open.\n\nAleksander Bargieła stepped out first.\nHe was young-barely older than the boys behind him - but his voice carried the weight of someone who believed history had given him permission and his time was just now. Clad in a tattered green field jacket, he raised his arm, and the group followed. They moved fast. Everyone could see them out in the open on the square next to the building, and there they were - two beautiful tanks, and a lot of other military equipment. Preserved, barely functional. But functional enough. It took time for the two specialists to figure out the controls and the rest to refuel the tanks. And then, the morning quiet suddenly died. The roar of the engines shattered the calm atmosphere. Pigeons scattered from the rooftops, and the first flickers of light appeared in apartment windows across downtown. People looked out. No one said a word. Yet everyone smiled.\n\nThe tanks turned into Rose Alley. And then right onto what had once been the main street of Dąbrowa - bustling with life and commerce. Now it was cracked asphalt, burned trash, and empty bus stops. The rumble of steel tracks echoed off the buildings like thunder. Children peeked from behind curtains. Their parents pulled them back. No one came outside. No one stopped them. No one dared to. It was like Bargieła thought - those who are brave enough to claim the day will rewrite the history of this world.\nAt the corner of Graniczna Street, two of the smaller transporters that they also captured slowed. Its hatch opened, and a few dozen boys with improvised weapons climbed out and surrounded the police station. They stayed there, unmoving, harrowing. But the others rolled on.\n\nAt city hall, Bazylak was already awake. He'd heard the noise. Seen the glow from his office window. He didn't call the security, as there was no one left. Didn't try to run. He knew someone would come. He just stood behind his desk, waiting. The tanks didn't fire. They parked at the entrance like they were there to pick up someone. Bargieła and two others marched up the stairs and into the building. Minutes later, Bazylak sat with a pen in his hand, staring at the paper.\n- It's just a formality - Bargieła said calmly. - You sign. Then you're done. No harm. No exile. We're not animals. And if you won't, my men are already watching your house. Your family. So, no heroics.\nBazylak didn't argue. He wanted to be a hero, but he couldn't do anything. The silence outside spoke louder than anything he could say. The city had made its choice - or at least, stopped caring. He signed. By noon, a photocopy of the paper was taped to the city hall door. Above it, someone had scrawled in thick black ink:"

dgr.3.desc: "The room smelled faintly of damp concrete and old paper. The chairs didn't match, the lights flickered, and you could occasionally hear some loud sounds. Sometimes they were explosions, and sometimes just the sound of the machinery. Kaja sat near the corner, and the clack of her typewriter was already echoing off the walls of the half-burnt office in the Steelworks they now called the Hall of the Popular Council. The name felt like a joke. It's just a ruined office. She wasn't anyone important - just a secretary for the Popular Front, drafted from the administration office of the clinic next to the steelworks. They needed someone \"with clean hands\" to take the minutes. She was clean, alright. Clean and quietly bitter.\n\nThe first to arrive was Krzysztof Szwej. Geriatric, coughing into his sleeve, smelling of mothballs and ideology. She remembered him from the 1st May parades, waving flags and babbling about proletarian rebirth while the tram ticket price tripled. Next came Marcin Bazylak. Once president, now a diminished persona with sunken eyes and oversized suit. Kaja's aunt worked in the city office under him, unpaid for six months, surviving on expired canned goods. Now he was a \"minister\". Minister of what? Regret?\n\nBas Tajpan entered like a rap star - gold chains, dreads, flashing a peace sign. \"Comrades\", he said with a grin. She remembered the basement parties in Broadway and the shady deals. He used to run with gangsters before rebranding as a \"grassroots social democrat\". Doctor Zbigniew Podraza followed, calm as always. Kaja remembered her mother sitting for hours in line under his administration, just to be told there was no doctor that day. She eventually passed away because nobody would take care of her. Dying grounds. That's what they called an emergency ward under his rule.\n\nThen there was a man in uniform. The police officer. Kaja didn't recognize him, but the badge on his chest made her uneasy. Someone whispered he used to run internal investigations. She wondered how many bodies he walked over to get here. They all nodded to each other like old friends, like survivors of a shipwreck. Maybe they were. Perhaps we're all in one now. She typed as they spoke of reconstruction, of unity, of \"building a new Dąbrowa Górnicza from the ashes\". But as long as they were blabbering, they couldn't even agree on what kind of coffee they wanted. Not like there was anything but the cheapest stuff. She typed through their posturing, their big plans, their confusing speeches, where every next one contradicted the former ones. She typed and wondered how many more lives they'd ruin before the dust settles. Outside, a siren wailed. Somewhere, someone was still fighting.\n\nAnd in this room, they dared to call themselves a government. They don't govern. They command."

dgr.4.desc: "Marcin Bazylak sat in the hallway like a student who'd gotten into trouble and was waiting outside the principal's office. He looked completely out of his depth, his round, boyish face marked with honest confusion. That wouldn't have been such a problem - if not for the fact that he was here as an emissary from Dąbrowa, sent to speak with Włodzimierz Czarzasty himself. Szwej had sent him simply because Bazylak belonged to the New Left and had some connection with the leader of Sosnowiec. His task was to negotiate aid for Dąbrowa to help them reclaim control over the city. Quietly, Bazylak started muttering the points he had to raise during the conversation. The recent events had taken a toll on him. At some point, a young secretary stepped out of one of the offices and addressed the former mayor directly, inviting him inside. Bazylak took a deep breath and walked in as confidently as he could in that moment. But all the energy he'd built up drained from him instantly when he saw that Czarzasty was not there.\n\nInstead, sitting in his place was his deputy, Anna Maria Żukowska. A cold sweat washed over Bazylak. Though there had never been any bad blood between them, Żukowska had a reputation as the Iron Lady of the Left. Or, as some unkind tongues liked to say, a cold-hearted bitch.\n- Marcin - she greeted him - It's good to see that Dąbrowa still has someone left to send.\nHe tried to shake her hand, but she didn't offer hers and gestured toward the chair. Bazylak attempted to outline the Popular Front's request - aid in retaking southern districts and Mydlice, fuel shipments, maybe even a battalion of their \"volunteer militia\". He kept it polite, practical, yet he did sound desperate. Żukowska listened patiently, nodding, tilting her head like she would inspect a stray dog. But she counted every time he added something to the never-ending list of pleas. At some point, she just raised her hand, telling him to shut up. And he did.\n- I read your reports. Quite the mess you've made. And I'm just about curious to hear how you've managed to lose your seat to some old geezer from the previous era. Tragic, really. But those are your problems. And tell me, why...should we suffer from your failures? - Żukowska exclaimed calmly while sipping her tea.\n- B-but...the Intercounty, the alliance! - Bazylak started panicking\n- t-t-he aLLiAncE - she mocked him - Come on. You want volunteers, gasoline, and weapons. And what do we get? Another broken city, run by an aging communist and a choir of burned-out bureaucrats? We've got Będzin for that niche. If you are not able to pull your weight in this partnership, we're not going to rescue you every time you cry for mommy. Get. Your. Shit. Together. And come back when we can talk as equals. For now, the case is closed. I'm sorry for all that it's worth. Really.\nBazylak, as the good pupil he is, nodded, bowed his head slightly, and left. Outside, the cold hit him like a slap. Back at home, Szwej would ask if they agreed to help. And Bazylak would lie."

A beautiful park turned into a permanent drug rave with a suspicious amount of fog. I rolled in mid-evening. Air was thick with smoke and pine. Someone was riding a bicycle with no wheels. A half-naked girl painted in glitter whispered to a tree. Three guys argued about whether Żabka was a capitalist psyop or a reptilian brand. The stage? Made from pallets and an old Żuk truck. My kind of place. I climbed up, lit a joint someone handed me, grabbed a mic hooked up to a speaker and started talking.\n- Peace, brothers. Front wants ya to disband. Go home. Babylon is gone, reintegrate with your homies in da city.\nSomeone booed. A goat bleated. I panicked and rapped something about unity and ganja and Dąbrowa districts. It rhymed, but didn't make sense. They loved it. People screamed. Why? A fire dancer set part of his pants on fire and called it \"performance\". I saw a guy trying to eat a vinyl record. A kid with no shoes handed me \"spice tea\" in a cracked Hello Kitty mug. I drank. Shouldn't have. Next thing I know, I'm conducting a wedding between two dudes and a broken satellite dish. Someone claimed they saw John Paul II in the smoke. I believed them. Suddenly, it's a parade. People started following me out of Camp Zielona. No plan. Just vibes. I think I yelled something like:\n- Let's go bring the bass back to the city, my lions!\n\nAnd they followed. Almost a hundred high lunatics, two goats, three dogs, and a guy with a broken didgeridoo who kept playing anyway. Some carried tiki torches made from broom handles and lube-soaked rags. One guy wore a tent like a cape. We hit the main road. But man, feet aching and stomachs rumbling and suddenly vibes turn from revolution to satan's invention - munchies. We made it maybe half a kilometer before the rest started complaining. Even I start feeling it. The revolution can wait, but the munchies? Nooo, brother. That's war.\n- Oy, Bas, where's the food ministry at, man?\nSo there we are, midnight outside the main railway station, the rave of Camp Zielona now turned into the People's Snack March. Whole commune of hunger, high as soviet satellites, planning next move. And I, Bas Tajpan, chosen by fate, look to the stars and ask:\n- Haile Selassie, tell me is there still a kebab open in the centre?\nNo answer. Only wind. And the distant rumble of a hungry future. I looked around at my glittery, confused followers. The revolution paused. Our eyes met, red and glassy.\n- There's a burger shack in Reden, I think - I mumbled.\n- I WANT A KEBAB, OH MY GOD, I WOULD MAKE LOVE TO SOME FUCKING BIG ROLLO WITH FRIES RIGHT NOOOOW\nAnd so, the house was divided. They're all looking at me for guidance. And I will lead them to the promised land! WITH ME, TO MORDOR."

dgr.6.desc: "Papaj never thought the day would come when he'd pray for a blackout. But now, crouched behind a broken fridge in his cluttered Reden apartment, sweat pouring down his face, he begged the gods of short circuits and blown fuses for mercy. He had always been a small fish with big dreams. The nickname Papaj stuck from his teenage years - someone said he looked like a Polish Popeye, with wiry arms and a crooked grin. The grin had faded. Now he just looked like a junkie with a shovel and a guilty conscience.\n\nThe Popular Front's troops rolled through the district three days ago. At first, he thought it was just another gang switching flags. But these guys had uniforms, megaphones, patrol schedules - and worse, people's commissars. Real pencil pushers with clipboards and a love for surprise inspections. Papaj's problem was upstairs. Two hydroponic setups, three kilos drying in the attic, and a stash buried under the tile floor of the bathroom.\n- I'm fucked - he muttered, pacing. - I'm so fucked.\nHe tried to burn the plants. Neighbors saw the smoke. He said it was a microwave fire. Dumb lie. Then he tried to dig up the stash, but the shovel hit the tile like a gong.\n- Shit! Shit! Quiet!\n\nEvery noise felt like a siren, and every voice outside like a patrol coming up the stairs. He'd managed to flush some, bury the rest in a trash bag behind the tenement. But it was too late. Word spread fast. Someone saw the lights. Someone saw the smoke. Someone always did. That evening, the intercom crackled.\n- Citizen Matejski? Open the door. People's Commissariat. We'd like to have a word.\nHis hands trembled. He looked at the shattered tile, the bag of half-burnt stalks in the sink, and the cash stuffed in cereal boxes.\n- Uhm...a moment! I'm taking a shit! - he barked, voice cracking.\nAnd then, salvation: the lights cut out. A district-wide blackout. The hum of the fridge died. Everything went still.\n\nHe didn't move. Minutes passed. Maybe they left. He started grinning again, like he outsmarted the KGB itself. Like he is...- The door burst open. Lights cut through the dark.\n- On the floor! Now! - A boot slammed into his ribs. The cereal box burst open. Coins rained down like confetti.\n- Medicinal - he whimpered, curled up. - It's medicinal.\n- Yeah? - One of the officers grunted. - I'm glad you're not even denying.\nAs they dragged him out past his front door, Papaj caught the smell of burnt plastic and crushed weed. The blackout didn't save him.\n\nIt just meant they brought flashlights."

dgr.7.desc: "I am the messenger sent eastward. The instrument, not the hand. The observer, yet never the unobserved. I am Aleksander Bargieła. We were learning that the desert was broken. But deserts are never broken. They merely await the breaking of those who step into them. The First Secretary bade me to \"deal with\" the Pharaohs. Rein them in, he had said. As if they were wild horses. As if power in the sands could be shackled by dialectics and rifles. When I arrived at Błędów, I found no gang. I found a rite. Sand as pale as bone stretched to every edge of vision, shimmering under the weight of ancient heat. The Pharaohs walked it barefoot, unarmed, unhurried - men and women adorned in rusted medals, stripped circuitboards, and linen soaked in spice. Melange. The whisper-word. The dust-of-memory. They offered it to me in silence, pressed into my palm like a sacrament. I hesitated. Then I partook.\n\nAnd in the taking, I was taken.\n\nThe spice unfolded the false continuity of time. Past became skin, future became sand. My heartbeat lost its origin and began to echo not from my chest - but from beneath the ground.\nThe worm stirs. First tremor. Then rhythm. Then sound - not heard, but felt in the teeth and spine. The sand parted. A behemoth rose: no eyes, no mercy, no reason. A god of motion and hunger. A hunger so old it felt like the voice of time itself. The Sand One. Its presence imposed meaning upon everything. The Pharaoh beside me spoke with a voice that was not merely his own:\n- You have heard it now. You know the price of stepping here.\n- I come from the city. But I bring no chains. I came to bring law, a liberation. - I said. He smiled. Not with lips, but with a stillness deeper than silence.\n- There is no law here but resonance. No authority but that which the sand allows. No return to the city you came from. You are now of us, or of nothing. The worm dove. The ground swallowed it like memory. I closed my eyes and saw the crimson sun, the ghost cities half-buried in dunes, the salt bones of the old world. The Fall. And in that vision, I felt something... alignment.\nThe desert was not lawless. It was merely beyond our vocabulary.\n- There is no going back. There is only becoming.\nAnd I became. A fraction of mysticism incorporated in this vessel. And in this moment, they all saw me as Him. The voice from the outer world. Now...I'm the one pointing the way. And upon thee, I DEMAND:\n- You have walked the broken bones of Poland. You have tasted rust in your mouths, and ash in your water. You have buried fathers in sand too dry to grieve. And now you will follow. Not as servants. Not as pawns of red banners or rusted ideologies. But as stewards of flame and sand, as keepers of the new covenant - written not on paper, but on wind-scoured stone. WE SHALL BECOME REBORN IN THE ASHES OF OUR DESERT. OUR BŁĘDÓW. OUR DUNE."

dgr.8.desc: "The Civic Reeducation and Unity Centre for Sławków was located behind walls of poured concrete, adorned with murals of red stars, cogs, wheat, and the rising sun of Dąbrowa Górnicza. Loudspeakers played The Internationale every hour, on the hour. People's Commissar Kordian Żmuda believed in repetition. He believed in rhythm, slogans, and the truth told enough times to overwrite memory.\n- Citizens of Sławków - he began each day in the main assembly - you are not prisoners. You are patients. You were infected for your whole life by this bloodthirsty illusion. A vision of freedom and capitalism. But we all fell from the consequences of those. We all sit in a destroyed state because of it. And yet, you cling to it like a moth to a light.\nŻmuda's voice dripped with confidence and warmth\n- You were taught that Sławków was independent. That you stood apart. But you were abandoned. Who fed you when the markets failed? Who protected you when the gangs came?\nHe gestured to the red banner hanging above them: DĄBROWA GÓRNICZA - OUR MOTHER.\n- It was our City. The People's Will. Not capital. Not elections. Us.\nBehind him, a film reel played. Children waving red flags. A parade of tractors. Laughing nurses. A steelworker with missing teeth hugging a commissar in tears.\n- Socialism, comrades, is not theory. It is deliverance. You suffer because you resisted your own salvation.\n\nEvery hour had a purpose. Morning: Collective Reflection, with assigned guilt-sharing. Midday: Labor Therapy - sorting screws or painting pro-Front slogans on scrap metal. Evening: the Red Circle, where everyone could watch some movies and shows together (meticulously selected by censors) and reflect upon them using a critical theory.\n- What is selfishness? - Żmuda asked one boy.\n- Crime against the collective - came the whispered reply.\n- And what is Sławków without Dąbrowa?\n- Dust... and shame.\nŻmuda nodded.\n- Truth is a burden, comrades. But under socialism, you never carry it alone. And you never walk alone. In that knowledge, in that understanding - there is strength.\n\nAfter two weeks, most requested to wear armbands bearing the hammer-and-lightning. Some even asked for roles in the New Reconstruction Battalion. Not all were convinced, but most were exhausted. And exhaustion was the seed of obedience."

Krzysztof Szwej sat at the head, hunched forward, the sleeves of his commissar's jacket rolled up. A battered ashtray overflowed beside him. Across the table, Minister of Economy - Zbigniew Podraza, scribbled figures into a stained notebook.\n- He's summoning us like subjects, - Szwej muttered, not looking up.\n- Czarzasty is a control freak. - Podraza replied. - He wouldn't suddenly announce a great congress if it weren't for his need for political machinations and spreading his influence on the rest of the alliance.\nThe Intercounty Congress, officially a \"cooperative gathering of regional partners\", had been called by Włodzimierz Czarzasty under extraordinary circumstances. But unity meant consolidation. And consolidation meant Sosnowiec swallowing Dąbrowa whole.\n- Do you know him personally? - Szwej finally asked.\n- I had this pleasure. Back when I was still the city's president. - Podraza said simply. - We saw each other mostly during the campaigns. You know, when he needed to show himself here for the voters. But what he was doing inside the party before the Fall...we're walking on thin ice here. Why not send Bazylak? Their relations are...more recent.\nSzwej smirked.\n- Bazylak has his uses, but i don't believe in his determination. If if wanted for Czarzasty to play him like a violin, i would just sign the act of annexation by the Sosnowiec instead.\n- True, but maybe that's the way, - Podraza said with a thin smile. - Let them see him meek. Then have us slide in the demands. It'll look like a compromise.\n- Besides, there will be Antifa there. We will need some heavy guns. Even if we look like we're attacking them straight ahead.\n- Don't tell me you think about...\n- Bargieła is not some communist lapdog. That's his problem - yes. But he's a patriot. He'll fight for our cause, we simply need to call \"national\" everything that we used to call \"socialist\", and he'll dive into the empty pool without even asking...\n- Alright then. Military, check. Economy, check. You take the rest. They will want to pressure us into something. We should play like economists. He opens with unity, you counter with coordination. He suggests centralization, you propose resource-sharing. Soft terms. Harmless terms.\n- But overall, we stall.\n- We stall.\nSzwej stood up and walked to the window. Beyond the shattered skyline, smog rolled over Mydlice. The Popular Front banners still held above the roofs, but barely.\n- If they try to dissolve us... - Szwej began.\n- They won't, - Podraza said. - But if they do, we walk. And take the workers with us."

dgr.41.desc: "Saturday night shift at the Katowice Steelworks was less a production cycle and more a long, strange episode of Trailer Park Boys, but louder and with molten metal. Mostly because there were days when the resources simply weren't on site, but the workers had to be. The foreman, Bolek \"Kaktus\" Wyrzykowski, was already two beers in when the clock hit 22:00. He leaned back in the shift office, chain-smoking under the \"OSH - Our Priority\" poster that had been burned through by a flying angle grinder last month.\n- Relax, guys, tonight we hit the quotas or die trying - he declared, raising another beer in toast.\n- We ain't got any fucking coal! - screamed Leszek from the furnace hall - Are we supposed to heat the steel with your fucking balls?\n- Rubber burns hot, no? Soviet magic, I swear. It's not like you have gas for your wheels. Come on!\nAt furnace six, Paweł \"Mario\" Kalinowski had plugged his phone into the emergency panel to charge it. It caused a minor blackout in the rolling mill. Nobody cared.\n- Music makes the steel flow better, - he justified, blasting some local inaudible rap from a Bluetooth speaker duct-taped to his helmet. Somewhere near the smelting section, Krzysiek and Bartek were racing forklifts. One of them clipped a pallet of scrap and spilled it like confetti.\nAround 3:00 a.m., a guy none of them knew, but who had apparently been working there \"since the '80s,\" emerged from under the main converter and asked if anyone had seen his keys.\n- You've been under there for eight hours?! - someone asked.\n- I live here now, - he answered solemnly.\n\nBy 4:00, a crane got stuck in reverse and was slowly dragging a ladle of molten steel in a perfect circle. Kaktus just watched it spin, puffing his cigarette.\n- It's symbolic, - he said. - Like life.\nAt 5:20, a new worker named Damian panicked and hit the general alarm, thinking it was the coffee machine. The entire night shift evacuated to the parking lot and smoked nervously in high-vis jackets while waiting for fire trucks to arrive, then after almost half an hour, they realized that there still wasn't any fire brigade in the town. Seeing as everything was technically fine, they came back inside.\nBy 6:00, production logs were forged, burnt, or both.\nKaktus signed off the shift report with a barely legible scrawl and one last statement:\n- Another beautiful night with productivity of 179%. They should give us medals soon, yes?"

The last patrol had reported nothing but burned storefronts and the smell of piss in the stairwells. But someone - probably some idiot commissar in the Central Command - gave both the 3rd Platoon of Łęknice Inquisition and the 1st Platoon of 2nd Red Banner Battalion orders to \"secure the area\". Two units. One city block. And a long-standing grudge between them. Communists and nationalists didn't trust each other. They'd fought side by side during the worst days of the reconquest, sure - but no one forgot the slurs, the insults, the songs, the whole damn history. They met outside the boarded-up Lewiatan. Ten men on each side. Red armbands on the left. Black armbands with red lightning on the right.\n\n- Oi! This is our patrol zone - said Corporal Cichy from the 3rd Platoon, arms crossed, chin up.\n- Bullshit. We were assigned here this morning - replied Sergeant Żwirecki, already chewing his lip. For a few seconds, it was just words. Then someone mentioned Wujek Mine '82. Then someone laughed. Then someone called someone a traitor. Then someone else asked if they'd like to repeat Katyń. A rifle was raised - only for show - but the other side didn't read it that way. The gunshot was an accident. A twitch, maybe. A flinch. Private Szczęsny of the Inquisition fell backward like a sack of flour. Hit in the neck. Died before anyone could scream. Nobody moved. Except Żwirek, who knelt down and screamed until he had no breath. Then everyone moved at once. Weapons were cocked. Someone yelled for revenge. Someone else started calling for backup.\n\nIt was about to go nuclear. And then, like they were god-sent, one lone patrol of Military Police arrived. There were only three officers, but they didn't care - they rolled in fast and hard. Lights on. Speakers barking orders. Soldiers looked flabbergasted.\n- PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS. NOW.\n- LIE ON THE GROUND. FACE DOWN.\nThe MPs didn't ask twice. They started pulling people from each side, cuffed them, slammed them on the pavement. Major Kulesza stepped into the middle of the street. He looked down at the body, then looked at the silent crowd.\n- You idiots realize you're on the same side? Friendly fire...only in this fucking city.\nNo one answered. He took off his gloves, lit a cigarette.\n- One dead. Over what? Colors on a damn armband? Talk about unity...\n\nThe Lewiatan sign still flickered above them: TWO BREADS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE."

Nerka's jammed with transports and militia...\n- You've said that three times! - Bargieła snapped - JESUS, WHO TAUGHT YOU TO DRIVE? TURN HERE, NEXT ONE RIGHT.\n- Oh, for God's sake... - Podraza groaned from the back seat. Besides an angry and bitter army chief, in the car there were also Krzysztof Szwej, pale and sweating, and Zbigniew Podraza, with folded arms and the face of a grumpy cat.\n- No! You listen to me! - Bargieła shouted, twisting around toward Szwej. - He wasn't supposed to be there! Bazylak! That worm, that coward! Sitting next to Czarzasty like his fucking intern! We were supposed to push, show strength! Instead, we shook hands and let them walk all over us!\n- You think this is helping? - Podraza snapped, unusually sharp. - You think screaming will undo the vote? It's politics, not a firing line.\n- Then maybe it should be a firing line! - Bargieła spat. - Because what we saw in that hall wasn't politics. That was betrayal in neat suits and polite applause.\n- I was trying to keep us from blowing the alliance to pieces! - Szwej snapped, but it came out thin. Unconvincing.\n- There it is. That bark. The rabid dog always wants war - Podraza laughed bitterly.\n- What i want, is a little fucking respect! We got none of that back there! You think your smug face and your spreadsheet talk bought us time? It bought us a leash! - continued Bargieła\n- Better a leash than a bullet! You want to burn half the counties over your wounded ego?\n- My ego?! - Bargieła lunged forward. - I've bled for this movement!\n- That's enough! - Szwej shouted, voice cracking like old wood. - Both of you!\nThe car bounced over a pothole. The driver yelped and swerved around a pile of rubble.\n- Shit, sorry! Roadblock ahead again!\n- They can move on Sławków and Strzemieszyce within days. - Podraza continued, breath heaving. - Sosnowiec pulls support, and we lose the railways. The Steelworks and logistics get cut off. The army splits.\nSzwej blinked, pale. - If we lose the army, we lose everything. But we didn't lose anything yet. War isn't coming. It was already here.\nNeither Podraza nor Bargieła didn't responded. Their eyes were locked on the darkened streets rolling past. Silence fell again, heavy and wet like the rain outside."

dgr.11.t: "Whistling in the Dark"
dgr.11.desc: "An unbroken veil of darkness swallowed the Zagórze district. Two city-states, Dąbrowa Górnicza and Sosnowiec, stood on the edge of war - once bound by alliance, now locked in a silent standoff, each waiting for the other to blink. Tension hung thick; the Dąbrowa basin was a powder keg with a lit fuse. The old Intercounty was no more - only echoes remained, drowned beneath the rising storm. Route 94 divided the frontline. On the one side, Dąbrowa, on the other, Sosnowiec. Dąbrowa soldiers, being in a slightly worse position, sat in the trenches just before the road. On the other hand, Sosnowiec troopers could use the Alba building as a fortified position overlooking the plains ahead.\n\nKamil Zając was not a man easily shaken. He was a plain, straightforward Pole, raised on honest work and simple values. Dąbrowa Górnicza, the city of his parents and grandparents, all factory workers like himself, was more than his birthplace; it was his anchor. Kamil believed in fairness and equality, but he had never been drawn to communism. He was, above all, a patriot; a man willing to give his life for his home. Yet now, as a young sergeant, that conviction was clouded by something deeper: the thought of his wife and beautiful daughter. The idea of leaving them behind, of vanishing from their lives, was more terrifying than any battlefield.\n\nLieutenant Mateusz Maj stood opposite the barricade, quietly instructing his unit on what to do if the Dąbrowa eventually attacks. Yet he could not shake the feeling that the whole thing was wrong. Dąbrowa and Sosnowiec had just a few weeks ago marched under the same red banners. Now, divided by nothing but their leaders' unchecked ambitions, they found themselves on opposite sides of a fratricidal conflict. Once, he was an ambitious man, working closely within the party, and expecting a promotion at any time. However, a little bit of honesty placed him at the front line.\n\nThe two men had once been friends. Before the fighting, before the orders and the uniforms, they spent countless weekends together fishing at Pogoria Lake. It had been their ritual - early mornings with thermoses of hot tea, quiet conversations broken only by the soft splash of a line hitting the water. They never spoke much about politics; they did not need to. What bound them was something simpler: shared silence, the rhythm of casting and reeling, the comfort of a friend by your side. And now, they had no idea that they had become enemies, and sooner or later,  would meet again on the battlefield. Tensions on both sides reached a breaking point when a whistle echoed along the long-abandoned road. Soldiers immediately reached for their weapons, bracing for the worst. But within moments, they realised the battle had not begun, at least not yet. Perched on a rusted streetlamp, an owl hooted toward the full moon, its call sharp and haunting in the still night. A collective sigh of relief swept through the trenches. For now, the silence held. One wrong move from either side could snap this tension in half. Yet they could do nothing for now but wait."

dgr.12.desc: "It was the dark of night. They never agreed to meet at any other time. Perhaps that way they could feel more detached from those they were about to sentence or simply to make it harder for any eventual partisan to figure out their identity should things go wrong. The room they occupied was dark, damp, and considerably cramped, even for the three of them, adding to the discomfort. In front of them - a list. A simple list, filled with the names of those unlucky enough to back the wrong shade of red. Fellow party members, former colleagues, old friends, and family members - all no longer considered trustworthy enough to go unpunished. Their fate now rested in the blood-stained hands of the Commissars, the most dedicated and fanatical faction of the KPP. \n\n- Up against the wall with 'em! - Unsurprisingly, the most senior of the trio broke the silence, expressing the most radical of the possible demands. \n- Comrade Nowak, maybe we should give them a second chance? - The counter from the newest among the Commisars was just as expected. Even before his appointment, the two had clashed over matters of ideological purity. \n- How many more chances are we supposed to give them, huh? It always ends the same way. How much longer are we going to treat them as some helpless innocents? They made their own choice, and now they're going to face the consequences. \n- And with that approach, soon we won't have any true communists left. We've all made mistakes along the way. We can still turn them into something useful. What do you think, comrade? - He turned to the third Commissar, hoping for any kind of possible support. \n- Well, to be honest, it's a really tough choice. On the one hand, we really don't know if any of them can actually be trusted. People will say and swear anything just to avoid getting shot. But it is true that showing leniency could help with our personnel issues. We need more people in our ranks, even if they're of questionable quality. - The usual tiebreaker was considering his options. Though he often stayed on the sidelines of most conflicts, his ability to serve as a neutral arbiter has made him a veritable institution in the party structures. \n- Look, it's true that their recent actions have been far from commendable, and our official instructions demand otherwise, but... you both know many of those people. You spent plenty of time together, worked together, drank together... back when times were simpler. \n- Mhm, are you harboring sympathies for these reactionaries, comrade? You're even starting to sound like one of them. Is that something we need to address? \n- No, just... can we maybe not shoot everybody this one time? \n- Fair point. - The deciding vote interjected. - But if we show leniency, and they end up stepping out of line, we'll have a lot of explaining to do as to why we let them slip through the cracks. I'm not sure if that's worth the risk. I feel like either way, we're making the wrong choice."

Mareczek - or, properly speaking, Marek Stolarczyk - and Krzysztof Grejda were officials sent by the People's Front to conduct socio-political reconnaissance. Their task: to figure out what the hell to do with the leftover commune councils still operating like ghosts of the previous regime.\n- So what now, Krzysiek - muttered Marek, shifting in his old coat and adjusting the badge with the People's Front emblem - do we call the commissars or the army HQ?\n- That's the thing. Commissars'll show up, start blabbing about \"ideological potential of the community\", \"opening dialogue with the commune councils\"... Maybe we can flip some of the young ones to our side.\n- Or maybe they spit in their faces and we come back with our dicks in our hands. And guess who'll get blamed? Us. I'm not carrying the weight for those amateurs - they ain't the brightest.\n\n- Then there's the army... - Grejda paused, like he was speaking of some primal force. - Clean. Simple. They roll in, secure the perimeter, bam - four trucks, two loudmouths on the ground, three cuffed, some shots in the air, and it's quiet for a month.\n- Problem with the army - Marek interjected - is once they roll in, no one knows who survives. This ain't gangland Mydlice, this is still Jaworzno. People here have some hope left. Bit of civilization, even.\nJózek took a swig. He glanced at the nearby bench, where someone had once scratched the sign KURWA 1994.\n- Maybe we split the difference. Report says the situation's... fluid. Recommend the soft option, but we're ready to go hard.\n- So no decision, but at least the bottle doesn't go to waste - Heniek summed up.\n\nSilence fell. A battered Jelcz bus rolled through the square, blasting The Internationale from a rooftop loudspeaker. Somewhere, a dog barked. On the horizon, smoke drifted - maybe a fire, maybe tires.\n- We'll call Białas - Stolarczyk said suddenly. - He's got someone at the precinct. He'll know if the councilors are just barking, or ready for a real punch.\n- And if they're not? We give the signal to the Greens from the unit.\n- We'll see who breaks first - said Józek with a grin.\nHeniek stood up, corked the bottle, and slipped it under his coat.\n- People's democracy in action, my friend.\n- Damn right - said Józek. - Grand, but finesse."

Yet, since 2010, the city had remained under the steady hand of the left: first out of habit, then perhaps faith, and finally - curiously - because it worked. Zbigniew Podraza, former mayor of Dąbrowa Górnicza and veteran of the old social-democratic machine, stepped out of the train on the Częstochowa main railway station. He adjusted his coat, still smelling faintly of town halls and stale coffee, and walked toward the Archdiocese Office - though he wouldn't be stopping there. Instead, he had an appointment in a modest side building near the PPS headquarters. His host was Comrade Wojciech Konieczny - senator, doctor, and, as some jokingly called him, the Red Prior of Częstochowa. They met over black tea and cold sandwiches. No ceremony, no recording devices. Just two old doctors sitting across each other, eyeing a new path.\n- How's the monastery doing? You're allowing pilgrims, right? - Podraza began.\n- Yes, although we're running tight security now. We can't admit to the party that we're open to religious events all around.\n- Yes. Inappropriate. Although, maybe not for long. They couldn't destroy the church back in the previous century. And I think we are the ones to learn from this. We've got the dogmas, the Church has theirs. But maybe - just maybe - we can borrow a bit from both.\n- You're suggesting... reconciliation? - Konieczny raised an eyebrow.\n- I'm suggesting fusion. You know the scripture. Jesus fed the poor, healed the sick, and kicked bankers out of temples. The man wasn't exactly an entrepreneur. We can spin it. We should spin it. Jesus Christ - the vanguard of the socialist revolution.\n- The Church isn't short on icons. But it is short on relevance now. The youth walk away. The old hold on. We could give it a new breath - interrupted Konieczny - That's what I was trying to do this whole time.\n- And that's why I'm here. Your popular religious movement - Zbigniew continued - rooted in the Polish Catholic tradition, sure - but preaching material justice. A sacred welfare state. Saint Joseph with a union card.\n- Of course - Konieczny said slowly - the bishops don't like it already. And neither will Szwej.\n- We don't need those relics - Podraza replied. - Just a few open-minded priests. A chapel or two. Enough to show we're not enemies of faith. We're its heirs. And I'll deal with our leader. He'll agree.\n- Okay, I'll take care of some local friendly priests. Make them preach something soft for now. Something about loaves and fishes. - Konieczny said - Then we need to meet with the unions. Ask them if they're ready to kneel without selling their souls.\n- The PPS never dies, does it? - Zbigniew chuckled.\n- Only gets resurrected - Konieczny replied smiling."

And he wasn't just anyone - it was Jerzy Brzęczek himself. After the capitulation of the Truskolasy Free Club Association, he had been interned in Dąbrowa Górnicza. He wasn't free, but he wasn't quite a prisoner either. The Party's Central Committee was undecided about his fate, and so Brzęczek was temporarily sentenced to torture-watching matches of Dąbrowa's regional league teams. It was far from a pleasant sight.\n- They're not playing worse than the Polish national team - said Bargieła. The commander of the armed forces was here for one reason: to evaluate whether Brzęczek was worth recruiting. And why had they sent a nationalist rebel for the job? The Politburo had proudly declared they didn't want such a reactionary in the Central Committee, but he might still be useful as a staff element, helping to train soldiers. After all, how different is football training from military drills? Both sides shoot, defend, and attack.\n- Has the Politburo made any decisions? - Brzęczek asked.\n- They're incapable of deciding anything. They'll do what I recommend. What we need are people who can see potential in others and shape diamonds out of coal. And as you know, sir, we've got no shortage of coal.\n- \"Sir\"? I thought you people didn't have Sirs, only Comrades - the former coach now stared at Bargieła as if he were a mismatched wheel on a shopping cart. Or was it just a psychological game?\n- We don't need more red comrades bowing daily to portraits of Gierek or Stalin. I need people of action. Titles don't matter here - replied Bargieła, as passionate as ever. Brzęczek got the sense there was a double game being played here, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to be part of it. But the opportunity was real, and it would be a shame to waste the potential on offer.\n- How much freedom will I have when it comes to training methods? - Brzęczek feared a repeat of the PZPN days, where pressure from above and below forced him into changes he never truly believed in, hurting his vision of coaching. At least, that's what he always believed.\n- As far as I'm concerned, you can make them run around the Politburo with German flags. I'll take full responsibility. All I need from you is results. Not style. Not following some Soviet manual. Just results. That's all."

dgr.16.t: "Dine on Ashes"
dgr.16.desc: "The chandeliers above the grand hall of the Zagłębie Palace of Culture dripped soft light like candlewax, golden and heavy. Outside, music blared, drums rolled, and a military parade swept down the streets of Będzin like a flood. Fireworks screamed into the sky, coloring the smog with red and gold, but none of that brightness reached the table at the center of the banquet hall. There sat five men, crowned in victory, surrounded by steaming platters and silver carafes of bitter wine. The room was warm with applause, yet inside, the air had gone cold. Here, the great hall was a battlefield of another sort.\n\nSzwej sat with a posture too perfect, too rehearsed. His face was unreadable and hands folded in front of his plate as if in prayer. There was something theatrical in his stillness. He had bled for this revolution - so he said - but no one at the table believed he would stop at blood. He watched the others like a hunter watching a campfire from the woods. Bargieła toyed with his knife. A soldier's hands, but not a soldier's heart. He wore the green of the National People's Army like it weighed too much. His shoulders were broad but hunched. Every so often, he looked toward the doors, as if expecting them to burst open, as if the applause outside were the thunder of boots instead of joy. Opposite him, Zbigniew Podraza drank slowly, silently, his face was grave and pale like he just received some bad news. Next to him, his former protege - Marcin Bazylak. He had ruled before, and now rules again - but power reclaimed is never the same as power first won. Many things can be said about Damian Krępa but restraint is not one of those things. He completed this whole set of pawns with an ironic twist. Krępa was never supposed to last, but he survived other predators waiting for him to fall. And he starts to enjoy it.\n\nBargieła was somewhat nervous inside. His eyes, once bright with passion and aggression, were darker now. He looked at Bazylak and saw confusion. At Podraza, and saw something he couldn't yet name - and that frightened him more than anything else. Bas Tajpan sat closest to the wine, refilling his glass too often, too quickly. His charisma was effortless, but the lines at his mouth betrayed his fear. He was the revolution's song, its firebrand, the politburo's link to the people - but prophets don't always live to see the world they prophesy. And now that the storm had passed, he saw the silence for what it was: a gathering wind. And Szwej. Oh, Szwej, always like a stone. Unblinking. Unmoving. He had no words tonight, only eyes. Eyes that weighed, measured, remembered. But those eyes can't see the future, Bargieła thought. And that's reassuring. They all raised their glasses when the parade reached its climax. They all smiled when the soldiers saluted and the sky cracked with celebratory flame. But in the flicker of those artificial stars, none of them looked at the fireworks. They looked at each other. And each wondered - not if the revolution would devour its children - but who would be the first meal."

dgr.17.desc: "With great possibilities come great dangers. And where does that leave me? With a population this vast, the chance that you're someone exceptional on a macro scale is slim. We watch the ants scurrying in perfect harmony and forget that we ourselves are those ants. Too often, we are trained - mechanically - to not think for ourselves. Yet what separates us from the animal kingdom is precisely our ability to choose consciously, to deduce, to apply a moral lens to reality. Aristotle wrote that the ability to distinguish good from evil, justice from injustice, is what makes us human. So why do we so readily surrender that responsibility to others? Are we incapable of doing it ourselves? Or do we simply not want to anymore? Do we no longer have the time? This societal problem can be seen as the result of advancing technology and the globalization of everything that can be globalized. But the control of the masses is nothing new. History is the key to the future - because otherwise, humanity will be doomed to act out the same tragedy for centuries to come. Only the actors and props change. \n\nWhat does it matter that life still has so much to offer me, if it never gave me anything in the first place? Everything I have, I had to claw out for myself. I have to come to terms with the fact that even when there's a glimmer of hope, it's an illusion - a mirage. Because even when I tried my absolute best, it still wasn't enough. Life still told me one thing, clearly and without mercy: \"Fuck you.\" What is this monologue even about? Is it the rambling of someone stripped of any positive emotion? A political manifesto whispered to oneself on a bench outside a corner store? How can anyone in a situation like this be expected to stay calm, to keep nerves of steel? And yet. A broken heart hurts more than the moral dilemma of executing political prisoners. The farther away they are, the worse it gets for them. We are an endless chain of crimes - capable of destroying entire microcosms of life in the name of one ideology or another with a flick of the wrist. Because we can. Because here, we have some semblance of control. And it intoxicates us. Makes it seem like, in doing so, we can finally repay ourselves for all those years when fate took everything from us and left us powerless.\n\nRed, black, blue - it doesn't matter. Blood looks the same in every color. We could stop. We could break the damned cycle, redirect the whole machine down a different path. But we won't. Or maybe we just don't want to. We've made ourselves comfortable here, even though we hate every minute of what our choices have led to. We've become so good at cutting ourselves off from reality that every sacrifice becomes acceptable.\n\nAs long as it hits far from us. We are prisoners of a system we built ourselves. We are guilty of the monstrous regime we continue to create. And I, Aleksander Bargieła, above all else - I am guilty of being human."

This isn't just some petty title - it's a deeply responsible post! I must plan every room, every event, every single minute detail down to the second. All in strict accordance with protocol and ideological doctrine! There is no room for mistakes. There is no room in my head for defeatist thoughts. Even a fleeting doubt could be a crime. No, no! I must keep my nerves in check. From Congress organizer to regional assistant to the Secretary of the Delegate for the Congress - just one step! But that step must be taken with the grace worthy of a man of socialism.\n\nThe entire main boulevard of our capital will be lined with red banners and national flags. Above the entrance to the palace, we'll hang a giant red star. Red carpet. Red wine. I'll even paint the assistants and waiters red if I have to! Behind the podium, we'll display a massive banner praising our predecessors and their achievements. Framing our politicians against the backdrop of heroes will lend their actions historical gravity. But what if it makes them look small in comparison? Oh, God. No. We don't have time to change it. The curtain - yes, it's still hanging. It'll serve as a safeguard. Good. The slogan? Ah, yes. Our propaganda officers spent days debating what guiding thought should hang from the walls of the grand hall. For sure, \"WE WELCOME THE DELEGATES OF THE WORKING CLASS TO THE FIRST WORKING CLASS UNITY CONGRESS\" will be placed above the entrance. Wait. Why does it say \"working class\" twice? Argh! It reads like it was written by a six-year-old! Do we have no alternative? Well... fine. Call the kindergarten and tell them to send over a few classes. We'll blame the kids - stylistic mistakes are forgivable when made by children.\n\nI'll have to review the rest of the slogans, just in case. I can't let some incompetent buffoons from propaganda ruin my grand opportunity! \"The Party at the Helm,\" \"The Guiding Thought of the Nation,\" \"We Forge Our Tomorrow Today\"-yes, yes, yes, it all checks out. So then: first, the reception for the delegates, followed by refreshments, then the official welcome, the speech by the First Secretary of the Party Central Committee, and performances by young pioneers from the Ząbkowice House of Culture.

He shaved precisely at 5:15, ate breakfast at 6:00, and slept at 22:00 sharp, always under a framed portrait of Gierek frowning down at him. So when a cacophony of howling, accordion music, and what sounded suspiciously like a dying goat echoed from the eastern barracks at 02:13, Józef rose from his cot with fury bubbling in his chest and a flashlight trembling in his hand. He marched through the mist, boots splashing in the muck. The barracks loomed like drunken silhouettes - fitting, he thought grimly. This was the new nationalist militia unit, freshly integrated into the National People's Army. \"Integrated,\" of course, being the official term for \"barely house-trained\" and \"straight outta the forest.\" The noise grew louder: slurred songs about \"commie bastards,\" curses at the Politburo, and the unmistakable crack of vodka bottles being opened. Józef's left eyelid began to twitch. He kicked open the door. What he saw might have killed a lesser man.\n\nThree militiamen lay sprawled on mattresses dragged into a circle. One was wearing a tankist helmet, nothing else. Another had his foot in a chamber pot. A third - Private Markowski, the little bastard - was swaying while urinating into a metal bucket, singing Rota... through tears. And then Józef saw it. The red silk banner of the 2nd Battalion  - hand-embroidered, now bunched up between two bare-assed troopers, who were laughing while drunkenly wiping themselves with it. Wiecheć made a sound. Half-sob, half-scream. Like a pig being crucified.\n- WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?! - he shrieked. - WHAT IN THE NAME OF DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM ARE YOU DOING?!\n\nThe men froze. One hiccupped. The room stank of feathers and stale alcohol. Markowski, still mid-stream, turned like a deer in headlights and pissed directly onto a stack of party manuals. Then came the swan. It flapped out of the adjoining shower room with the arrogance of nobility and a string of party armbands tangled around its long neck like stolen jewelry. It honked loudly and pecked at Officer Józef's boot.\n- IS THAT A FUCKING SWAN?!\n- From Pogoria, sir... - one muttered. - It followed us back from the lake, and we... sort of adopted it.\n- You drunken, pig-ignorant shits! THIS IS A MILITARY UNIT, NOT A NATIONALIST NUDIST CAMP!\n- We were celebrating the People's Triumph, sir! - someone slurred.\n- TRIUMPH?! - Józef's voice cracked like dry wood. - T-TRIUMPHHH?

You'd think The Fall would've killed it off. Far from it. With the collapse of megacorporations, malls, and shopping centers, market trade was now having its second golden age. Not even during the capitalist glory days of the '90s had this many people shown up, trying to flog whatever junk they had. And just like back then, you could buy absolutely anything here - legal or otherwise. This didn't sit well with the central government. They feared places like this didn't promote healthy collectivism, but instead were festering pits of contagious capitalism, where price gouging, swindles, and haggling were alive and well. So the newly formed Commission for the Dismantling of Capitalist Structures eagerly leaped into action, dispatching several bureaucrats to the market with an official proclamation.\n\nBut no ideological zealot can truly grasp the mind of a Polish vendor - no regime scares a man who once sold knockoff jeans out of a coffin. And these poor functionaries were about to learn that the hard way. Their leader stepped into the square, raised a megaphone, and began passionately reading:\n\n- Working people of cities and countryside! You stand in a nest of capitalist perversions! Capitalism is a cancer! A tumor of speculation! A parasite sucking the veins of the worker! Our sacred duty is to free you from the shackles of this rotten system! Join us - in the Cooperative of People's Prosperity! The only righteous path is collective cooperation! The more you share, the more your bowl will be plentiful!

Go fuck your cunt friends as a collective! - yelled the fishmonger, hurling a crucian carp like a Molotov. Bottles flew. Old tomatoes. A bicycle seat.

The old guy said they dumped it between the lathes and the crownless coats of arms.\nMarek and Maciek had been combing the basement of the Technical Educational Centre for over an hour, hunting for a certain treasure. Not scrap, not riches, not something to sell. The newly appointed school director, Zenon Kociołek, had ordered them to haul up the bust of Soviet Marshal Ivan Konev from the depths of the school's forgotten storage rooms. All just to curry favor with the party housed next door at city hall.\nThe bust itself had only stood for two years. Unveiled in January 1989-right as the regime of the People's Republic of Poland was on its last legs - it had been taken down in the autumn of the following year. The marshal's time in the school courtyard was brief, but he wasn't destroyed. Instead, he was hidden in the deepest darkness of the basement, waiting for his moment. And now, forty years later, the marshal was finally to adorn the Technical Educational Centre once again with his radiant presence and flawless Soviet liberator physique.\n\n- What's he even look like? - asked Marek, sweeping the floor with his flashlight.\n- Bald, in a uniform, for fuck's sake. You shining that for yourself or me? - snapped Maciek. - Point it over here. \nHe gestured toward a hulking machine blocking their path. Behind it lay a pile of assorted junk, half-covered by a dusty old tarp. Moving around was hard enough; seeing anything in that pitch-dark dungeon of a room was nearly impossible. No sunlight, no electricity, no trace of civilization reached this layer of the school.\n- Wait... fuck... I got something! - shouted Marek, tripping over a rusted hinge sticking out of the floor. - Shine it here, c'mon!\nMaciek raised the flashlight. They pulled off the tarp and fell silent.\n- Daaamn... - Marek exhaled.\n\nHe was indeed - bald, in a uniform, with a face chiseled out of mighty Soviet concrete. His nose had chipped off, and one of his epaulets had been gnawed away by time. But he still held his posture, as if ready to issue orders and liberate the oppressed people of Poland once more. Grunting and cursing, they dragged the marshal up to the surface, bumping into walls and muttering obscenities the whole way as the bust was heavy. Heavy like the conscience of a political commissar. When they finally reached the courtyard, Director Kociołek was already waiting.\n- Quick, on the pedestal! We need to be done before the inspection!\nOnly the pedestal was crooked, crumbling, and had been used as a trash heap and graffiti canvas by generations of students. They tried to lift the Marshal - but he didn't budge.\n- We'd need a crane. Or six guys - groaned Marek.\n- Don't philosophize, just lift. The Party's watching! - hissed the director through clenched teeth.\n- Watching or not, if that head falls off mid-speech, that's when the real trouble starts...\nDirector Kociołek adjusted his collar, examined the bust, and clenched his teeth."

A quick shower in the communal bathroom, then a decent shave. Gotta look decent at work, after all. At this point, most of the workers are very much up and running, so I only have to wait for like another 20 minutes for my turn. Then, at 5:30, I grab Krzysiek, and we head to the factory bar to start the day off on the strong foot with a few shots. The walk takes 30 minutes, so we get there at 6. The bartender yells something about drinking in the workplace and calls us slobs, but we tell him we're just coming down from the night shift, and he agrees to serve us. Don't know why he's complaining. A paying customer is a good customer, that's what they always told us, and this time we aren't even buying the vodka on tab. So once we're done, we start heading toward the assembly line, but since Krzysiek knows a shortcut, that only takes another half an hour. Of course, on the way, we have to stop by Krysia's corner store to each get a quarter pint for when our throats eventually get sore by midday. Eh, scratch that. Maybe two, just in case. \n\nBy quarter to 7, we reach the main factory yard, which means I have 15 minutes spare to prepare my station. After the smoke break at 11, the foreman tells us they increased the quotas again, but I don't mind. It only means two hours of overtime, which is far less than last week. Since my wing is located in the periphery, all the tables are occupied once I get to the cafeteria, which means I grab my meal and eat it back in my area. Even better, because this way, nobody can see that I'm pairing it with those bottles from earlier. \n\nThe next few hours are uneventful until, at 16, Leszek gets his foot stuck in one of the conveyors. He was a miserable old prick, though, so I have a good laugh about it with the boys. He'll be back in a week or two anyway, nothing special. Most of the managers clock out two hours later, leaving us to wrap up any remaining work. Personally, I'm quite exemplary by the department's standards; therefore, at 20:30, I can finally start making my way back to my living quarters as one of the first ones allowed to do so.

In the background, the state news was playing on the television. There was only one channel, so there wasn't much choice. And even if there had been more, only the first one was \"correct.\" A clean-cut anchor was reciting the successes of the Five-Year Plan, the chorus of support from across the country, and how terrible everything had been before the \"national revolution.\" The screen flashed red and white over and over again.\n\n- What the hell got into Józek? - Wiesława began her usual lament. - Spent his whole life saying things were better under communism, and then when it actually comes back, he goes and dies.\n- Grandma... don't start.\n- Why not? - she snapped. - I'm just saying someone finally brought some order back. In your time it was all rainbows, gays, drugs, and shootings.

Justyna fled because they interrogated her three times a week. Kamil's kiosk got torched because he said something bad about the new secretary. People are disappearing, stores are empty, and you're telling me things are better?! You know there's not even meat in the shops anymore? What you've got on the table cost a fortune. Because of the damn \"central allocation.\" Because the Party knows better how much we need. And it's barely enough.\n- Don't blaspheme at the table - she hissed. - At least those other ones aren't in charge. At least something's finally changing. Your grandfather believed in the ideals. Not in people. People are filth. They always betray. But the Party... the Party endures. Always.\nSlowly, she turned her head from the portrait and looked at the table.\n- I don't want the ham - she said quietly. - It doesn't taste right. Like... it's not from here.\nHer grandson stared at her in disbelief.\n- You didn't even try it. And what are you talking about? What Party? What ideals? These are corpses dressed in old suits, forced to pretend they're alive. If you took a walk downtown, you'd see what reality looks like instead of just watching that propaganda box. If you need anything, call me. And eat something, for God's sake, instead of brainwashing yourself! I should go. Bye.\n\nThe door slammed behind him.

But something had shifted. The once-quiet often deserted John Paul II Square, now rededicated to Edward Gierek, was brimming with life, and a sea of thousands gathered to celebrate the unveiling. Who cared that everything was still falling apart, rusted, broken, forgotten? Who cared that life remained hard, joyless, and grey? Gierek was here now, and that made everything better. The statue loomed above the crowd - tall, imposing, triumphant - casting its shadow over the decay with the greatness of the First Secretary.\n\nPeople had brought whatever they could - tables, food, and an absurd amount of vodka. To Mieczysław, it felt just like that one wedding back in the '70s, when his entire family, close and distant, had gathered to celebrate his sister's marriage. They had nothing, yet they were happy. Just like now. And all of it, he thought, was thanks to Edward Gierek. A single glance into the statue's eyes was enough to feel the power and might of communism.The celebration lasted for hours, and both the police in charge of security and the government were caught off guard. No one had anticipated that the unveiling of a simple statue would unite the people in such a powerful, collective gathering. The festivities carried on into the evening - people talked, smiled, and danced as if the collapse had never happened, as if the Gierek era had never ended.\n\nMieczysław staggered back to his crumbling flat, severely drunk but undeniably happy. The stairwell smelled of old cigarettes and damp concrete, but tonight it didn't bother him. He hummed a song he only half-remembered from childhood - something his father used to sing after too much vodka and not enough food. The light in the hallway flickered, as always, and the rusted handrail dug into his palm as he climbed the stairs one slow step at a time. But none of it mattered. For a few brief hours, life had felt whole again. For a moment, the past had returned, and even though he knew that by morning the illusion would vanish, tonight he let himself believe that Gierek was still there."

dgr.27.t: "Wheat from the Chaff"
dgr.27.desc: "For Czesław, the day he received the funding application forms for the Economic Progress Fund has been a highly anticipated affair. The lifelong farmer treated the possibility as an unexpected, yet highly welcome gift from the central government, which had come to bail him out after a series of recent poor yields. Ever the opportunist, the moment he heard that a new subsidy was becoming available, he got busy preparing his relatively middling fields to pre-emptively meet the expected requirements. In the past, he had been a diehard conservative, then an agrarian nationalist. Now, he was ready to portray himself as an ideologically pure socialist, communist, or whatever it was that he was supposed to be to align with the money funnel flowing in from the capital. \n\nCarefully opening the packet of documents, Czesław brought out his reading glasses and began to study the multitude of forms, regulations, and propaganda brochures inconspicuously thrown into the mix before eventually settling on the most important of the papers - easily distinguishable by a giant party logo covering nearly the entire front page. Skipping past the lengthy self-gratifying preamble about the glorious successes of the people's movement, the importance of agriculture, and the government's commitment to its rejuvenation, the farmer wasted no time getting to the part he was supposed to fill in. \n\nPARTY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER \n\nThat part was fully expected. In his newfound commitment to communist ideology, Czesław had already driven to Dąbrowa to confirm his affiliation the moment it became financially beneficial. He eagerly scribbled in the number, triple-checking it to make sure his well-deserved subsidy didn't accidentally end up going to one of his neighbors. After a series of standard questions, he eventually reached the first problematic section: \n\nCROP GUIDELINE COMPLIANCE \n\nThe provided reference document, beneath a seemingly mundane facade of a bureaucratic ledger, was filled to the brim with neo-Lysenkoist theories that ranged from irrational to downright harmful to the farmland. Despite his bewilderment, Czesław decided the money was worth the risk. He could always input some random information that seemed compliant, while actually ignoring the requirements and doing what he had always done. It's not like the next control was going to be anytime soon. From then on, though, the form became increasingly challenging. \n\nEXPLAIN IN ACCORDANCE WITH MARXIST THEORY HOW AGRICULTURAL MODERNIZATION BENEFITS THE PROLETARIAN STRUGGLE \n\nBefore reluctantly whipping out his ideological handbook, Czesław decided to take a look at the remaining pages of the document. Skimming through the sections that began to read increasingly like assignments. \n\nLIST THE FIVE PRIMARY AGRICULTURAL TARGETS INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT FIVE-YEAR PLAN \n\nPROVIDE AN ESTIMATE OF THE PLANNED INVESTMENTS OF THE SUBSIDY PROVIDED BY THE FUND, WITH A MINIMUM OF 80% ALLOCATED TO FURTHERING THE REVOLUTION \n\nDETAIL THE MEASURES YOU VOW TO PERSONALLY TAKE TO PROTECT AGAINST REACTIONARY SABOTAGE OF YOUR FARMLAND \n\nRealizing all this work would only account for the first of the document's multiple sections, Czesław tossed the form aside and returned to his regular work."

dgr.28.t: "Fifth Column"
dgr.28.desc: "The hall was too large, too gray, and far too silent. A heavy concrete vault pretending to be a place of justice. In theory, it was a collegial court-one meant to uphold the values of the People's State through consultation and reason. In practice, it was little more than a performative purge. Chairman Szwej sat at the center of the semicircle of power, flanked by his ministers like vultures on polished seats. Their expressions were carved in bureaucratic stone - self-important, rehearsed, and faintly bored. Across from them stood Bargieła - unshackled, unbent, and unimpressed. He didn't bow. He didn't plead. He stood like a man who had already made peace with whatever was coming. The ministers hated that. They had prepared accusations, meticulous reports, and psychological profiles. The case was tied together with ideological twine: subversive behavior, fascist sympathies, disruption of the national consciousness. A threat to the unity of the People's Front.\n- Before the collegial court stands General Aleksander Bargieła, age 36, unmarried. He completed his history studies in Kraków with distinction. We are all familiar with his service in the National People's Army - began the prosecutor, whom Bazylak recognized as Judge Wielowiejski, a man who had served as a judge for 40 years across many different regimes. - Comrade Bargieła, what did you do about Commissar Kardasz, who in 2029 attempted to establish council committees within your militias?\n- Blew his head off - Bargieła replied bluntly. - With a Luger. Nine-millimeter.\nThe council was visibly shaken by the explanation - this incident had never come to light before - but Judge Wielowiejski had heard worse in his career. He asked the general:\n- Perhaps the Comrade could elaborate?\n- He was trying to interfere with the autonomy of the units I was granted exclusive authority over. He spread propaganda among my soldiers and agitated them against me. So I shot him in the head. What more is there to explain?\n- For example, the kind of fascist ideology the Comrade uses in his brown-uniformed battalions! - exploded Minister Podraza.\n- You speak of revolution, but all I see is a stale parody of the worst regimes. You dress it up in red instead of brown, but the boots are the same. You call yourselves comrades - but you act like commissars and think like volkists. Gentlemen, the term you're looking for isn't fascist.\nHe smiled faintly.\n- It's national socialist.\nThe silence was knife-thin. One of the ministers stood up in protest. Another started listing historical differences in doctrine, citations from party congresses, and official definitions of fascism, but the words rang hollow in the air. The chamber had already heard the truth, and the truth had echoed. Szwej blinked. There was something oddly satisfying about that phrase. National socialist. The way it balanced in his mind. Familiar. Not necessarily offensive. Just... right somehow. Like a joke he almost understood. He made a note in his folder but immediately forgot why.\n- This hearing is not a political gathering, Comrade Bargieła - said Minister Podraza - You are here to answer, not to give us any moral lectures.\nBargieła laughed. A short, dry, dangerous laugh."

dgr.29.desc: "I stood in the shadow of the monument dedicated to the Heroes of Red Banners with my jaw tightened and my hand clenched around the microphone. The night was colder than expected, but the crowd was already roaring - thousands of torches were held high and their flames swaying like a burning forest. Beside them, banners of the National People's Army.\nI didn't believe in Moczar. Not really. He was a drunk, a schemer, a thug in a general's cap. But he gave me what I needed: a myth. A body to build around. An image that blurred socialism with nationalism, fear with pride. The kind of confusion you can forge into a weapon. It was my time to mold those people into an unstoppable force. I need to speak. I need them to hear me.\n\n- Citizens of the Polish nation! Brothers and sisters! Sons and daughters of this broken soil! We're here tonight to remember someone. To remember something. The blood in our veins carries the memory of workers and partisans, of war heroes and pioneers of revolution. And of Mieczysław Moczar, who knew that Poland without strength is no Poland at all.\nThe crowd straightened - eager, hollow, waiting to be filled. No applause. Not yet. That would have been too easy.\n- Make no mistake. We're here today to make something out of this remembrance day. He would not want people like us to just talk about grand visions. Moczar would've wanted us to seize the night and ACT. This is not a protest. This is not a vigil. This is a beginning. The beginning of a movement that no politician, no foreign banker, and no journalist will understand until it is too late. There are still people in this city who are agents of the previous system, those who still are adherents to the capitalist and liberal hydra! Those reactionaries who peddle false illusions and extort common citizens for their own personal gain! You know perfectly well about whom I speak. They may be your neighbors, they may be your friends, they may even be here right now! We can't wait for the courts! WE NEED TO TAKE OUR JUSTICE.\n\nNow they roared. Now they chanted and praised the death to reactionaries. I didn't say it. They did. That mattered more. I smiled - not because I believed what I was saying, but because I knew they did. The belief was for the masses. Control was for the few. I left the stage early. Deliberately. No handshakes, no slogans. By the time I reached the car, someone threw a Molotov cocktail on the nearest building where the bank was located. And all this carried out further into the night, spreading. More fires followed - shopfronts, pharmacies, a few symbols someone had deemed \"foreign\". Graffiti bloomed like weeds: Stars of David crossed out, slogans in dripping paint. \"Time has come\" painted on every wall. Behind the crowd, sirens howled. But the militia still stood down the road, unmoving. Their orders were simple: Let them scream. I had whispered those words myself. When I returned to my office, I knew what the country would say. But the people watching at home - angry, poor, abandoned - would see something else. Order. Strength. Fire in the night. Yet, I couldn't help but wonder - did I build something that could be controlled? "

dgr.30.t: "The Young Guard"
dgr.30.desc: "- Gentlemen, let's count the votes. First, let's decide which branch of the military will be the most important.\nAleksander Bargieła and his loyal officers were deep in heated debate about the future of the National People's Army. Now that they effectively had free rein, they could begin reshaping and expanding it according to their vision. And their ambitions were grand.\n- I don't know why we're even debating this. Ground forces - how are we supposed to win anything without investing in infantry? - said General Abrahamowicz. - Rifle in hand and for the motherland!\n- What a bold plan - just throw bodies at the problem. No, we need tanks! Armored vehicles, trucks! We've got to fire up the industrial engine, and then we'll crush everyone with the power of steel! - argued General Szarejko, who had recently taken on the role of commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Bargieła was convinced these \"consultations\" were only necessary so his subordinates could cling to the illusion that their voices mattered and that they had some influence.\n- Excuse me, but this is the 21st century. We've got an airport in Pyrzowice. We've got steelworks. We've got strategic analyses. Why the hell should we be sending our soldiers to the front at all? We bomb them with artillery, drones, and planes while we warm our asses in a Czech bar sipping beer. And if we need to, we clean up with a commando drop - said Zimmermann, who was always fascinated by overwhelming firepower and action-movie-style operations.\n- Building aircraft isn't exactly easy, but yes, we need to invest in drones. That said, we should also move with the times and fund our secret weapons sector - alternative energy, lasers, robotics - chimed in Czyżewski, the eternal proponent of miracle technologies that were sure to revolutionize the battlefield... if they weren't utterly useless money pits.\n- Sure, go to Katowice and you'll find UFOs too. And where exactly are we supposed to get labs for this kind of research? You think they'll build you lasers in Sztygarka? - snapped Abrahamowicz.\nThe discussion quickly devolved into a competition of who could outbid the others with bigger dreams. Bargieła's expression evolved from bored to irritated. If one more person dared to bring up...\n- We could just as well invest in a navy!\n- Where the hell do you want me to launch it, Pogoria Lake?! - Bargieła snapped. - Next, you'll tell me we should build a nuclear bomb and be done with it!\n- Because we should...\nAt that, Aleksander slammed his fist on the table. With a forced smile, he declared the session over, thanking everyone for their time and the \"productive exchange of ideas.\"\nAs the officers filed out, you could still hear them restarting their debate over their next brilliant ideas. The worst part? Abrahamowicz had actually been the closest to the truth. In their current state, the only thing they could realistically rely on was a mass infantry assault. Building hundreds of tanks wasn't the real problem. The real challenge was fuel. And that, no matter how grand their war machine, was something they couldn't overcome."

dgr.31.t: "The Angry and the Senile"
dgr.31.desc: "The entire country feared this meeting. The National People's Army, under the sole and undisputed leadership of Aleksander Bargieła, had grown to massive proportions. At this point, it was the military that effectively dictated the direction of the nation's political and economic development. The population was either fanatically devoted to the national-populist vision or paralyzed by fear of the militias. Szwej, back during the first Working Class Unity Congress, had still been able to keep the increasingly fascist-leaning Bargieła on a tight leash. But age had left its mark on the First Secretary, and creeping dementia - clumsily concealed - meant that the army commander had begun to smell blood. The Secretary was, at times, unable to maintain contact with reality, and these episodes were becoming more frequent. Outside of them, however, he could still rule with an iron hand.\n- Comrade General, thank you for coming. I'm hearing troubling reports that there's an atmosphere of fear in the streets - fear of your army thugs. I suggest you get your goons under control, or the people's commissars will have to conduct a thorough audit. A very personal one.\nThe general didn't like that. He had decided the time had come to drop the mask.\n- I don't give a fuck about your commissars or your whole fucking politburo.\nSzwej was genuinely taken aback, despite months of warnings from his ministers about potential reactionary moves from the military. If only he could remember what they had told him...\n- Your circus of impostors only exists because I carry it on my back. Through force of arms. We're the ones who conquered all this. We seized it by force while you were hiding in your offices pretending to be one with the people. I built power. And you must be out of your fucking mind if you think I'll let you piss away this opportunity.\nBargieła was relentless in his rant. For a brief moment, it looked like Szwej was resetting.\n- Who are you? - he muttered\nGeneral was flabbergasted. He didn't know if that was actual dementia kicking in, or was it just Szwej despising him. Then, the anger came. A deluge of fury held for so long.\n- You god-damn commie fool! I'll fucking show you who I am! - Bargieła said angrily and shoved the First Secretary so hard he fell. And that was very unfortunate, as Szwej was falling he hit his head on the table. He was unconscious, and one of his eyes was all bloodied. Bargieła stared at him calmly as he enjoyed it, but then his instincts came back. He forced himself to fake a panic attack and yelled.\n- HEEEEEELP! I NEED SOME HELP HERE, BRING A MEDIC!\nTwo guards ran into the room and saw Bargieła kneeling beside their leader while holding his head. No one had the time or guts to question what had happened. A team of doctors quickly came and took Szwej to the hospital. Guards stayed in that room and looked at Bargieła as if they were waiting for something. One of them finally spoke."

People often came up to him to thank him for his service. He cherished those small moments of appreciation, even if they sting - they were a constant reminder of his powerlessness. He longed for more agency.\n*Puff*\nWith each new joint, his mind drifted off to dreams of what his perfect world would look like. He thought of things that made all other problems seem small. Peace across all of Poland, a land where everyone was happy, where the country became a paradise and people stopped tearing each other apart. That line might have been in one of his songs. He wondered if he should write something. He had so many ideas. But no, not an album. He needed to write a manifesto. And some acts.\n*Puff*\nHe appreciated these short, fleeting moments and the scent of the surrounding forest. A beautiful harmony with nature. Every day was a gift, and the belief that nothing here was meaningless pushed him forward, day after day.

He knew it, every time he looked at the faces of those passing through Zielona Camp. They wanted freedom.\n*Puff*\nBut the army was terrifyingly strong. It was trying to lock people into cages inside their own minds. The nest has to be burned. The heart of Babylon has to be set on fire!

Tired of factional bickering, tired of austerity, tired of whispers in the corridors and bodies in the rivers. They had gathered to discuss the budget. What they got instead was Damian Krępa aka Bas Tajpan. He stood at the podium like a conjurer preparing his trick. Immaculate suit. Perfectly timed silence. Then, a slight clearing of the throat - and a bomb dropped.\n- Comrades, I have three simple wishes. Nothing more.\nA low hum rolled through the chamber. Bargieła sat forward, jaw tight, eyes narrowed. The general had little patience for Krępa's theatrics.\n- One. The full legalization of cannabis for private use. Two. The right to utilize cannabis commercially - for cultivation, distribution, and export. Three. Direct state funding for medical marijuana research and subsidies for its therapeutic use.\nThe room froze.\n- These - Tajpan continued, eyes scanning the assembly like a hawk - are not proposals. They are conditions. We all know that marihuana never killed anyone, and it's still forbidden. If we are to enter a new era, we must change. Communism must change. Those are your words, Comrade Secretary. We must adapt to the new realities. And we're way behind on this.\nBargieła exploded.\n- You smug little fucker - he growled, fists slamming the table. - You want to turn our state into a junkie's paradise? While our boys die on the border? While we bury patriots? THIS IS YOUR PRIORITY?\nKrępa didn't flinch. He just smiled like he knew something no one else did. Bargieła was a brute, but he could be outmaneuvered. With small details, he would never expect to matter.\nSzwej, meanwhile, was quiet. Leaning back, eyes half-closed, the shadow of a smirk playing on his lips. He didn't speak - he calculated. It could be an opportunity. He was diminished, fragile, his mind adrift in foggy tunnels of memory. But when Krępa said medical marijuana, a spark lit in his eyes. Perhaps... Perhaps something could be done about the confusion. The shaking hands. The forgetfulness.\n- How effective... is it for neurological decline? - he asked, voice thin but clear.\nKrępa turned to him with the gentleness of a man offering medicine to the dying.\n- There is promising data, Comrade Secretary. And I would be honored to arrange a trial regimen.\nBargieła nearly jumped from his seat.\n- You would dare poison him?! He's not your experiment!\nBut Szwej raised a trembling hand.\n- Let him speak.\nAnd in that moment, with one old man's fragile curiosity, the tide began to turn. Damian smiled. His trick had worked.

They'd come because it was too cold at home and too loud in their heads. And now they were out of vodka, there was nothing left to say.\n- So what, boys? - burred Waldek, the oldest one in the shift - We go back to the line and pretend this isn't all a fucking joke?\nNo one answered.\nOutside, the morning shift was already gathering. Władek lit a cigarette with trembling fingers. His hands, once strong enough to carry molten steel, now trembled like a leaf in the wind.\n- Did you hear? - muttered young Romek. - That rasta clown got his weed thing passed. Legal now, supposedly.\nSomeone snorted.\n- Yeah, sure. They give us pot while we starve. \"Relax, comrade, your children won't feel hunger if you're stoned enough.\"\nLaughter. Bitter, joyless.\n- Fuck their weed. I want meat in my fridge and heat in the pipes.\n- And pay that keeps up with the prices.\n- You mean like, any fucking pay?\nThey all nodded. Slowly. Like men trying to convince themselves they still had spines.\n- We could... do it, you know - said Jerzy quietly.\nThey looked at him.\n- A committee. Like the old days. Just us, nothing fancy. We put out a note, we tell the others: we're done. No more work until someone listens.\n- They'll fire us.\n- Worse. They'll fire at us.\nJerzy nodded. - Maybe. But we're dying on our feet anyway. One week it's no overtime. Next week they \"delay\" wages. Now they talk about closing the furnace for \"ecological review.\" We wait long enough, and they'll sell the damn place for scrap. They sat with it. The fear. The weight. Then Waldek stood. He was missing two fingers from a press that hadn't been repaired since the Fall. He walked over to the rusting cabinet and tore a paper calendar from the wall. Flipped it over. Slammed it down.\n- Write the names.\nOne by one, they scrawled them. By noon, the gates of the Zawiercie Steelworks were still not open. Machines were cold. Smoke did not rise.

He had his eyes on a promotion, one that would finally elevate him within the Party ranks. Sławomir was an ambitious man, and being stuck in godforsaken Częstochowa felt beneath him. He was tired of the place, its people, and its dull routines. Worse still, rumours of spreading strikes had begun to reach his ears, unsettling news that threatened to shatter the fragile order he so carefully maintained in his smelter. \n\nKrzeszowski's daydreaming was shattered by the sudden crash of the office door swinging open. A dozen workers stormed into the room, with their faces grim and resolute, they formed a silent wall before their superior.\n- What are you doing here, dogs? - the commissar barked. - Get back to work. Now!\nBut no one moved to obey. Without a word, two men grabbed him by the arms and pulled him up from his chair. Panic flashed across Sławomir's face.\n- What the fuck are you doing?! Let go of me! Stop it, now! - he shouted, thrashing against their grip. The others had already flung the window open. When the cold air rushed into the office, Sławomir saw what they were planning. His bravado quickly collapsed into raw fear.\n- Help! Somebody, HELP! - he screamed.\nOne of the workers leaned in, his voice low and steady.\n- The time for negotiations and peaceful strikes is over, you piece of shit.\nAnd with that, they threw him out the window. When the dull thud echoed from the pavement below, the workers erupted in cheers. For too long, he had ignored their voices. While Krzeszowski sat in his air-conditioned office, scribbling reports and toasting with Party officials, they toiled in heat and smoke, working harder each day to feed the endless demands of the communist machine. And still, they had nothing. Even vodka had become a semi-luxury. Their anger had simmered long enough. Now, it boiled over. The action was harsh, yes - but necessary. The smelter was theirs now, as it always should have been. They set up barricades, sealing themselves inside and cutting off completely from the outside world. Yet they knew it could not last. Many of them had heard the stories from their fathers and grandfathers - men who had once dared to rise, only to be crushed beneath the boots of soldiers and the treads of tanks. It never ended well. Eventually, they would come again - with weapons, with armored vehicles, with orders to make an example. To destroy. To kill.\n\nAnd still, the workers stayed.\nThey ate what little they had left and passed bottles of vodka between them like communion. Not one man spoke of surrender. Not one stepped back. They knew how it would end. They waited not for mercy, but for memory. If nothing else, someone would remember that, for a brief moment, the smelter belonged to those who bled for it."

From all corners of Dąbrowa, they poured into the square like a tide - old men leaning on canes, young people full of passion, workers with red scarves tied around their necks. A sea of people standing beneath grey skies and cracked balconies, where rust clung to every iron rail like memory. It wasn't any military parade, nor a political gathering. It was a spontaneous protest against the party's tyranny. They were pushed very hard to finally go out on the streets, almost like the regime was making their life miserable on purpose. \n\nThey stood quietly at first. Some tried to yell anti-communist slogans. Then, a murmur. Soon, a melody. Low and trembling - a song from the time before the Fall - from when Poland still dreamed. It grew louder, braver. A thousand voices finding harmony with hands linked and eyes lifted up. They all looked at him, where above them all, on the balcony of PKZ, stood Aleksander Bargieła. He didn't hesitate to look with disdain at all of those little ants. Because it was his plan all along. Make them believe they're close to victory, as they would only need to break into the palace and destroy them all. Pity, they never stood a chance. \n\nAs the square filled up, only Bargieła could clearly see that they were now entrapped. Troops were now behind the protesters, blocking every possible exit. Bargieła picked up his radio, and almost hissed like a snake.\n- Proceed\n\nFrom the palace's gates, two militia units emerged with riot shields and heavy equipment. They were meticulously selected. Most fresh grunts in the force, eager to show their merit. Militiamen began walking directly into the heart of the crowd. The people tried to make room. Some did not. Shouting started. Then fists. Then rocks. One protester was thrown to the pavement. His blood soaked into the flag he'd carried like it was always meant to. Screams rose. The song fractured.\nThen - a shot.\nIt came from the rooftop of an abandoned bookstore, where a sniper lay hidden in scaffolding. He fired once - a clean kill. A militiaman, struck through the neck, collapsed like a dropped puppet.\n\nNo one even knew that this was a friendly fire. Army casualties were agreed upon weeks ago by Bargieła's inner circle.

From the south end, bricks were hurled. Someone lit a flare. A barricade of crates and banners went up in flames. Protesters struck back. Bottles, fists, batons. No one knew who was the enemy anymore. They were too many, too loud, too terrified.\n\nBargieła watched in silence. It was one thing, devising this atrocity in the safety of his office, and another - seeing this with his own eyes. This devilry. This madness. And he wasn't even finished.\n- They're scattering, comrade general - an aide whispered. - We can pull them back now.\nHe turned slowly, with his sight never leaving the carnage.\n- No. Bring in the tanks.\nA pause.\n- But comrade general, with that density of civilians-\n- Do it.\n\nFrom the far street the whole column roared like iron beasts awakening from their slumber ready to hunt.

They simply moved forward. And forward. Over toppled stands. Over banners. Over bodies. The square screamed in unison as the ground bled. The song was shattered.

And from the balcony, Bargieła turned, lighting a cigarette with shaking fingers he would never admit were shaking.\n\nIt was a point of no return. Power doesn't panic. And yet, they've just killed several hundred innocent people just to shut them up. Their need for control is so desperate, because it has just become unnatural. It requires constant effort. Oppression is the mask of fear. Bargieła knew that. And he feared that one thing that may break this siege. But for now, he stood on the ashes of a hundred souls and he didn't ask any questions. Because he was the one that mastered the final answer:"

dgr.37.t: "Lion's Paw"
dgr.37.desc: "It started like any other evening in Zielona: smoke from the grills, smoke from the joints, people lounging in patched-up chairs and old military blankets. But the air felt sharp like something had stirred under the city and begun crawling toward the surface.\nI came for the music if I'm honest. Not politics. Not the speeches. Just the rhythm, the fire in the belly you get when Bas Tajpan steps on stage with his hoodie pulled over his dreads like a priest going to war. But this time, something was different. First track - \"Kłamstwo Powtórzone Tysiąc Razy\". And we all knew something was off. That was a diss song against most of the current politburo. Everyone instantly realized we weren't here for a chill evening.\n- They will not give you freedom - he said after the first track - You must take it.\nAfter each song, he spoke. Not filler. Not slogans. Stories. Of miners fired for asking questions. Of boys arrested for spray-painting slogans. Of old women fined for hanging laundry in the wrong color.\n- My brothers and sisters! The System is a tower built on your broken backs. Babylon once again declined your rights! No legalization, no freedom, no food! RELEASE YOURSELVES FROM THE CHAINS OF OPPRESSION! THIS, THIS IS MY PARTY ID. I'M FREEING MYSELF WITH THIS ACT.\nHe threw the document into the flaming barrel on the stage. More rusted barrels were rolled in front of the stage. People gathered around, holding documents. IDs, work permits, eviction orders, ration cards. One by one, they tossed them into the fire. Crack. Snap. The pages curled like worms. I threw in my old security pass from Dzierżyński Steelworks. I watched it melt and felt clean, renewed. Another song - \"Nowy Protest\". Classic one, but still relevant. Everyone chanted. Next came the effigies. Someone brought wolly puppets of the army generals. Their faces were grotesquely painted - Bargieła with blood on his mouth, Szarejko holding a club. We carried them like traitors through the crowd, then tossed them in too. Fire danced in their eyes.\nBas stepped forward, eyes burning brighter than the fires dancing before him.\n- This is the moment. I have waited. We have no leaders. We are the leaders. We have no army. We are the army. We will not beg for rights. We will not vote for justice. We will march, and we will take it. From the earth. From the Party. From the fuckers behind their marble desks. We need to form a unified front! Slavic! Rastafari! People's! But overall, all those who cherish values like freedom, equality, justice! Babylon sits on our shoulders brothers and sisters! Tonight! Tonight I invoke a new protest. Tonight, we will bring down the Babel Tower!\nHe raised his arms.\n- WE NEED TO MARCH! WE NEED TO GATHER EVERY FREEDOM-LOVING CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY TO MARCH ON THE PALACE OF CULTURE. I WILL SEE YOU THERE. FIRE WILL RAIN DOWN UPON THE AGENTS OF EVIL!\nAnd just like that, we moved. There was no order, no strategy. I remember the sound. No shouting, no chanting. Drumming. On buckets, on signs, on the walls of tenements. Drumming that will wake up everyone in this country with vengeance."

dgr.38.t: "Babylon's Ashes"
dgr.38.desc: "I woke up with the conviction that something ended today. The Politburo fled to Częstochowa, the army has been scattered across strategic points in the country. The militias have been pushed into a defensive, assaulted by bandits and reactionaries. Only a handful of them remain now in the Palace of Culture. In this ivory tower of communist lies where I find myself. Outside the building, for the past few days, there's been a strike concert by Bas Tajpan, drawing crowds of the worst sort there to spew heresies. I tried to carve myself some escape route, but the Palace is surrounded.\n\nThe emergency security line doesn't work. Satellite radio offers only silence. They've left me here - meat for the starving horde of barbarians. In my head, I hear nothing but drums. The sound of those hellish instruments echoes between the walls and columns, cutting into the deepest corners of the mind. Drums. Drums in the dark. A sound so primitive that, for the first time in a long time, I felt fear. There's something primal in it. In knowing that no matter what you do - you're doomed to an end. But you don't know when it will come.\n\nEvery passage is barricaded. The screams start again. I've grown used to them. But there are more now. I draw back the curtains at the window. He who can master the masses can lead the whole nation into paradise. I had that chance. I had that vision. And only now do I see I was the one being used. There's no one left who calls me friend. But in the distance, on the platform used for the concerts, I spot one such person. Commissar Zimmermann. They've just thrown him onto the pyre. And lit it. Stone-faced, I watch as the flames consume him whole. So that's how I'll go. Fire.\n\nFrom dust we came, and to dust we shall return. I feel the heat. My uniform suddenly feels too tight. No - it's not that. The air is changing. Smoke. Then - a gunshot. Someone opened fire. We don't have enough ammunition for every one of these animals. The crowd crashes through the main gates like a beast without form. Bas Tajpan still stands on stage, mic in hand, rallying them with every word. Maybe I could shoot him with my pistol. I can make that shot. A final act of a failed rebellion. Burn the Babylon? Then let's burn it. Let the fire consume us all. I hear more gunfire. This time, on my floor. I hear them - laughing as they kill. I never laughed at the ones I had to eliminate. Yes, I'm afraid. Of course I am. Is it my fault? Would things have been different if that one person had stayed with me? Irrelevant.\nI raise the pistol. Safety's off. Final act. Self-immolation. Forward, into the dark.\n- Old friend, I'm coming to you.\nThe last shot rang out just as the office door burst open.\n\nLying on the floor was the corpse of the man who, just this morning, still held himself above every person in the country - General Aleksander Bargieła."

dgr.39.t: "Story of a Certain Oak"
dgr.39.desc: "Let me tell you the story of an oak. It's stood here for a thousand years. Dodging storms and axes, it's been watching us all this time. When it was young, the land around it was plowed by an old Celt. Taranis watched over it. Then came the time when a Vend stood where the Celt once did. Later, the old oak bore an icon of the Virgin Mary. And so on, and so on - just like in that song, you could keep going: The Fall came. Then the communists. Then the nationalists. Everything around the oak changed, faster and faster - but it remained sacred. Dąbrowa, after all, gets its name from this noble tree. It would be a shame to let that beautiful city be defiled.\n\nBabylon of Dąbrowa has been dismantled. The power of majesty triumphed in our city. People are celebrating, and I'm sitting alone in City Hall. And that, honestly, is the biggest problem. Revolution is always a simple, tempting concept - but what if we win? There are no structures. No state apparatus. There is only anarchy. The army has lost its generals - but it still has officers. What's left of the government has fled to Częstochowa, and who knows if the green wave will reach them there? So far, more cities are joining our front - but there will be resistance. There will be blood.\n\nEven Dąbrowa won't be spared. Inadvertently, we've unleashed the cerberus of crime once more from its depths. Until now, it tore through the nationalist militias. But when it runs out of enemies... I thought I was two steps ahead of Bargieła. But in the end, he might be the one laughing last. Or maybe not. I have friends everywhere. They'll answer the call - I declared war on Babylon itself. Old connections. Blood ties. Loyal fans. Above all: a strong message. One of freedom and liberation. That will draw people from all across Poland, and persuade those who need persuading right now.\n\nI've always believed in free will. Every day I fought, with hope, for a better tomorrow... and yet I'm a little surprised to find myself here. Fate is a cruel whore. But at least I'm free - free as a bird. I should write down where I'm heading. Because, honestly, I haven't told anyone what ideology I stand for. I've got ideals. Ideas. Principles. But I wouldn't say they fit into any existing archetype. Slavic identity. Remembrance of ancestors and roots. Rastafari. Moral values and ideals. Socialism - the righteous pursuit of justice, but only if it's done right. Can something be built out of that? Lego blocks were simpler..."

dgr.40.t: "Black Friday"
dgr.40.desc: "The boy pushed the buttons on the TV pilot. The screen blinked to life with static. Then, a face - not a cartoon rabbit, not the colorful intro he waited for every morning. A man in uniform stared back. Stone-faced. Behind him, a red-and-black flag. Words began pouring from his mouth. Serious ones. Flat. Heavy.\n- Mama? - he called. - The cartoons are gone.\nNo answer. He stepped to the balcony. Pulled open the door. Cold air hit his face. Down below, tanks. Dark, rusty and slow, crawling along the main road like elephants in armor. Soldiers, too. Rifles. Helmets. Serious faces. They were quiet, but moved like they knew where they were going.\n- Mama!\nShe came, wiping her hands on a towel.\n- What is it? - he pointed, wordless. She stepped out. One look, and the towel fell from her fingers.\n- Oh no...\nHe looked up at her.\n- Are they going to war?\n- No.\n- Then why are there tanks?\nShe didn't answer. She went inside. Picked up the phone. Dialed. Waited. Nothing. Dialed again. Still nothing.\n- Come on, come on, pick up. Please, pick up.\nThe line clicked. Silence. She tried again. Still nothing. She didn't look at his child.\n- Get dressed.\n- Why?\n- You're going to grandma's.\n- Why?\n- Because I need to get your father.\n- But you said it's not war.\n- It's not. Just get your jacket.\nHe went. Slowly. Still watching her from the hallway. She tried once more. One final number. Still no voice on the other end. Just the faint hum of the line. She packed some clothes. Pulled the boots tight. He fidgeted.\n- Will I come back home today?\n- I don't know.\nShe kissed his forehead. He could feel her breath shaking. At grandma's, she didn't stay. Didn't drink tea. Didn't explain. She just handed him off, kissed him once more, and turned back to the road. The last he saw was her silhouette, coat open, hair caught in the wind, walking straight into the noise. Toward the smoke, the metal, the shouting soldiers, and the sound of engines roaring through the spine of the city. She didn't wait for permission. She didn't wait for fear to pass. She just walked."

dgr.1001.desc: "With great pride and unwavering revolutionary spirit, we mark the triumphant conclusion of the 7th Five-Year Plan in our country - the beating industrial and socialist heart of Poland.\n\n1. Within the first 24 months, 17 major facilities were nationalised, over 21,300 workers were transferred into state syndicates. Private ownership in core sectors dropped to below 2.1%.\n2. 312 km of paved roads laid - notably the ZP-7 arterial route linking Żarki, Łazy, and Sławków. 11 new logistics hubs were constructed (e.g., Katowice Steelworks Node), and 28 bridges were rebuilt or reinforced. 46% increase in public freight capacity reported across the region.\n3. 14,800 hectares consolidated across the gminas of Kroczyce, Klucze, and Siewierz. NGR Rudniki now delivers 12,000 tonnes of grain yearly. Tractor density increased to 1 per 21 ha. Over 3,200 farmers integrated into state employment structures.\n4. 12 schools opened (e.g., People's Technical School No. 3 in Olkusz), 5 correctional-labor centers built (largest in Jaworzno - Jeziorki), 8 polyclinics operational by mid-plan, 4 new factories employing over 870 workers.\n5. Only 19% of the targeted 18,000 prefab units were completed. Major sites in Czeladź and Sosnowiec left unfinished due to material shortages and \"construction miscoordination\".\n6. Pilot attempts in collectivisation of northern counties of our country met resistance. Mass withdrawals, tool thefts, and rural non-compliance halted the program at stage 1B.\n\nDespite difficulties, 78% of plan goals were achieved, and productivity levels were noticeably raised in overall 146%! This may be good for any other socialist country, but it's not good enough for the National People's Republic! We need to pump those numbers up!"

dgr.1002.desc: "Once again, the noble cause of the people has been struck by the shadowy hand of reaction. Our socialist housing initiative - a shining example of equality and progress - was forged in the fires of solidarity. We built homes not for profit, but for dignity. We offered shelter not as commodity, but as a right. And yet, as always, the enemies of the people lurked in the rubble of the old world, waiting. These economic vultures - landlords, speculators, and profit-chasers - could not bear to see roofs given freely to workers. They whispered sabotage into the very foundation of our plans. Where we laid bricks, they planted lies. Where we regulated, they hoarded. When the state fixed rent to fair levels, they cried \"collapse\" - and then ensured it by withdrawing labor, siphoning materials, and corrupting supply chains.\n\nIt was not the wisdom of our planning that failed, but the treachery of those who refuse to accept a world without exploitation. The recent turmoil in the housing market is no accident. It is a deliberate campaign to destabilize the People's Republic. But let this be known: we will not yield. The Party and the State will respond. Profiteers will face the full force of revolutionary justice. The black market of shelter will be broken. New housing projects, under tighter supervision and with deeper ideological training for all workers involved, will rise stronger and purer than before. Let no comrade be misled by the lies of the class enemy! The crisis is not of socialism  -  it is of sabotage! And sabotage will not be tolerated!"

dgr.1003.desc: "===========Issued by the Department of Agrarian Unity===========\n\nThe road to progress is never without its obstacles. As the People's Republic boldly undertook the historic transformation of private land into collective prosperity, dark forces emerged from the countryside - forces still chained to the egoism of property and the poison of petty ownership. The collectivisation initiative, designed to lift the peasantry from the mud of feudal habit and into the light of socialist modernity, was met not with gratitude, but with resistance. Some villagers - stirred by reactionary whispers and poisoned traditions - refused to till for the common good. Tractors were sabotaged. Officials were obstructed. Grain was hoarded, tools hidden, and records falsified.\n\nThis is not struggle - this is sabotage. Let us be clear: the principle of collectivisation remains untouched, sacred, and eternal. It is the only true path toward an agrarian society free of exploitation. However, in the spirit of dialectical flexibility and temporary tactical retreat, the Central Committee has resolved to pause the implementation of full collectivisation in certain districts.\n\nThis is not a surrender, but a strategic recalibration.\n\nThe people must be re-educated. Trust must be rebuilt. The countryside must be made ready - not only in tools, but in spirit. In time, the hesitant will understand what their obstinance delayed: prosperity, equality, and mechanised abundance for all. Let the exploiters and their foreign-backed lies take no comfort. This retreat is temporary. The revolution never stops - it only changes its stride. Collectivisation delayed is not collectivisation denied. And the land, as always, belongs to the people."

Surrounded by far more powerful enemies, it miraculously held on, and thanks to the Katowice Steelworks and utilizing the power of its industry, it prevailed against the early onslaught, eventually conquering Jura.\nThe strange combination of communism and nationalism has so far proved to be stable and effective enough. It is not entirely clear what the relations between the state's individual factions are, but taking into account their morale - we cannot count on an imminent end to this pact of two devils.\n\nThe People's Front of Zagłębie now has at its disposal the untamed industrial power of the Dąbrowa Basin.

Fire blazes from the furnaces once more, along with the spirit of communism aided by nationalist rhetoric.\n\nHowever, reports emerge of a spike in internal disputes, as not all communists wish to adhere to the bloody ideological legacy of Mieczysław Moczar, and even fewer nationalists want to continue to cooperate with those advocating for the same communist ideology that enslaved the country for nearly 50 years.

Reports suggest that the main topic of discussion was the formalization of the alliance and the prospect of potential centralization. However, it remains unclear what level of unification is actually on the table at this stage. Doubts persist regarding the true intentions of the remaining participants - are they genuinely willing to risk handing over power to Czarzasty, or will they fight to protect their own interests? One thing is certain: other states in the region must now contend with the unified forces of the Intercounty, which appears to have become a single, solid block.

Each member state issued declarations blaming everyone else for the problems that arose between them, and military forces were placed on high alert.

However, it's far from an effective occupation - more a series of sporadic black terror campaigns carried out by Antifa militias. This stems from the nature of the Jaworzno regime's system - or rather, the lack thereof. The regime embraces maximum decentralization and structural chaos, which has proven nearly impossible to export to the resistant populations of Mysłowice and Lędziny. The local backlash culminated in the formation of the Sabotagereferat Myslovitz, a group widely believed to be funded from Berlin. Now, tensions have reached a boiling point: the group has declared that armed resistance is the only way left to repel Antifa terror.
