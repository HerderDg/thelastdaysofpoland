 DGR_euroterminal: "Euroterminal Sławków"
 DGR_mr_hamburger: "Comrade Hamburger"
 DGR_dzafar: "Dżafar Kebab"
 DGR_separatists: "Separatists"
 DGR_separatists_desc: "Dąbrowa was a largest city in its voivodeship (by area) for a reason. And of course it led to rise of few separatist movement which think their several wooden shack should be called separate city and not the district of a larger entity."
 DGR_druglords: "Drug Lords"
 DGR_druglords_desc: "One of many disadvantages of a city life is easy access to everything that's banned. And in such environments - drug lords thrive. Not only that, but they seem to be now major players in struggle to control the city."
 DGR_rastafari: "Zielona Camp"
 DGR_rastafari_desc: "There are not many things worse than Polish reggae, and here in Zielona, it looks like time has stopped, and Fall never happened. What's happening here is an eternal Woodstock with a bunch of weed."
 DGR_pharaohs: "Pharaohs Gang" 
 DGR_pharaohs_desc: "Błędów Desert has become a home for baked out of their minds criminals. They are addicted to some new, unknown to us drug. But overall, they're waiting for their messiah. Good for them." 

 DGR_industrial_heart1: "Industrial Heart - Cardiac Arrest"
 DGR_industrial_heart2: "Industrial Heart - Resuscitation"
 DGR_industrial_heart3: "Industrial Heart - Resuscitation"
 DGR_industrial_heart4: "Industrial Heart - Life Support"
 DGR_industrial_heart5: "Industrial Heart of Zagłębie"
 DGR_industrial_heart1_desc: "The industrial might of Zagłębie was built over decades - and yet it took only a few short years of capitalist rule to reduce it all to nothingness. Mines shuttered, shafts sealed, collapsed steelworks, dismantled factories, ruined rail networks and only the wind now carries the fading echo of this region's once-proud economic achievements.\n\n§tThe industrial heart of Zagłębie lies in critical condition.§!"
 DGR_industrial_heart2_desc: "The industrial might of Zagłębie was built over decades - and yet it took only a few short years of capitalist rule to reduce it all to nothingness. Mines shuttered, shafts sealed, collapsed steelworks, dismantled factories, ruined rail networks and only the wind now carries the fading echo of this region's once-proud economic achievements.\n\n§tThe industrial heart of Zagłębie lies in critical condition - but we have the cure. And we will work ourselves to the bone.§!"
 DGR_industrial_heart3_desc: "The industrial might of Zagłębie was built over decades - and yet it took only a few short years of capitalist rule to reduce it all to nothingness. Mines shuttered, shafts sealed, collapsed steelworks, dismantled factories, ruined rail networks and only the wind now carries the fading echo of this region's once-proud economic achievements.\n\n§tThe industrial heart of Zagłębie lies in critical condition - but we have the cure. And we will work ourselves to the bone.§!"
 DGR_industrial_heart4_desc: "The industrial might of Zagłębie was built over decades - and yet it took only a few short years of capitalist rule to reduce it all to nothingness. Mines shuttered, shafts sealed, collapsed steelworks, dismantled factories, ruined rail networks and only the wind now carries the fading echo of this region's once-proud economic achievements.\nThe industrial heart of Zagłębie is slowly returning to life, but a great deal of work still lies ahead.\n§t§!"
 DGR_industrial_heart5_desc: "The industrial might of Zagłębie was built over decades - and yet it took only a few short years of capitalist rule to reduce it all to nothingness. Mines shuttered, shafts sealed, collapsed steelworks, dismantled factories, ruined rail networks and only the wind now carries the fading echo of this region's once-proud economic achievements.\n\n§GThrough the titanic effort of the entire working people, we have managed to restore a fragment of this industrial greatness - and the industrial heart beats once more with strength. And this is only the beginning!§!"
 DGR_red_heritage: "Legacy of Communism"
 DGR_red_heritage_desc: "The Red Zagłębie - a political term forged around the powerful workers' movement that emerged in this region during the industrialization of the late 19th century, carried forward by communists during the People's Republic, and standing firm to this very day. In Dąbrowa, many monuments from the communist era still stand, untouched by decommunization efforts. The legacy of Secretary Gierek, who raised this region to the rank of an industrial powerhouse, will never be forgotten."
 DGR_red_heritage2: "Rebirth of Communism"
 DGR_red_heritage2_desc: "The Red Zagłębie - a political term forged around the powerful workers' movement that emerged in this region during the industrialization of the late 19th century, carried forward by communists during the People's Republic, and standing firm to this very day. In Dąbrowa, many monuments from the communist era still stand, untouched by decommunization efforts. The legacy of Secretary Gierek, who raised this region to the rank of an industrial powerhouse, will never be forgotten."
 DGR_red_heritage3: "Communism Reforged"
 DGR_red_heritage3_desc: "The Red Zagłębie - a political term forged around the powerful workers' movement that emerged in this region during the industrialization of the late 19th century, carried forward by communists during the People's Republic, and standing firm to this very day. In Dąbrowa, many monuments from the communist era still stand, untouched by decommunization efforts. The legacy of Secretary Gierek, who raised this region to the rank of an industrial powerhouse, will never be forgotten."
 DGR_red_heritage_nazbol: "Communism Reimagined"
 DGR_red_heritage_nazbol_desc: "The Red Zagłębie - a political term forged around the powerful workers' movement that emerged in this region during the industrialization of the late 19th century, carried forward by communists during the People's Republic, and standing firm to this very day. In Dąbrowa, many monuments from the communist era still stand, untouched by decommunization efforts. The legacy of Mieczysław Moczar and Secretary Gierek, who raised this region to the rank of an industrial powerhouse, will never be forgotten."
 DGR_district_wars: "District Wars"
 DGR_district_wars_desc: "The complacent and passive policies of Marcin Bazylak meant that the Fall struck him twice - first, as it did the entire country, and then again, more profoundly, in the hearts of the people of Dąbrowa. Control over the city slipped from the president's hands, and we were cast back into a state of nature - a ceaseless war of all against all. And it is the ordinary people who suffer most from this chaos."
 DGR_district_wars2: "Criminal Hydra"
 DGR_district_wars2_desc: "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce. And our inability to rein over population of our city has led us to the brink of collapse again."
 DGR_narodowa_armia_ludowa1: "Militant Rabble"
 DGR_narodowa_armia_ludowa1_desc: "For a country that claims to take pride in its military strength, all we currently have at our disposal is a ragtag mob, half of them barely armed with whatever we could scavenge. Worse still, their commitment to the ideals represented by our party is highly questionable. And as for the officers? Half of them couldn't organize a picnic, let alone lead a functioning military unit."
 DGR_narodowa_armia_ludowa2: "Militant People's Rabble"
 DGR_narodowa_armia_ludowa2_desc: "For a country that claims to take pride in its military strength, all we currently have at our disposal is a ragtag mob, half of them barely armed with whatever we could scavenge. At least, their commitment to the ideals represented by our party has somewhat improved, and we have a core of working people units that could be our symbols. And as for the officers? Half of them still couldn't organize a picnic, but at least they could put red stars in the decorations."
 DGR_narodowa_armia_ludowa3: "National People's Paramilitary"
 DGR_narodowa_armia_ludowa3_desc: "For a country that claims to take pride in its military strength, all we currently have at our disposal is a ragtag mob, half of them barely armed with whatever we could scavenge. The second half is better, because nationalist drill is precise and organised, in opposition to our commissars. Luckily, our officers are beginning to understand their assignments. But to make them all a functioning entity...it's still a long way ahead."
 DGR_red_star_over_church: "Red Star over the Church"
 DGR_red_star_over_church_desc: "Communist states have always had a complicated relationship with the Church. But in Poland, the Catholic Church was powerful enough to overshadow socialist ideals and preserve its identity in the face of revolution - even repression could not break its influence. We must learn from the mistakes of the past and transform the Church into a vessel for spreading our ideology - one that is, in truth, not as incompatible with faith as once believed."

 DGR_5_year_plan_idea: "7th Five-Year Plan"
 DGR_5_year_plan_idea_desc: "The Five-Year Plans pulled Poland out of the darkness of postwar collapse and rebuilt our strength on the international stage. The dark era of capitalism squandered all those achievements in favor of immediate, unrestrained consumerism. We must reject the temptations of the moment and restore long-term, strategic thinking - thinking that will allow us, and above all future generations, to enjoy the true luxuries of a mighty socialist economy."

 DGR_gierek_idea: "Cult of Gierek"
 DGR_gierek_idea_desc: "If the socialist ideal were transported to ancient times, all citizens would undoubtedly proclaim Edward Gierek their leader, their Caesar - whom they would follow even into the deepest pits of hell. The well-earned reverence the First Secretary enjoys in Zagłębie is a testament to how deeply his deeds have been appreciated by the local people. And it is those very deeds that ensure everyone here is ready to answer that one famous question without hesitation: \"Yes! We will help, Comrade Secretary!\""
 DGR_moczar_idea: "Spirit of Moczar"
 DGR_moczar_idea_desc: "The spirit of Mieczysław Moczar lives on - not only in the memories of communist activists, but also in the minds of nationalist thinkers who found deep kinship with the idea of partisanship. For it is impossible to build communism without reflecting on the form it must take. And that form must be clothed in the mantle of national pride and patriotism. Only then can we, as a nation, become a true and indivisible unity."
 DGR_real_estate_crash_idea: "Real Estate Crash"
 DGR_real_estate_crash_idea_desc: "It is always the case that the noble ideals of socialism must confront the relentless efforts of economic reactionaries - those who seize every opportunity to undermine our value system. This time, the reaction has targeted our generous housing program, deliberately sabotaging it and plunging the real estate market into crisis! The state must act decisively - this kind of profiteering on the backs of ordinary people cannot be tolerated!"
 DGR_collectivisation_stage_1: "Collectivisation - Stage 1"
 DGR_collectivisation_stage_1_desc: "Collectivization in Poland was never properly completed. But to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, we will carry it out systematically, carefully, and with due respect for the people who have worked that land for generations. There are no more feudal landlords whose estates we must seize. What we must do now is rekindle the flame of cooperative spirit among the people - and from there, everything else will follow smoothly."
 DGR_collectivisation_stage_2: "Collectivisation - Stage 2"
 DGR_collectivisation_stage_2_desc: "Collectivization in Poland was never properly completed. But to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, we will carry it out systematically, carefully, and with due respect for the people who have worked that land for generations. There are no more feudal landlords whose estates we must seize. What we must do now is rekindle the flame of cooperative spirit among the people - and from there, everything else will follow smoothly.\n\n§tOr not...§!"
 DGR_strikes_1: "Local Strikes"
 DGR_strikes_1_desc: "It was to be expected - wherever progress and revolution emerge, resistance is born. But there is nothing to fear. The anti-socialist agitators will soon learn how an efficient state responds. We cannot afford to yield to the demands of the unionists. Never again."
 DGR_strikes_2: "General Strike"
 DGR_strikes_2_desc: "Strikes have now spread across most of the factories in our country, and it seems the roots of anti-socialist agitation run deeper in the people than we had anticipated. But all is not lost. We must hold our ground with unwavering resolve, so that this wind of so-called \"change\" does not sweep us from the board. We will endure - and every reactionary will receive exactly what they deserve."

 DGR_fabrykapelnazycia_gierek: "Glory of the Workers"
 DGR_fabrykapelnazycia_gierek_desc: "The alliance of the working people of the cities and the countryside is the cornerstone of the socialist idea - around them revolves the life of every properly functioning state. They are the bread and salt of this land. It is they who labor every day to provide for their families and for their nation. In gratitude for their effort, we must ensure they receive proper praise and just compensation."
 DGR_fabrykapelnazycia_gierek2: "Glory of the Workers"
 DGR_fabrykapelnazycia_gierek2_desc: "The alliance of the working people of the cities and the countryside is the cornerstone of the socialist idea - around them revolves the life of every properly functioning state. They are the bread and salt of this land. It is they who labor every day to provide for their families and for their nation. In gratitude for their effort, we must ensure they receive proper praise and just compensation."
 DGR_fabrykapelnazycia_moczar: "Pushing to the Limit"
 DGR_fabrykapelnazycia_moczar_desc: "The alliance of the working people of the cities and the countryside is the cornerstone of the socialist idea - around them revolves the life of every properly functioning state. They are the bread and salt of this land. It is they who labor every day to provide for their families and for their nation. But in times of crisis, adequate productivity must be expected. Without it, we do not only endanger ourselves - but we risk the security of the entire country, both from within and from outside. Discipline and duty are not punishments - they are the shield of the republic."
 DGR_fabrykapelnazycia_moczar2_desc: "The alliance of the working people of the cities and the countryside is the cornerstone of the socialist idea - around them revolves the life of every properly functioning state. They are the bread and salt of this land. It is they who labor every day to provide for their families and for their nation. But in times of crisis, adequate productivity must be expected. Without it, we do not only endanger ourselves - but we risk the security of the entire country, both from within and from outside. Discipline and duty are not punishments - they are the shield of the republic."
 DGR_fabrykapelnazycia_moczar2: "Pushing to the Limit"

 DGR_real_estate_idea_moczar: "Apartments for the Poorest"
 DGR_real_estate_idea_moczar_desc: "Housing is a right, not a commodity! Cries of the socialist were always shunned by failed capitalist hyenas who saw only their profit in properties. Yet every people's state must guarantee equal opportunities! And that means the poorest among us must be granted homes - not as a luxury, but as a foundation of a dignified life."
 DGR_real_estate_idea_gierek: "Prefab Blocks Deluge"
 DGR_real_estate_idea_gierek_desc: "Housing is a right, not a commodity! Cries of the socialist were always shunned by failed capitalist hyenas who saw only their profit in properties. That's why we must return to the programs of mass and cheap communal apartments. There is plenty of room in Poland to build new neighborhoods. We will all fit."
 
 DGR_unstable_district: "Unstable District"
 DGR_unstable_district_desc: "This district wasn't completely pacified and there are still some fires that we will have to put out in the future."

 DGR_central_planning_commision_desc: "Our industry has died and now it stinks. Oh, wait. It's just the standard smells coming from the steelworks. The industrial plants in the city have shut down along with the rest of the country. The decaying carcass of the Dąbrowa economy is a testament of this city itself. At least the sky has become somewhat bluer. If only people weren't dying of hunger, this might be a plus. Apparently, a Central Planning Commission has been established to revive the economic power of the heart of the Zagłębie\n\nBrick by brick, machine by machine, the spirit of people's thrift will be used to produce 200% of the norm, in exchange for hunger rations just to fuel the communists' war efforts. But soon we will be back at the top of the rankings. Of cities with the highest air pollution..."
 DGR_restore_palace_of_culture: "Restore Palace of Culture"
 DGR_restore_palace_of_culture_desc: "Zagłębie's Palace of Culture. The impaired younger brother of Warsaw's Palace of Culture, a mediocre caricature of what was supposed to be a powerful cultural symbol of the region but became just a black hole absorbing millions for renovations. Another great renovation is ahead. The communists, taking over the center, will want to complete the vision of our graciously reigning ex-president Bazylak and make the Palace of Culture a true government center.\n\nIn fact, it's not such a stupid idea. If it were transformed into a likeness of the Presidential Palace, it could serve as a strong symbol of the city's power and its reborn glory. Except that Szwej couldn't sit there... Even Jimmy Hendrix sitting next to the palace in Freedom Square can see that he's not leader material deserving of such a grand palace."
 DGR_undermine_drug_dealers: "Destroy Drug Dealing Operations"
 DGR_undermine_drug_dealers_desc: "When your family home is snatched from your hands and taken over by a gang of criminal degenerates, certain principles cease to matter. In this case, maybe the enemy of my enemy is not entirely my friend, but I can only tell them one thing - BURN THIS PLAGUE TO THE GROUND.\n\nReden is one of the districts most infected with the virus of deviant crime. Only the northern areas of Gołonóg with Spisak and Łączna streets together with Mydlice can directly compete with Reden in the category of \"districts where you don't want to live.\" I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm glad the People's Front \"liberated\" Reden, even if only temporarily. There's a fraction of hope that these areas will experience the long-awaited and deserved peace without major battles in Haller's Park or dealers from Orzeszkowa street lurking on every corner."
 DGR_raise_popular_militias: "Raise Popular Militias"
 DGR_raise_popular_militias_desc: "No one wants to die for the red dream. Volunteers here are as rare as hen's teeth, as we have learned ourselves. And what can the communists say? Like it or not, they have to start recruiting. But how? Encouraging people to flee to the Steelworks. But with what? Fruit Thursdays? A solid paycheck? Tons of crude steel from the steelworks? The communist revolution? They might try to call up the steelworkers, but there aren't many left. Their only way out will be forcibly enlisting ordinary citizens. Good luck bringing them from areas controlled by gangs. We must be doubly vigilant so that agents of the revolution don't roam our lands, stealing our people. Once upon a time, black Volgas were real boogeymen... the world has moved forward but not the communist parties. Only the car models have changed."
 DGR_przyjazn_coking_plant: "Restore 'Przyjaźń' Coking Plant"
 DGR_przyjazn_coking_plant_desc: "Once the most modern coking plant in the country. Then taken over by the bean counters of Jastrzębie Coal Company. The country has fallen, but the corporate rats still operate in the plant. Whoever takes over this area will have quite a hard nut to crack, mostly because the coking plant is in a state of decay. But if it could be restored to full functionality - it would fuel our economy immensely. Among the smoke and pyrolysis, the main foundation of the city's economy will arise. Once again. The name of it still bothers me, though."
 DGR_tucznawa_zone: "Tucznawa Investition Zone"
 DGR_tucznawa_zone_desc: "Dąbrowa is very spacious. After all, it was once the 9th largest city in Poland for a reason. But of course, Gdynia and Świnoujście claimed the sea as a city land, and we fell to 11th place. Nothing lost, this will change soon. Shipyard workers cannot compete with steelworkers. But back to the point - we have a lot of land to manage. That is why, for several years, a huge investment zone has been designated in Tucznawa to be filled with various industrial plants. These areas will be the perfect complement to the iron core of the city's economy."
 DGR_dzierzynski_steelworks: "Renovate Dzierżyński Steelworks"
 DGR_dzierzynski_steelworks_desc: "Bank Steelworks. Now it is a shithole, but under communism, it was a magnificent factory. No wonder they decided to return to its former name - Feliks Dzierżyński Steelworks. It is not as large and efficient as Katowice Steelworks, but its history dates back to the times when cannons for the January insurgents were forged there. Cieszkowski was on point with those guns. He knew how to make good use of the potential of this plant. Even the Nazis, who during the war assembled their tanks like Panthers, Tigers, and even parts for V1 and V2 rockets there, appreciated it. Interesting... maybe some archival technical documents could be found there..."
 DGR_monuments_of_old_times: "Desert Trip"
 DGR_monuments_of_old_times_desc: "Everyone really thinks that Błędów and the Błędów Desert are one and the same. The truth is, the name comes from this place, but only a small, heavily forested piece is within the city's borders. The rest is already in Lesser Poland. Fortunately, the Ziobrists don't go to the desert, so the gang called the Pharaohs operates in areas larger than any other. But it would be more than enough to drive into Błędów with an old tank for them to capitulate. I don't think they would even resist. They're just there for show, nothing more."
 DGR_rastafarian_question: "Rastafarian Question"
 DGR_rastafarian_question_desc: "Eating, drinking, smoking joints. Dancing, revelry, and frolic. And this is not a scene from Adam Mickiewicz but the situation in Zielona Park, where a real Rastafarian commune has emerged. It's hard to even call them a gang... because they just sit there and basically don't compete with anyone. Probably because they are constantly high. Plus, the blessing of People's Front Minister Damian Krępa means they enjoy government protection. They are harmless in their activities. If we leave them there, they won't even know what's going on around them. Only God knows if they are even aware that Poland no longer exists. Well, we could also just scatter them and none would be the wiser..."
 DGR_undermine_opposition: "Root Out Separatist Movements"
 DGR_undermine_opposition_desc: "Traitors, traitors, all of them traitors! Not only was Sławków once part of Dąbrowa Górnicza, but they apparently didn't like it so much that they decided to secede and join Będzin County, which they don't even border! Their impudence knows no bounds. Now, when they have once again become part of our great city - they have again caused a rift in unity and rebelled. Additionally, they have infected the residents of Strzemieszyce with their separatist virus. Every independence activist must pay for their crimes. Every whisper of freedom should be drowned in blood. Enough of the dreamers' fantasies. We are all Dąbrowians."
 DGR_every_worker_a_soldier: "Every Worker a Soldier"
 DGR_every_worker_a_soldier_desc: "Young Steelworkers. Another stain on the city map that is only suitable for disposal in the blast furnace no. 2 at the Steelworks. But apparently, according to the communists, everyone is a potential carrier of the revolution. Sounds contagious indeed. Ząbkowice has always been a hotel for workers who worked in nearby plants, and not much has changed. Only I wonder - if you call up workers as soldiers... who will work in these plants to produce equipment for the soldiers? Something doesn't add up, Comrade Szwej."
 DGR_negotiate_with_li: "Negotiate with ŁI"
 DGR_negotiate_with_li_desc: "When in fear, God is dear. The People's Front officially wants to negotiate with us. Mainly because the young squatters from Ząbkowice do not share their outdated point of view. Hell has truly frozen over. Someone trusted the horseshoe theory as the ideal way out of their problems too much. I won't say nationalism in both cases is not similar...and...no, it's a betrayal. But... maybe? Maybe this is the chance? To participate in forming a new Dąbrowian government, transforming the city in our image and likeness. We would have the opportunity to achieve the influence we originally lacked. And when the right moment comes - blow up the system from within and reign unchallenged. It is a tough nut to crack because with each passing moment, I see more and more sense in this madness. Only how to convince my people that this is the way?"
 DGR_heavy_machinery_production: "Gangers into Militias"
 DGR_heavy_machinery_production_desc: "What is the difference between a gangster and a soldier? Mainly the equipment. Well, in the case of communist militias, the only difference is that they are led by ideological officers, not the biggest thug in the neighborhood who dares to call himself the big boss. But even the best officer is useless when he has idiots from the ghetto under his command, whose only skill is to assault an old lady in a group of five. Because if someone shows up who can stand up to them, then the boys will run for the hills!\n\nThey need firm officers with an iron hand and iron will who can make men out of these gangsters. Otherwise, I don't see any grand victories for this army for quite some time."
 DGR_katowice_steelworks: "Complete Restoration of Katowice Steelworks"
 DGR_katowice_steelworks_desc: "Katowice Steelworks has transformed from a collapsing post-fall industrial plant into the center of armed revolution. Now that the whole city is relatively peaceful, this giant must be restored to its nominal processing power. The communists can leave, and the workers return to work. Furnaces and chimneys must be renovated. Rolling mills repaired. The power plant integrated into the municipal network. Conveyor belts restarted. There is much to be done to make Dąbrowa's pride the most powerful industrial plant in the country again. Exactly. Dąbrowa's. Katowice should disappear from the name. We shouldn't give the Silesians any reasons to be proud.\n\nEvery builder of the renewed Huta Katowice will be a pioneer of success. But to achieve this... SHUT UP AND WORK OVERTIME!"
 DGR_our_position: "Our Position in Dąbrowa Basin"
 DGR_our_position_desc: "Bazylak got us into this sick alliance. Come on, Marcin - it's going to fucking explode. If leftists hate anything more than rightists, it's other leftists whose ideology differs even a little. Antifa, socialists, communists, anarchists. Only one of these ideas will ultimately triumph, and the rest will have to be turned to dust. Not to mention that there are other nationalists in the north. And Ziobro, even though he got hit in his balls once and has his own problems now, he still remains an unpredictable entity. We can only rely on ourselves. Which is ironic because I can't even trust other members of the government. But we play with the cards we've been dealt."
 DGR_nationalist_communist_paramilitary: "Natonalist-Communist Paramilitary"
 DGR_nationalist_communist_paramilitary_desc: "It happened. The official signing of the nationalist-communist alliance. Our units will maintain complete autonomy within the newly created National People's Army. Szwej turned out to be weak, agreeing to most of our demands. Normally I would see this as a trick or a stratagem, but I can recognize when someone has insincere intentions. Here, all I saw was desperation. Democrats will not follow the old order. The modern left won't either. This city is thoroughly sick. And we are the only cure.\n\nNow everyone will know the price of messing with us. Our stark resolve will revive the spirit of Dąbrowian people thanks to our methods. Soon enough we shall be in charge of the whole National People's Army. Oh, how they will all weep then. Political ideology won't matter when you have the strength of a grand army to back you up."
 DGR_congress_of_bedzin: "Congress of Będzin"
 DGR_congress_of_bedzin_desc: "What I feared may come to pass sooner than I expected. The second Congress of Intercounty will take place in Będzin. Everyone will be there with their most important dignitaries. I will not be sidelined, I must have a place in the Dąbrowian delegation. Not that I plan something very funny. But I would very much like to see the faces of Czarzasty, Żukowska, and Konieczny when they realize who is sitting on the other side of the table. Although on the other hand, 50 hours of boring bullshit containing the imperative of equality and the socialist idea makes me nauseous already. If the Intercounty somehow survives, we must take as much as possible for ourselves. \n\nIf not... good riddance."
 DGR_industrial_heart: "Industrial Heart of Zagłębie"
 DGR_industrial_heart_desc: "Finally, all elements of the industrial puzzle have been united into one steel fist. The reborn heart of Zagłębie beats to the rhythm of progress. Among machines, smoke, and steel, the entire economic power of Dąbrowa Górnicza works for the benefit of the nation. The Dąbrowian nation. We are the custodians of industrialization and pioneers of the revolution. This force cannot be stopped anymore. With each successive completed workers' plan, the army and society grow in wealth.\n\nNow we must focus all our productive power on one goal. War is coming. The lightning is red, the hammer will forge an iron sword. The National People's Army is the child of the power of Dąbrowa's heavy industry. And thanks to these plants, the rest of Poland will feel what Zagłębie Dąbrowskie is capable of."
 DGR_aftermath: "Aftermath"
 DGR_aftermath_desc: "I can't say that I did not expect this. However, the intensity of the socialist outcry that took place in the final hours of the congress in Będzin exceeded my wildest expectations. Traitors of the revolution, Nazis in red robes, sellouts, brown fascists, useful PiS idiots, volksdeutsche, smiling clowns. The list of invectives that all sides threw at each other was enormous. And all this in a few minutes during the last meeting. We were on the verge of an agreement. We were this close. But the masks finally fell off, and no one hid the fact that we despise each other.\n\nIntercounty is a dead corpse on which crows and ravens will feed. The time of war conflagration has come. There is no turning back from this path. Time for action."
 DGR_glory_parade: "Rose Alley Parade"
 DGR_glory_parade_desc: "Our combat value may be negligible, but at least we can march proudly. This is also a symbol of hope for the city's population. Hope that there finally exists a formation that will defend their lives. Even if in its ranks are those who not long ago would gladly take that life from them. Never mind. Guarded by disciplined officers, the soldiers will be obedient because that is the only thing they are morally capable of. You only need to be more menacing than their previous gang leaders; the mere power of authority will do the rest. Such a mixture, seasoned with the latest military vehicles freshly released by the Dąbrowa steel mills, will march today along Rose Alley towards the city center to pledge loyalty to the People's Front in front of the Palace of Culture. If only these idiots do not trip over their own feet."
 DGR_working_people: "For the Working People!"
 DGR_working_people_desc: "I never thought I would ever be an advocate of working-class pride. But at a time when it is so closely intertwined with the military and nationalist spirit, I am able to undertake a few rhetorical liberties. Whatever one might say about the communists - the working class must be properly nurtured because it constitutes the core of every well-functioning state. And we fight for a better tomorrow especially for them. Because if the working class is taken care of, so will the families they work to provide. And from there, it's just a short step to a happy society."
 DGR_emergency_mobilization: "Emergency Mobilization"
 DGR_emergency_mobilization_desc: "War in the metropolis will be quite specific. Already at this moment, we can see the troops of our new opponents on the other side of some streets. Mydlice will be a very critical point; we must conduct a very strong mobilization there. After all, people do not have to fight for the idea of communism if they can fight for their home and the safety of their families. This will certainly work. In other areas, we are separated by large forested terrains like Zielona Park or Zagórze Forest. This will allow for some tactical freedom...but we still need to recruit everyone capable of defending our reborn home."
 DGR_war_communism: "War Communism"
 DGR_war_communism_desc: "Solving our problems will not be easy, so temporarily we must undertake certain measures. Of course only for the duration of the war. No one expects it to last long, so they will grit their teeth and meekly comply. Oh...if only they knew they were going into a total war. All plants work at 200% capacity to fulfill all orders for the army. We will need 300% if we are to fight multiple opponents simultaneously. We must squeeze the last drop of sweat from every small workshop. Only overwhelming force and a crushing blow will allow us to emerge from this chaos unscathed. And since the army will now be the main decider of the state's fate, comrade Szwej doesn't need to be so aware of many things.\n\nAll power to the army. This is where the fun begins..."
 DGR_popular_army: "For the Popular Army!"
 DGR_popular_army_desc: "With the constant influx of fresh recruits, we can slowly phase out the criminal elements in favor of the youth, who are perfectly suited to building an army that believes in its ideals. National ideals. And we will be the sculptors who will shape them into perfect soldiers fulfilling the moral imperative of the revolution. But not necessarily a socialist revolution. Not in its strict sense. The political brass may be socialist, but we are the element that will bring victory for our homeland. And they will all depend on us for securing the future. And that future will not be populist. It will be national-populist!"
 DGR_to_arms_comrades: "To Arms Comrades!"
 DGR_to_arms_comrades_desc: "One might want to hum \"Arise, you wretched of the earth,\" but it seems they sing that in Sosnowiec. At least, sometimes you can hear it from their soldiers stationed in Zagórze. The pawns are positioned on the board, and each of us waits to see who will make the first move. In this duel of gunslingers, however, we must be wise. If we strike first, it may turn out that a third party will strike us at the worst possible moment. Dear officers, you must be clever and cunning. We have the most territory to cover, but we must turn this into our advantage, as maneuverability will be the key. Striking strategic points and cutting crucial communication nodes. Coordinate with army elements on your flanks. Stick to your training, and we will come out of this unscathed.\n\nAnd now, brothers! To arms! For a better tomorrow! For the glory of our Dąbrowian homeland!"

DGR_national_security_comission_desc: "It's war then. For a moment, I hoped that the esteemed political council would kindly back off from their ideas about military strategy. But of course, they have to add their two cents to topics they have no clue about. National Security Commission. More like the National Commission for Ensuring that Nationalists Don't Win the War Themselves. Fighting the enemy is easy. Fighting political old fogies however...it would be better to let me charge tanks on a bicycle. Comrade Szwej comes from times when the only preferred tactic was a mass charge into the unknown\n\nThe worst part is that the commission will decide on the allocation of the military budget for specific projects. I have a lot of convincing and political maneuvering ahead of me to ensure these are sensible investments."
DGR_nationalise_brembo_desc: "I hoped that we would transform the Brembo plant into a factory for military vehicle parts. So far, all I've gotten is the nationalization of the plant and very long internal fights over who will be on the new management board. There's no talk of transforming the production line until the old-timers divide the positions among themselves. This factory produced braking systems before the war, and all I can get are tons of brake discs and pads. I don't know if this is ironic, as no one slows down investments as much as party members. In the long run, at least the plant will be useful, once it starts operating."
DGR_connect_unused_railways_desc: "Many railway lines, both passenger and freight, in the city have fallen into disrepair. Yet, we have one of the most extensive freight rail networks in the country. The trains were crucial during the city's cleansing operations. We need to rebuild the damaged tracks and create a network of railway connections around the city. This will allow us to move equipment quickly to any front line. Perhaps we could also build a few armored trains?"
DGR_logistical_behemoth_desc: "The Sławków Euroterminal is one of the most important transshipment points in this part of Europe. It is located near the intersection of two Pan-European Transport Corridors and is connected to the major industrial plants in our city. Logistics will be crucial in the current wars. Warlords send their soldiers on deadly marches without support, proper supplies, or transportation. They might afford such idiotic tactics of wasting their people, but we cannot. Trucks, trains, cargo terminals, supply hubs—these are the foundations of a healthy army. One that every soldier will want to serve in."
DGR_commandeer_museum_vehicles_desc: "Lord giveth, and Lord taketh away. Yes, it's true. We stole vehicles from the museum to stage a coup against Bazylak. But they should have been guarded! The vehicles were returned to their original place after we abandoned them. Fortunately, no one else knew how to operate them, so they sat in front of the city hall for several months. But why shouldn't we use them? They are still operational machines, rearming them won't take long, and they are more useful now than ever. Besides, I got used to these steel beasts in those few hours. We're taking everything we can from Sztygarka."
DGR_secret_files_of_bankhutte_desc: "I can't believe my eyes. What started as a wild idea in my head has come true! My people combed through every archival document from the Bank Steelworks... sorry, Dzierżyński Steelworks. What they found there... wow. I don't know how it survived the years of communization, decommunization, and recommunization, but we found technical documents on tanks built here during World War II. Germans assembled Panthers and Tigers here! Unfortunately, there are no documents for V1 and V2 rockets. A pity. But still, if everything goes according to plan, we will be able to produce our own Panzerkampfwagen. Of course, rechristened in a communist style, with improved mechanisms and more modern weaponry. Just imagine the looks on our enemies' faces!"
DGR_first_mixed_brigade_desc: "An army doesn't live by infantry alone. To break through to the northern borders of Jura and Dąbrowian Basin, we will need maneuverability and vehicles capable of traversing difficult terrain. Yes, I am thinking ahead, but only this way will we be prepared for anything. We need a proper armored brigade. Okay, maybe we can't field a true one. But if we gather all our junk vehicles, detach them from infantry support, add newly produced vehicles, and combine them into a single armored fist, then we'll have at least some element of strength. It's more than what others have. And it will be a significant advantage."
DGR_restore_jw_sulno_desc: "During the communist era, there was a military unit in Sulno. Initially, it served as housing for workers involved in building the nearby micro-steelworks. Now, it's the perfect place to re-establish a military unit, given its proximity to Sosnowiec. Besides, we need to accommodate our growing number of soldiers somewhere. They can't keep sleeping in a hotel; it's absurd from a security standpoint. And they shouldn't have it too easy—after all, this is the army, not an all-inclusive vacation."
DGR_fortify_slawkow_desc: "Sławków is highly exposed to attacks from both Sosnowiec and Jaworzno. Since it's our key logistical hub, we can't leave it vulnerable. Therefore, it's essential to fortify the Euroterminal and all exposed railway lines. The damn forest doesn't make our job any easier, and enemy bands are just waiting for a moment of weakness to strike our critical points. We'll have to assign people to guard posts, as if I didn't already have enough problems with manpower."
DGR_turn_mydlice_into_fortress_desc: "Since the Battle of Stalingrad, the world has witnessed the horrors of urban warfare. Today, each of the massive communist apartment blocks stands as a fortress, perfectly suited for defense. Why bother with bunkers when a concrete jungle serves the same purpose at a lower cost? A bit of reinforced concrete makes the enemy think twice before entering a trap where every window could be a hail of bullets and projectiles. The sheer size of these skyscrapers also means nothing escapes our notice. And even if they manage to reach one building, they'll have to clear it floor by floor, apartment by apartment, room by room. The cost of capturing such a stronghold is simply prohibitive."
DGR_officers_in_gangs_desc: "We may have rushed too much in parting ways with the cannon fodder that the gangs represented. We'll need to make amends with them now that the time of trial has come, and wartime effort is required from everyone. However, there's no way we're just going to hand them weapons and let them run wild. Each gang unit will be assigned one of our officers. This way, we'll ensure control at every level and reduce the chances of rebellion or insubordination."
DGR_political_commissars_desc: "Swish, swoosh and bang - my dreams have gone up in smoke. I was hoping for officers who would answer to my authority, not ideological commissars who will dutifully report every minor infraction to the party leadership. I suppose I'd probably do the same in their position. But that's fine. Indoctrination and complete brainwashing take a long time, which makes such commissars quite valuable. Besides, our gang members aren't exactly skilled with grenades... accidents are bound to happen."
DGR_partisan_blitzkrieg_desc: "The vast expanse of our city allows for wide-front maneuver warfare to unfold here. However, the abundance of forests, lakes, apartment blocks, and overall biome diversity means we can primarily engage in guerilla warfare. Defending our territory isn't as daunting when every nook and cranny can serve as a hideout for partisans. Local knowledge will definitely tip the scales in our favor; even the smallest park will become a Vietnam or Afghanistan for any invaders."
DGR_revenge_at_czarzasty_desc: "Włodzimierz Czarzasty. The most reviled figure by anyone under 60. Unless, of course, you're 140 years old and a communist like Comrade Szwej. Czarzasty has always seen Zagłębie as his stronghold of support. But for what he's done to the left... the right will congratulate him, while leftists will want his blood. His traditionalist views are unchangeable, and his contemptuous attitude towards everyone else in the now thankfully defunct Intercounty has become legendary. Now we'll repay him in kind. As another leftist leader once said, a man is judged by how he finishes. And Czarzasty will end badly."
DGR_strike_back_at_antifa_desc: "Even more than the contemptible duo from Sosnowiec, I detest the rabble from Jaworzno. The anarcho-communists from Antifa have no respect for anyone. Whether it's Ziobro's puppets, us, or the Silesians, they'll rob, attack, and call everyone fascists. I've had enough of these 'border incidents' where gangs turn our border into their personal squat. We need to strike back, and we need to strike hard, so they won't even have a chance to lift their drug-fueled heads in response. The black terror of Antifa ends today!"
DGR_annexation_of_zagorze_desc: "Zagórze. Once a separate city, later annexed by Sosnowiec, and closely tied to Dąbrowa Górnicza. Let's be honest - most of the population lived there just to commute to work in the Dąbrowa steel mills. So why create unnecessary problems by maintaining a boundary between these two urban centers? We should simply annex Zagórze as a rightful district of Dąbrowa Górnicza. It always should have been that way. At least the boundaries will be neater and more logical."
DGR_railway_siewierz_zabkowice_desc: "We urgently need a railway connection running from our industrial centers to Pyrzowice Airport. Currently, the route goes through Zawiercie, but there's no need to detour there when we can run the railway straight through Siewierz and Mierzęcice. The airport will serve as our gateway to the world, and we plan to start moving a significant amount of goods through it—both for export and import. Until we can repair the roads, investing in trains will be more practical and cost-effective."
DGR_connect_lagisza_desc: "Będzin industry is going through very difficult times. The cement plant in Grodziec, the Będzin steelworks, the Grodziec coal mine, the shoe factory - none of these establishments exist anymore. The power plant in Łagisza itself operates at only about 20% of its nominal capacity. This is what capitalist rule has led to. A key branch of the economy has become a mere shadow of its former self - from the power plant, through the mines, and ending with the steelworks.\nWe must restore the proper strength of Będzin's industry by integrating it into our great industrial complex. By giving the first impulse ourselves, we will reactivate, step by step, all the closed plants, and it will be a fantastic investment in the future. And we will start with the steelworks."
DGR_question_of_leadership_desc: "The self-proclaimed capital of the Basin has fallen. How dared they call themselves the capital when the name itself is DĄBROWA BASIN, not SOSNOWIEC? But putting etymology aside, it must be acknowledged that Czarzasty built strong party structures here, something he failed to achieve across the country for so many years. Although everyone was ostensibly our opponent, and it's clear that many won't want to radicalize to fit our views, perhaps we can persuade some that our path is the right one. The question remains, though, whether we even want such people."
DGR_evict_squatters_desc: "Indeed, as much as one might criticize capitalist economies, the phenomenon of squatting is simply abhorrent. No matter who you are, how much you earn, or what you present, if bands of Antifa come knocking at your door, you can be sure that your property will turn into a haven for the worst kind of leftist degeneration. This has happened to a large number of apartments in Jaworzno - black squads had to find somewhere to settle, so they just kicked out random people - regardless of whether they were leftist or rightist, old or young, wealthy or poor. It was indiscriminate, treating everyone the same. But now, the time for justice has come. No squat will remain standing."
DGR_railway_around_myslowice_desc: "In Szczakowa, a northern district of Jaworzno, there is a large railway station connecting multiple lines. We need access to this station - a railway gateway that will open the way to the Silesian metropolis but won't lead to Katowice. It might also be wise to avoid Mysłowice, given the recent chaos with partisans and saboteurs. However, if we establish a new line from Euroterminal through Jaworzno and Imielin, we will create an easy route for encircling the metropolis and facilitating trade with Podbeskidzie and southern Małopolska."
DGR_connect_jaworzno_desc: "Fortunately for Jaworzno, true masters of industry have returned and are taking the helm. The Jaworzno Power Plant complex, combined with the rest of our energy network, will practically ensure independence from imports throughout the entire region. Meanwhile, Jaworzno's completely demolished industry will have to be thoroughly rebuilt. Recreational areas? Who needs them when people are starving!\nFirst, we will focus on rebuilding the glassworks in Szczakowa. After that, we will restore other elements of the city's industrial might that have been forgotten by previous governments."
DGR_question_of_councils_desc: "I wonder how anarchists ever achieved anything. Their communes are nothing more than another form of corrupt democracy. Adding to that, each operated for its own benefit, which makes it more accurate to call it not anarcho-communism but a rather strange form of anarcho-capitalism. Minister Gdula is the perfect example of this - he's a true hero of the real estate market! How can people like him even pretend to represent socialist ideals? At least I'm upfront about not having such ideals. Well, maybe sometimes I do."
DGR_reclaim_greater_zaglebie_desc: "Dąbrowa Basin isn't just Dąbrowa Górnicza, Sosnowiec, and Będzin. In fact, Jaworzno barely qualifies for that part. But the Basin also includes Olkusz, Zawiercie, and Myszków. At this rate, we might as well pull Częstochowa in too, so it doesn't feel left out in all of this. The situation is clear - we're now too far along to stop at just a few neighboring cities. I think I understand how Trotsky felt with his permanent revolution..."
DGR_red_star_over_jasna_gora_desc: "Jasna Góra. A symbol of Polish Catholicism. The Church has always had a somewhat ambivalent relationship with communism. Yes, it's known - Cardinal Wyszyński, Father Popiełuszko, and John Paul II destroyed little communists. But when we stand with the people, we cannot reject the Christian spirit in favor of some atheistic notions of young leftists. Belief in the Flying Spaghetti Monster won't heal a divided nation. And please, let's keep the priests away from young boys. We don't want a repeat of our parish issues..."
DGR_adjust_jura_factories_desc: "Myszków and Zawiercie have long been tied to heavy industry in their regions. Additionally, the Światowit plant used to produce Frania washing machines! Who wouldn't want such a marvel now, especially when there will be a perfect demand for them? But beyond washing machines, the metallurgical plants in the Jura region will fit seamlessly into our economic framework. We need to strike while the iron is hot, so we should immediately start restructuring these plants and shifting production to meet our growing needs. Primarily, for the war effort..."
DGR_play_like_its_82_desc: "They want to play? Let them have it. They shouldn't forget under whose rule the Polish national team achieved its greatest successes. I know it's the twilight of their era, it's martial law times. But still, it says a lot about our sporting society. And since then? A quarter-final at Euro 2016 and defeats to powerhouses like Moldova, Kazakhstan, and the Faroe Islands. Coach Brzęczek might have the right ideas, but he lacks a solid state apparatus and a big, fucking army. And that's what we have. You can't build an army based on hooligans. Oh, wait. We kinda did."
DGR_death_forests_of_lubliniec_desc: "Lubliniec was supposed to be a walk in the park; the area isn't heavily urbanized or situated at particularly strategic points. Yet, fighting on these cursed fields is far from pleasant, and engaging with commandos is not easy, even, or perhaps especially, after their surrender. Especially considering they have access to fucking huge forests where they hide like cursed soldiers. How are we going to flush them out from there?"
DGR_imagine_shrooms_desc: "I sent my people to the slaughter. I don't even want to think about how many senseless deaths occurred in those cursed forests. Even setting them on fire didn't help. On the contrary, I'm sure that the fire has added dozens of soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorders to our losses. From Woźniki to Pawonki, the dead are piling up, and the devastation will remind us for weeks that we made a colossal mistake. And we still have to extinguish the fires and gather the bodies before they turn the soil into fertile ground for fungi."
DGR_offer_for_supreme_coach_desc: "Mr. Brzęczek, I respect you. You're an ideologically driven man - ambitious and with an extraordinary zeal for achieving your goals. Unfortunately, on the wrong side of the barricade. But don't worry, all Poles are one family, and the ideology of Marxism-Clubbism is so hysterically absurd that I can't help but respect the serious way you pursue such nonsense. Indeed, it's a better idea than most leftist movements. I'm not saying I'd be eager to implement it, but our cause needs people like you. Personally, I'd even be willing to persuade you to our side, offering amnesty for your closest collaborators and autonomy for the clubs. And if not, there's always room for a new coach at Tęcza Błędów..."
DGR_question_of_church_desc: "Częstochowa, as Poland's religious capital, has quite a socialist streak. After all, since 2010, it has been governed by a leftist president - one of the few who has managed to hold on in the country. Just like in Dąbrowa. Perhaps we could extract what's needed from this religious mix and create something interesting? For example, a nationalism rooted in Polish Catholic traditions combined with the socialist traits attributed to Jesus in the Bible. After all, he was considered one of the greatest socialists, as the classic saying goes. It seems to me that Comrade Konieczny (the one from the PPS, not the Antifa thug) was right in trying to create a popular religious organization here. We should seriously discuss this with him."
DGR_great_combine_desc: "What's better than one steel mill? Multiple steel mills working towards the same goal. Why waste time and money managing several separate plants when you can consolidate them into a massive central metallurgical complex that can handle any order in no time? Compatibility and interchangeability between specific units will be far more cost-effective than dividing them into separate entities. Or maybe I just know fuck all about economics and am spouting bullshit. Ah, but that would still make me more competent than our Minister of Economy."
DGR_avanti_popolo_desc: "The National People's Army has triumphed! From Częstochowa to Jaworzno, people can rejoice because we've reached the historic moment when, after many years, we are finally the masters of our own cities. The entire region deserves this tremendous revolutionary surge - we are the industrial heart of Poland, while Silesia is a shitty old pigsty. We carry the spark of pioneers who will renew this country! Each of us heralds greatness, justice, and equality. And rest assured - we will bring this torch of popular freedom to the rest of the country. Sooner or later."

DGR_we_forge_our_tomorrow_desc: "Sometimes I wonder if what I'm doing has any real significance. I'm just a tool of fate, one that can be discarded once the job is done. No matter what path I choose, in the end, it turns out that I'm not the one making the choices. The game was rigged from the start. Nationalism, communism, paganism - none of it matters. All that matters is playing your role well. Maybe then an opportunity will arise to change the status quo of reality. But for now, glory to the working people of cities and countryside, I guess... We're forging a new, national-popular future. How many more slogans will we churn out before they lose their meaning?"
DGR_unity_congress_desc: "The Party is calling. I'd pity myself if I had access to this Congress of the Working Class, but unfortunately, military personnel aren't welcome. I could argue that we work the hardest so that the apparatchiks can rot in their offices, enjoying freedom and life. But they can even have a damn UN summit if they want. The National People's Army now has enough influence in the country that it doesn't matter what decisions the comrades make."
DGR_civilian_rule_under_army_desc: "The party members deliberate, while the army decides. As Comrade Wiesław used to say, \"Power once seized will never be relinquished.\" And we certainly do not intend to give up our privileged position over the civilian authorities. We are the sole guarantors of our state's existence, and under the military banner, the national-popular future will flourish! It wasn't the bureaucrats who defended Sławków from the Antifa black gangs, nor did they defeat the enemies of communism in the Dąbrowa Basin, nor did they capture Jasna Góra. It was the army. And the army... is ours. Well, to be honest... it's MINE."
DGR_recommunization_desc: "There are, however, some things I have no control over, no matter how hard I try. But then again, it's not surprising. Nationalist rhetoric and symbolism are already well established in Poland. It's the communist one that needs to be revived and dug out of the infernal abyss. Only then will the idea of national communism be achieved when both elements mix and balance each other. As long as neither idea oversteps its bounds. Well, unless it's us. We can."
DGR_symbolism_act_desc: "In Poland, the hammer and sickle have always been regarded with the same revulsion as the swastika. Not much will change in that regard, so it's best to leave their use in the past. If we want to be taken seriously as a movement and not be lumped together with Stalin and Bierut, we need to promote our own symbols. The red lightning bolt and the red hammer - what could be more subtle and powerful than combining these two elements? After all, the hammer will forge the iron sword with which we will defeat all our enemies as fast as lightning."
DGR_authority_dilemma_desc: "Joseph Stalin did nothing wrong. Che Guevara was a revolutionary hero. Such statements often circulate within the left. But just as the right venerates murderers, the left also has a tendency to place truly unsavory figures on a pedestal. We must be different. I won't allow anyone in our circles to use authorities that are absurd to Poles. And perhaps, in the end, we might even reject Marx as the spiritual progenitor of all communism. After all, Hegelian ideas might suit us better than the ramblings of a privileged Jew who never worked a day in his life."
DGR_private_enterprises_desc: "The cult of entrepreneurs has reached its peak in our late capitalism. The exploitation of ordinary people by pathological liars who consider themselves the backbone of the Polish economy has been staggering. People were forced to live in a free market that guaranteed them nothing, primarily not even survival until the next day. Corporations, private profiteers, fraudsters, and thieves - each of them will face the hand of justice. And that hand wields a sword with which we will give every exploiter what they deserve. Under this communist postulate... I will sign with both hands"
DGR_fallen_monuments_desc: "It's somewhat amusing how certain public institutions in the Dąbrowa Basin suddenly came into possession of long-lost communist monuments following the announcement to restore them. It turns out that decommunization didn't mean destroying symbols or severing ties with the past; it was merely a \"hide it for later, it might come in handy\" operation. And now, it indeed comes in handy. How on earth did they know?"
DGR_living_factory_desc: "A workplace is like a second home. While that doesn't mean you should actually spend the night there, it does imply that major facilities should offer the right kind of amenities. Modern corporations boast about their game rooms, book nooks, and foosball tables. That's great, but we should go further. Our workplaces should feature restaurants, bars, and various public establishments. This not only fills our coffers but also boosts morale significantly. Let the revitalized Defum plant in Dąbrowa Górnicza, now known as The Living Factory, be the prime example. We've refurbished the factory, but the local pubs and eateries remain, serving the workers after, of course, and not during working hours."
DGR_security_service_desc: "I always wanted to have my own security forces. But it seems that this idea will be turned against me. Comrades from the government are working hard to minimize the influence of the army and to have any form of defense against potential internal threats. So maybe it's time to hurry up? Maybe this is a sign from fate? Otherwise, it might soon turn out that all the top officers will either face trials or, at worst, just disappear"
DGR_government_reconstruction_desc: "About time. I've long maintained that this grotesque caricature mistakenly called the People's Front is fit only for the dustbin of history. The chief relic of the Dąbrowa communist era has decreed that the government will undergo a radical overhaul, and that the newly appointed officials will be more in line with the ideals of our state. It's rather amusing how deeply he has insulted his current ministers in the process. If I were in their position, I would take this to heart and flee while there's still a chance to do so on my own terms. But it's not about me, is it?"
DGR_silesian_faction_desc: "I understand that Szwej feels isolated, but forming some kind of group of communist super comrades is senseless. We would only create a criminal regime preoccupied with internal power struggles rather than fighting external enemies. We do not need more communists, especially those unsure whether they want to praise Gierek or Gomułka. Some have even ventured far beyond our eastern border and prefer Mao Zedong. Deng Xiaoping might be tolerable, but Maoists? Next thing I know, we'll be recruiting Pol Pot enthusiasts or adherents of Juche..."
DGR_cult_of_gierek_desc: "If there is someone in the Dąbrowa Basin who could be equated with John Paul II in terms of mythologization and cult, it is undoubtedly comrade Edward Gierek, the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party in the 1970s. He was originally from Sosnowiec, which is already a plus for him. But just ask someone who had the chance to live during those times, and they will tell you that comrade Gierek built the power of the Basin. Thanks to him, Dąbrowa Górnicza developed unimaginably. In 1970, the city's population was 60,000. By the end of his rule, it had already reached 140,000, more than double! His investments laid the foundations for this magnificent city, tamed the industrial potential of the Dąbrowa Basin, and exploited it to the fullest. And for that, people still love him. Because after him... things only got worse."
DGR_partisans_faction_desc: "As a former partisan, I firmly say that we should pursue this path. The path of nationalist-populism. We don't need more communists - what we need is a strong nationalist faction capable of uniting people from various backgrounds under the banner of nationalist rhetoric. That way, it won't matter whether someone follows Stalin or Dmowski; they will be able to integrate into our structures. And, I won't hide it - more allies for me in the Politburo."
DGR_civilian_apparatus_desc: "And as I expected, the Gierek faction is raising their voice, claiming that the army has too many powers, and its freedoms and influence must be radically cut. What the fuck. Clip our wings and then wonder why we're not flying. So far, all they've managed to do is expand the civilian administration and start a civil-military conflict. However, the further we go, the worse it will get. This won't end well - they won't stop, and we won't go down easily. War is coming."
DGR_wide_socialist_front_desc: "I retract what I said about Pol Potists and Jucheists. Because that's indeed the direction we're heading. Fortunately, there don't seem to be any Posadists yet. But knowing the realities of the Politburo, it's only a matter of time. Szwej already has ideas from outer space, so what would it be for him to proclaim a communist revolution brought by aliens? I just want to remind everyone - there was already one such attempt to create a great socialist front. In fact, several. In elections, the left always wanted to form grand coalitions to barely make it over the threshold. And the second one was called the Intercounty. We all remember how that ended."
DGR_progress_fund_desc: "I feel like something like this has been done before. Ah, yes, the Economic Progress Fund already existed. In fact, now I see it has the same goals - funding for farmers who suffered during the wars. Of course, aid will be granted only if they prepare the land for collectivization or fall under the protection of state agricultural enterprises. Clever move, Minister. We all know that farmers won't refuse such hefty subsidies. Just hope this fund lasts longer than its predecessor did, which was barely two years."
DGR_national_socialism_desc: "We have a strong socialist political front. We have nationalist elements in the army. So... I don't want to be the one explaining basic math here, but wouldn't this work out to be something like... National Socialism? Maybe use Socialist Nationalism, it might go down easier. You could have had a true nationalist-populist revolution, but instead, you'll end up with a strange amalgam of popular ideologies seasoned with an antagonistic military. The Soviet Union would be proud. The Third Reich, not so much, despite the name."
DGR_cult_of_moczar_desc: "The legacy of the factional wars in the PRL still affects our society, especially now. On one side, the socialists adhering to Gierek, on the other, we, the nationalist-populist patriots who now need a symbol as strong as the first secretary from Sosnowiec. And there is no better choice than Mieczysław Moczar, who embodied the idea of national-communism and right-wing nationalist tendencies. He will be the figure whose spirit will unite our political environment under one ideology. Let us just cool down with the antisemitic remarks for now."
DGR_military_government_desc: "If comrade Szwej's problem is that the military has far more influence on reality than the government, I have a solution for him. Simply integrate military personnel into the government. Isn't that simple? No more passively accepting idiotic political regulations from above. The National People's Army must become the official executive branch of our country because only this way can true revolution be realized. We will end all internal conflicts within the government and among politicians once and for all. They could use some real military discipline. If we shout loud enough... they'll agree to anything."
DGR_ideological_purity_desc: "Too much of anything is unhealthy. Ideological fragmentation does not serve the unity and strength of our state. We've seen this before with the unified front in the Basin; sooner or later, the leftists will turn on each other, and nothing will stop them from tearing apart even the greatest power. I believe we are ready for phase two. For what I have been building here since I decided that betraying my ideals and joining the Popular Front would be an investment in the future. And the future is now, old man. We stand on the brink of a glorious creation, a glorious revolution which will see this country reborn."
DGR_army_lobbying_desc: "The situation is very simple. We don't enter the government to avoid benefiting from it. And since every gain we make is an investment in the safety of our nation, that's a secondary matter, but a good one that arises from this entire cycle. We won't have to constantly beg the Politburo or threaten them with rebellion to get something. Now, we'll simply take what is rightfully ours, and no ministerial complaints will be able to stop us. We will strengthen the army to the point where all my dreams can be realized. And they are grand ones."
DGR_national_bolshevism_desc: "A time comes in the history of humanity when extraordinary individuals stand at a crossroads and are forced to make difficult choices that will determine the future of many. The National People's Army is ready. Our people within government institutions are also ready. The Palace of Culture will be surrounded. Comrade Szwej will undergo a long, enforced conversation with me. We will clarify a few things, and this time, it won't end as it did before. Lessons were learned here. And let hell consume me if we fail now. The plan has been years in the making; I was born for this moment. The previous failure was merely an element designed to prepare me for today. National Bolshevism, or death."
DGR_5_year_plan_desc: "Economic plans are cool. Instead of chaotic investments in whatever the global economy throws at us and all those theories about supply and demand, we're executing our objectives step by step. The capitalists are furious because, of course, you can't arbitrarily decide in which year to build which sectors of the economy, you have to think about Hayek. I couldn't fucking care less about the Austrians and their damned economic school; nothing enslaves people like capitalism. We know what people need, and we will steer to complete the seventh Five-Year Plan in Polish history. The seventh. The six previous ones clearly showed that the results are positive."
DGR_heavy_industry_nationalisation_desc: "Heavy industry is the backbone of the nation. The prosperity of the state depends on its proper functioning; the entire national economy relies on it. Therefore, we cannot allow a private entity to dictate terms to the state by controlling a key sector of the economy. No. All strategic economic positions and heavy industries must be state-owned to ensure that they work for the nation, rather than enriching some private individual at the expense of the country's future. Only nationalized enterprises will be cared for by their administrators as if they were their most cherished family."
DGR_restore_defunct_plants_desc: "The Balcerowicz Plan and its consequences have been a disaster for the Polish nation. The economy was completely devastated, enterprises went bankrupt in large numbers, and vast swathes of people were left without jobs or prospects for the future. The way in which liberal governments over the following decades attempted to eradicate any signs of Polish economic spirit deserves a separate category of national treason. Entire sectors - mining, metallurgy, shipbuilding, automotive industry - collapsed, yet those responsible for this never faced any consequences. Now they will. We shall, step by step, restore all the fallen enterprises to life. For the people. By the people."
DGR_prefab_apartments_desc: "Liberal governments loved to boast about the number of apartments they built and the wonderful lodgings they created. They were completely indifferent to the fact that ordinary people couldn't afford to live in their magnificent villas. After all, some wealthy investor would eventually come along and invest in real estate. A young person stands no chance of owning their own apartment; if they're lucky, they might afford to rent a tiny room in a six-person house within a cramped block. We need a mass housing program. A mass one, not just three hundred small units once every ten years."
DGR_real_estate_crash_desc: "I don't know if there's a worse creature than a landlord. In our state, the real estate market has essentially collapsed. Total breakdown, thanks to our efforts. And that's a good situation. On the ruins of this sick system, we can build a new world where there's no need to rely on the benevolence of real estate agents who might graciously lower the rent by 2 zlotys per square meter, while increasing utility fees by several hundred zlotys. Enough of flippers, enough of exploitation. Housing is a human right, not a commodity! And for those who so eagerly played with people's lives and mocked this fundamental right, we have special housing. Nice ones, where they'll never have to move out for the rest of their lives."
DGR_pgr_desc: "Farmers have become quite spoiled since the fall of communism. They've absorbed capitalist ideology to the core, which, combined with their socialist roots and demands, has created a terrifying mix. Entitlement, a lack of communal spirit, and no sense of responsibility towards society. The National Agricultural Farms we're introducing today will bring them back to reality and cement the image of the farmer as one who cares for the national community by feeding the entire country, not just themselves. And this is just the beginning of the changes they will face."
DGR_collectivisation_desc: "Privatization of agricultural land was a disastrous move towards liberalism. The conflicts surrounding this event persist to this day, and some farmers simply have no clue about management and shouldn't be involved at all. Therefore, collectivization will help achieve excellent results. Those who can work will work. Those who can manage will manage. Everyone in their place, everyone working hard for the common good. We will start with agriculture. Eventually, we will achieve a true national community where the fruits of labor will serve everyone who is honored to belong to our nation."
DGR_wait_and_see_desc: "The seed of productivity has been sown. The plans have been outlined, the organizations prepared to begin production according to the appropriate standards and agendas. Programs essential for the functioning of the five-year plan have been launched. Everyone knows what they must do.\nYes, there may be some fluctuations in the markets due to the revolutionary changes we are carrying out here. Surely, things will get worse for a while before they get better. But now, all that remains is to stay the course, do our work, and wait... for the fruits of our labor. And then we will savor their taste without having to tighten our belts any longer. It's almost here. Just five years."
DGR_green_utopia_desc: "Bas Tajpan, who recently decided to engage politically under his real name, presented a package of laws today that are intended as a response to the Green New Deal. To me, it seems like he's trying to be holier than the Pope, scrutinizing all European regulations and tightening the screws twice as hard. Banning car production, banning animal husbandry, dismantling our heavy industry and energy sector. I don't know if this man is joking or if he's a damn saboteur. No one in their right mind would take this seriously. Even Comrade Dementia isn't detached enough from reality to make us all frolic in green meadows like Disney princesses in a few years."
DGR_legalizacja_teraz_legalizacja_tu_desc: "From the start, I knew that dealing with this parasite would bring nothing but trouble! Perhaps if he had stayed sober, he wouldn't have had the energy to spout nonsense about the medicinal properties of drugs. And now Minister Krępa thinks it's the perfect time to give the Politburo an ultimatum - legalization of marijuana. So, all those previous ideas were just a smokescreen for this one issue. What frightens me is how many supporters he seems to have. Am I not the only member of the People's Front who has secretly been building an underground power base, waiting for the right moment?"
DGR_appease_them_desc: "If it shuts his damn mouth, so be it - I might even vote for legalization. Let him get high and keep him away from the Politburo meetings, because, as God is my witness, I'll light up a two-meter joint up his ass if he shows up again. And yes, we've got those in the army. They're called short-range missiles. Still, it seems like an appropriate approach to the current problem. People are shouting for something, demanding something. With legalization, at least we'll have control over the substance and its distribution, and we won't create another black market. We've had enough trouble with that already."
DGR_people_are_pissed_desc: "Okay, it seems like people weren't specifically asking for marijuana legalization... because they're still protesting. Today, strike committees were formed at the Myszków and Zawiercie factories. If it's not about marijuana... then what is it? They have housing - somewhat livable. They receive money - what they can buy with it is not our concern; we're in a civil war. Alcohol and cigarettes aren't taxed by us, so they're even cheaper. Security - provided. What could they possibly be missing?"
DGR_strikes_spreading_desc: "Freedom? What is freedom to a bunch of workers whose life goal is to work 8 hours, go to the pub with his mates, and then return to a wife who's rotting at home with the kids? What deeper needs could they possibly have that make democracy essential for them? None. People are divided into the ruling class and those destined to be ruled. Someone is inciting our workers; they aren't capable of such profound thoughts on their own to realize they are being controlled. We'll send security services to every factory to unmask the agitators. In the meantime, we need to start thinking about prevention because factories in Częstochowa, Sosnowiec, and Lubliniec are now joining the strikes..."

The teams from all units of the National People's Army are ready to start the competition, warming up before the games and eagerly awaiting the first whistle from the officiating officers. Before you, the opening match - the 1st Battalion 'Edmund Cedler' will face off against the striking workers from the Zawiercie Steelworks. Who will win? We can only guess, though the favorite is undoubtedly the Red Banner Battalion. We also invite you to the other matches scheduled for this week at the largest industrial facilities in your city. Guaranteed beatings or deportation to a labor camp."
DGR_czolgi_na_hute_desc: "And you, steelworkers of Dąbrowa, you too? Stabbing us in the back? There will be no bread, because there is none. There is vinegar and steel. There will be no freedom either, because you don't need it. But refusal to work in strategically important factories during martial law will be met with the harshest penalty. The Politburo has agreed to execute the most radical of preventive scenarios. Tanks will once again head towards the Katowice Steelworks. And this time there will be no agreements, no Solidarity, and no Round Table. There will be pain, toil, and gnashing of teeth."
DGR_history_repeating_desc: "We cannot afford to be weak again. History tends to repeat itself, but in this case, it's so we can learn from our mistakes and not repeat them. Making concessions with striking workers is the first and greatest mistake one can make in the face of mass protests. We will respond to any sign of resistance to our authority with an iron fist and fire. As the historical maxim goes: \"Any provocateur or lunatic who dares to raise a hand against the people's authority can be certain that authority will sever that hand.\"\n\nCyrankiewicz was right. Today more than ever."
DGR_komu_to_potrzebne_desc: "Legalize marijuana? Why? Who needs it? We did not fight so hard against the criminal drug underground in Dąbrowa just to allow junkies to corrupt society once again. I will never vote for it. We are trying to build a new community, free from substances and addictions, not to surrender to the weaknesses of the underworld. No one will convince me that this is normal and natural. I have seen enough of the effects of this so-called \"wonder drug,\" which drives young people into debt and leaves their minds foggy as if they were perpetually dazed."
DGR_nowy_protest_desc: "In Zielona Park, government documents related to the criminalization of drugs, including marijuana, were just burned. The event was led by Minister Krępa, also known as Bas Tajpan. Then everyone started singing some nonsensical song about how, if they were a magician with three wishes, they would choose a kilo of marijuana. And then another song that goes like, \"Dąbrowa Górnicza, dressed in prohibition. Killed nobody, but still prohibited\" Yes, we all know those worthless artistic pieces. But for a minister to do something like this is a slap in the face of authority. And for this insult, Bas Tajpan will pay dearly."
DGR_diss_na_rzad_desc: "Minister Damian Krępa is no longer a said minister. Once someone starts opposing their own government while still being part of it, it no longer makes sense. Thus, we facilitated his trip to rock bottom by dismissing him immediately. Loyal government units are already heading towards the capital to crush this rebelling scum into dust. I can't wait for the last subversive element to vanish from our streets. The rest will disperse very quickly, and the situation will be under control.\n\nWait... is that idiot really putting on a concert in front of the palace?"
DGR_criminal_hydra_desc: "It's clear that a significant portion of our soldiers come from ghettos and gangster rap communities. One can leave a criminal environment, but mental poverty remains incurable. And it's within such circles that Bas Tajpan found his support. This concerns me greatly because it means that within the National People's Army, there is a cancer that will be hard to cure. Striking workers are breaking the law, so by definition, they have also become criminals. It will be difficult to manage a nation where the majority stands on the other side of the law.\n\nI'm worried about issuing the order to break through to the capital at all costs through blocked streets. There's a risk that soldiers might refuse to carry out the order. If that happens, it would mean they are criminals too... My head is starting to ache from all this."

So, I have what I deserve. It's strange that I wasn't shot or burned at the stake on the spot, whatever they might have preferred. Locked in some dark cell, I await my fate. Meanwhile, the infamous \"Babylon\" is burning. Literally, the coup was executed amidst the flames of several fires in the capital. And the striking workers haven't even lifted a finger to help us. So, we face a Rastafarian future."

bedzincon.1000.t: "Intercounty Calling"
bedzincon.1000.desc: "News from Sosnowiec! Włodzimierz Czarzasty has decided to organize a second Congress of the Intercounty in response to the tense regional situation. Invitations have been sent to all active members of the alliance, who, along with their delegations, are expected to arrive in three days at the congress, which will take place in Będzin, at the Będzin Arena sports and events hall.\n\nLittle is known about the exact reason behind this sudden decision by the leader of Sosnowiec. It is suspected that recent machinations related to the very city where the congress is to be held may be of significance here. The agenda of the meeting has also not been shared with the delegates, raising serious doubts about the legitimacy and goals of this congress.\n\nNonetheless, it appears that none of the delegations intend to ignore Czarzasty's summons. On the contrary, they are likely to seize every opportunity to fight for their interests on the stage of the Intercounty.\n\nTime will tell what this is really about."
bedzincon.1000.a: "Workers of the Poland, unite!"

bedzincon.1.t: "Congress of Będzin - Czarzasty's Opening Speech"
bedzincon.1.desc: "A warm welcome to all - delegates and guests alike - who have honored us with their presence at the Second Congress of the Intercounty. As one of its leaders, my heart is filled with joy when I see so many determined faces before me, ready to shape our future. We come from diverse backgrounds, but what unites us is this: we were, we are, and we will remain the foundation of socialism on Polish soil. Ladies and gentlemen, has our society ever been as divided since the time of systemic transformation as it is today? For over a decade, the Polish right wing led our country toward collapse - and, sadly, that collapse finally came. Now, in 2027, after two years of unrelenting civil war, we must finally ask ourselves: When will this hopeless struggle end? When will we begin working toward unity and rebuilding our nation?\n\nWe, here today, as the vanguard of socialist thought, say: \"Enough!\". We are choosing a different path - one where open deliberation, dialogue, and unity are our core values. Yet, even among those gathered here, situations arise that require us to act through other means. We are meeting here in Będzin not by coincidence. The authorities of both Czeladź and Będzin have betrayed the values we all committed to at the first congress. With a heavy heart, I must say that the politics they pursued were so reckless that we, as the New Left, had to intervene directly to prevent a split. But to calm any troubled minds - let it be known that the delegates from those cities are here with us. We still stand together. We exclude no one.\n\nWe have gathered here for a crucial purpose. The cracks in the foundation of our alliance cannot be allowed to repeat. That is why I appeal to all of you gathered here - let us open ourselves to dialogue. And the subject of that discussion must be our centralization policy. For too long, we've been stuck in separate quasi-state institutions. For too long, we've stood apart - united only in name. To unify the country, we must first unify the Left. We must set an example to every faction in this fragmented land, showing that just as we stand united here today, every true leftist should stand with us and begin the process of unification! In the coming days, we will be discussing many matters - economics, security, internal and external affairs. And also about how we can ensure that the Intercounty is not just a slogan thrown to the wind, but a real force that can change Poland.\n\nThank you once again for coming here.\nLong live the victorious people!"
bedzincon.1.a: "Welcome Comrades!"

bedzincon.2.t: "Congress of Będzin - Konieczny's Speech"
bedzincon.2.desc: "Comradesses, comrades, and comradely persons.\n\nIt is an honor to speak here on behalf of the delegation representing all the communes of Jaworzno, Mysłowice, Imielin, Lędziny, and Chełm Śląski. This very diversity proves that true unification is already underway - and frankly, I don't quite understand the emphasis Chairman Czarzasty placed on this goal. It is the Council of Communes, supported by the communal militias and Antifa, that represents the most community-driven model in the entire Intercounty. So I find it strange that those with the weakest social mandate are the ones here preaching about centralization. I was elected by dozens of councils to represent their interests to the best of my ability. You? You clawed your way into power over the corpses of others. So please, don't lecture us on how to achieve unity - we probably understand it better than any of you.\n\nTo everyone willing to work together on our terms, we say: \"Welcome!\" and extend our hand. To those who seek to discredit or interfere with our way of life by raising their hands at us - ...well, let's just say you know exactly what we will do with that hand of yours. It was our communes that stood on the front lines against the fascist raiders of Ziobro's. It was with the blood of our fallen comrades that we defended the Zagłębie, and we were the ones who felt that invasion the hardest. Our border is the most exposed to conflict with the constant warmongering of puppet prosecutors. We are the ones facing down Silesian agitators, who, under the guise of separatism, seek not to unite but to divide this nation! Day in and day out, we operate in Mysłowice and other Silesian towns to prevent the spread of brownshirt terror and hatred toward working people.\n\nBut - as Chairman Czarzasty rightly pointed out - danger also lurks from within. It's a good diagnosis, but as always, I fear the prescribed cure may be the wrong one. That's why I will do everything in my power to ensure that our interests are respected, and that proper conclusions and solutions are adopted. Unfortunately, there is an unspoken code of silence in our circles regarding inconvenient issues. Allow me, then, to elaborate on some of the problems our alliance is facing. Someone must be held accountable for the fact that what we've built here is not fully functioning. And the truth is... those responsible are among us right now. Because the greatest blame lies with..."

bedzincon.3.t: "Congress of Będzin - Szwej's Speech"
bedzincon.3.desc: "Welcome, comrades, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Polish United... pardon me, of the Intercounty Workingmen's Association. In recent years, Poland has been burdened by much evil, injustice, and painful collapse. The ideals of socialism - steeped in the spirit of human freedom and respect for citizens' rights - have, in practice, suffered deep distortions. Words did not match reality. The hard labor of the working class and the entire nation bore no expected fruit. But I firmly believe those years are now gone, lost to the past. The first congress of our Intercounty was met with an enthusiastic response from the working class and the broad popular masses. In gatherings across the entire Zagłębie region, workers, intellectuals, students, soldiers, and all working people voiced their support and trust in the new leadership - leadership that will guide this region to victory.\n\nComrades! Let us not allow reactionary agitators and common hooligans to block our path. Let them stay far away from the pure current of struggle waged by the socialist and patriotic forces of our nation! Drive out the provocateurs and reactionary loudmouths! The state authorities will not, even for a moment, tolerate any action aimed against our national interest or our state system.\nComrades! Time is pressing. The parties of Zagłębie must get to work solving the everyday, difficult problems of our economy and state life. How can you help the party leadership and government today? First and foremost, by standing by your workbenches and posts, showing through intensified labor and learning your loyalty and devotion to our cause - the rebuilding of our country after the terrible downfall that struck our entire Polish world. Today, I call upon the working people of Dąbrowa Górnicza and all of Zagłębie: enough of rallies and Polish-against-Polish conflict! It is time to return to daily work, animated by the faith and conviction that a party united with the working class and the people will lead us to build a new path to socialism for all of Poland.\n\nBut above everything we should focus our attention and dedication to..."
bedzincon.3.a: "...an immortal idea of socialism!"
bedzincon.3.b: "...a fight with spit-flecked reactionary dwarves!"

bedzincon.4.t: "Congress Day 2 - Investment Cooperation"
bedzincon.4.desc: "On the second day of the congress, one of the key programmatic points became the establishment of a People's Reconstruction Fund - a joint initiative aimed at financing the most disadvantaged communities, areas, and populations that suffered the most during the Fall. However, the contributions to this fund are relatively limited and, unfortunately, cannot meet the immense demand for distributing aid to everyone in need. Delegations, made up of ministers responsible for the economies of the invited states, now face the task of deciding where these limited resources should go first.\n\nThe Sosnowiec delegation argues that urban infrastructure was hit the hardest. Riots, building collapses, and postwar destruction have left an enormous mark on city structures. To return to normal functioning, they argue, the focus should be on repairing major city roads, restoring the facades of key buildings, and clearing out structures that are now nothing more than piles of rubble.\n\nThe Dąbrowa delegation counters this by pointing out that urban infrastructure is useless if the economy is in ruins. They propose redirecting the fund toward reviving collapsed industrial plants, noting that some of them didn't fall due to the war, but because capitalism itself was the nail in their coffin. This, they argue, is where the debate must begin - on ideological grounds - as the restoration of these workplaces is an ideological imperative.\n\nThe Jaworzno delegation, on the other hand, expresses disbelief that anyone would focus so heavily on cities and industry while ignoring the basic conditions necessary for survival. They call for prioritizing the reconstruction of small suburban communes, many of which have worked tirelessly to feed urban populations. These communities, they argue, will become the foundation of the new society, and it is they who should receive the investments."

bedzincon.5.t: "Congress Day 2 - Common Market"
bedzincon.5.desc: "The culmination of the \"economic\" day of the Congress was a conference on the potential benefits of establishing a common market, which would ideally recognize the needs of the poorest and - through appropriate regulation - allow for the implementation of the old Marxist doctrine: from each according to their ability, to each according to their need. However:\n\nThe Sosnowiec delegation proposed the creation of a central authority to oversee all redistribution processes based on need. This idea, however, was heavily criticized by the other two delegations, who believe it could lead to inequality and injustice.\n\nThe Dąbrowa Górnicza delegation offered a counterproposal: they support the creation of a common market, but redistribution should not be based on equality, rather on what each member produces. They argue this would prevent resource cannibalization by societies unable to make practical use of those materials, while allowing producers to maintain control over what is created and redistributed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jaworzno delegation issued a firm ultimatum: they cannot agree to any intermediary or centralized form of a common market. Only complete and unconditional redistribution of goods for all can reconcile their position with the ideological demands of their allies."
bedzincon.5.a: "Common Market without material redistribution"
bedzincon.5.b: "Common Central Market organisation"
bedzincon.5.c: "Total redistribution of wealth to all!"

bedzincon.6.t: "Congress Day 3 - Armed Forces"
bedzincon.6.desc: "Day three of the Congress revolved entirely around the issue of forming a joint armed force that would represent the alliance on the international stage and serve as the primary military if (or rather, when) fighting resumes in Poland. Defense ministers from the member states clashed fiercely over the matter, and once again, consensus seems out of reach.\n\nThe Sosnowiec delegation put forward a proposal to create the Intercounty Army - a trans-warlord force in which all alliance members would participate. Command would be elected by councils, and the army would function independently from local armed forces, which would be reduced to mere local security units.\n\nDąbrowa Górnicza found the idea interesting but objected to the proposed command structure and hierarchy. They suggested instead the formation of Red Brigades, into which each member would delegate their local battalions under a shared command, but armies would remain their own.\n\nThe Jaworzno delegation rejected any concept of a unified army outright. They argued that the most socially just and effective solution would be the creation of local militias in every commune and city district, serving as grassroots defense forces against external threats while cooperating equally and horizontally with other militias for coordination purposes."
bedzincon.6.a: "Red Brigades"
bedzincon.6.b: "Central Intercounty Army"
bedzincon.6.c: "Militias in every commune!"

bedzincon.7.t: "Congress Day 4 - Internal Policy"
bedzincon.7.desc: "Day four began with several conferences addressing health policy, education, and the judiciary. These sessions managed to establish a basic programmatic framework, though it was soon overshadowed by a core issue: the lack of internal policy uniformity among member states. This culminated in a crucial debate over the centralization of domestic policy.\n\nSosnowiec made their position clear - they believe a coherent and unified internal policy must be pursued wherever common ground can be found. To them, this would serve as the foundation for constitutionalizing the Intercounty, becoming the binding force around which they could unite and clearly state: these are our values.\n\nDąbrowa Górnicza, however, took issue with the element of compulsion. While they agreed with the overall aim, they disagreed on certain specifics. They instead advocated for an amendment stating that the shared framework should be treated as an aspirational goal, but that each member state should be free to implement it according to its own legal interpretation.\n\nThe Jaworzno delegate struggled to contain his anger throughout, repeatedly interrupting other speakers and shouting that he had been sent there explicitly to prevent such interference in internal affairs. He insisted that each commune has the right to define its own identity, and that no \"centralist\" will impose social or legal norms on them."
bedzincon.7.a: "General guidelines for implementation"
bedzincon.7.b: "Coherent internal policy"
bedzincon.7.c: "Pluralist communal policies"

bedzincon.8.t: "Congress Day 4 - External Policy"
bedzincon.8.desc: "The end of day four was marked by a conference on \"foreign\" policy, intended to be pursued jointly - initially within the borders of Poland, and eventually on the international stage. A strong emphasis was placed on the notion that at the very least, externally, the alliance must appear as a united front, not as a collection of quarrelsome warlords vulnerable to classic divide-and-conquer tactics.\n\nSosnowiec stated plainly that they believe the alliance should pursue common interests as a single state, support one another in achieving shared goals, and strive to expand the Intercounty to include other states across Poland. The ultimate aim, they said, should be the formation of a Polish reunification front composed of all such aligned entities.\n\nThe delegation from Jaworzno seemed somewhat disconnected from the intended topic of discussion. Like a mantra, they repeatedly asserted that the alliance's core imperative must be the fight against fascism, and called for the creation of the broadest possible antifascist front - one that would root out every manifestation of that deadly political movement, both within and beyond their current borders.\n\nHowever, the most baffling moment came from the Dąbrowa Minister of War, who launched into a fiery speech proclaiming that it is the duty of their socialist civilization to bring about Poland's reunification on the barrels of their guns. He declared that the National People's Army, which he represents, would serve as the vanguard of a leap into the future, delivering liberation to every corner of Poland."
bedzincon.8.a: "VICTORY FOR THE WORKING PEOPLE"
bedzincon.8.b: "Common front to unite Poland"
bedzincon.8.c: "Strong anti-fascist front"

bedzincon.9.t: "Congress Day 5 - Centralization"
bedzincon.9.desc: "The final day of the Congress was the most central - in every sense of the word - moment of the entire assembly. It was then that the delegation leaders tackled the core idea behind their presence here: the potential process of centralisation, set to begin immediately following the Congress. Many observers considered reaching this point a miracle in itself, given that the talks surprisingly had managed to avoid total collapse at every preceding stage. Now, in the final stretch, the future of the alliance hangs in the balance.\n\nWłodzimierz Czarzasty laid out his vision, which, in its final form, called for the creation of a single state entity - one that would respect the autonomy of its constituent bodies but operate under a unified banner. He envisioned a true Union of Socialist Republics that would be strong and united. Although he rejected comparisons to the Soviet Union, the parallels were plain for all to see.\n\nKrzysztof Szwej, meanwhile, continued tirelessly in his role as this plenary's de facto Gomułka, asserting that only the national interest could unite everyone in the righteous goal of rebuilding the country. He argued that it is the nation - not ideology - that must be the imperative driving their efforts toward reunification. However, it remained unclear what concrete proposal Szwej was actually putting forward.\n\nMaciej Konieczny, on the other hand, voiced strong opposition, declaring that the only acceptable path was a decentralised commonwealth that would safeguard the interests of the people. He described a vision of the United Communes of the Zagłębie region as an ideal society where the rights of each minor commune are respected, and all work together toward the greater good, rather than being forced to choose the lesser evil.\n\nSo... what now?"
bedzincon.9.a: "Centralization in the national interest"
bedzincon.9.b: "Union of Polish Socialist Republics"
bedzincon.9.c: "Decentralized community of similar interest"

bedzincon.10.t: "Congress of Będzin - Conclusion"
bedzincon.10.desc: "The Second Congress of the Intercounty has just come to an end. Delegates are now mingling behind the scenes, discussing the implications of what was agreed - but all are in a state of surprise. The Congress did not end in scandal, and personal animosities were genuinely set aside. After the fiery opening speeches, the pressure seemed to lift, and - for the most part - they were able to debate both their common ground and their divisions in a constructive and professional manner.\n\nWhat does this mean? In short, a new chapter is beginning in the history of the Intercounty, which many had already written off as doomed to fracture. Perhaps, against all odds, this organism might withstand the turbulence, and once the principles of the Second Congress are implemented by the member states, they may well find themselves on the path toward building a lasting foundation - one around which other socialist factions may rally.\n\nIt also spells very bad news for the fractured factions across the region. Those who were counting on an easy grab by marching into the internally divided Dąbrowa Basin will now be met with a clenched iron fist and a united front against any would-be invader. It may well be that this Congress has sealed the region's fate - under the red banner."

For no one else, they claim, can offer them the future they seek - a future they are ready to fight for, even if it means standing alone against the entire world."

dgr_district.1.desc: "Marcin Bazylak didn't even look back. The guards had let him go-not out of mercy, but indifference. The coup was over, the National Council had declared victory, and there was no point in holding a broken man. His breath steamed in the morning air as he stumbled to his Skoda Superb, fumbled with the keys, and fired up the engine. He didn't care where he left the documents or if anyone followed him. There was only one thought in his mind: his family. Tires screeched as he turned onto the main road. Is he too late? Past the quiet buildings. Were they telling the truth? Past shuttered shops. Was it just a lie? Through the smoking ruins of last week's 'random' explosions.\n\nAt the roundabout near Katowice Steelworks, he missed the exit. His hands trembled. Sweat poured despite the cold. Somewhere between panic and instinct, he tried to turn back - too sharply, too fast. The car fishtailed. Slammed into a barrier. Metal groaned, glass cracked, and the world spun.\nSilence. Then voices.\nRough hands pulled open the driver's side door. Boots crunched gravel. Someone pulled Bazylak out, dazed and bleeding, onto the cold pavement.\n- Alive - said one of them. - Barely.\nPresident passed out. When he woke up, he was lying on the couch in some old office. Is he in the Steelworks? Standing above him was a broad-shouldered man in an old suit, with a faded red star pinned to the collar. First Secretary of the Communist Party of Poland, Krzysztof Szwej.\n- Marcin - Szwej muttered, amused. - Still running?\nBazylak tried to speak, failed, then nodded. His voice cracked. \n- I need to get my wife. My kids...\n- We'll get them - Szwej said firmly - You have more pressing issues to deal with, President.\n\nBehind the dirty window, one could see that smoke was rising across the city. The National Council had barely lasted the morning. But it was already almost sunset. The neighborhoods turned on them fast - old gang grudges, political feuds, vendettas with boots and fire. The police were gone for good. Bargieła fled west, toward Łęknice with only a handful of his loyal friends. A few minutes later, in a backroom beneath an old steelworks office, Bazylak sat with a wet rag to his head and a cup of bitter coffee in his shaking hands.\n- I can't - he whispered - I'm done. I should've left years ago.\n- You'll do what's needed - Szwej said, pacing across the room - We all will.\nHe turned to one of his men. - Find his family. Bring them here. Safe. Take three men with you. - Then he turned to Bazylak, quieter now - You were a ghost in a dead state, comrade. But now you'll help build something real.\n\nAs the steelworkers were leaving the premises to find the president's family, they saw one of their comrades raising red banners and instead of the text \"Huta Katowice\" above the gate, they proudly displayed a new one, a declaration that said:"

Dąbrowa Górnicza is a highly conflicted place, if not one outright in a state of anarchy. Gangs constantly terrorize people, holding them in an iron grip while fighting among themselves, for control of one or two more already devastated buildings. And when they came for him, Bazylak had no choice. Well, he had a choice, but he probably would have ended up hanging from a lamppost in Haller's Park. So, he decided to make a pact with the devil and establish a government of municipal unity in the most powerful steel combine in all of Poland - Katowice Steelworks. This industrial facility has now become the last bastion of municipal administration, and it has been taken over by the Communist Party of Poland. How desperate must a person be to decide to hand over power to a group of geriatric dinosaurs from a bygone era? Again, Bazylak had no choice.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone agrees with this decision, and in the industrial heart of Dąbrowa Górnicza, the government managed to gather fewer than a thousand supporters. Can such a small number of soldiers subdue a city of over a hundred thousand? They will definitely need help and skillful maneuvering between the gangs. It's time to divide and conquer."

They've maniacally expected an attack on the Coke Plant, and when that didn't happen, everyone was losing their mind as to why. They even thought we'd surrender, leave, or decide to HELP THEM. The railway station of Dąbrowa Górnicza Towarowa lay below, quiet for now, too quiet. The rebels had made it their own, stacking containers into makeshift barricades, stringing wire between signal posts, pretending that they could outlast a state. The cargo terminal here is a lung of the city. Without it, no fuel runs east, no steel rolls west. The boy-partisans don't grasp the logic of logistics. But we do. That's why we sent them a gift. Through binoculars, I watched the train crawl along the line from Katowice Steelworks. Four flatcars, a fuel cistern, and an old brown engine. All authentic. The men hidden in the engine and disguised as railwaymen had not spoken since the plan was set. Not out of fear - discipline. They let it in. Just as I predicted, the rebels were desperate for resources and arrogant enough to believe we wouldn't dare move on the yard. The engine rolled past the main switch. I could see one of them wave.\n\nI clicked the radio once.\n\nAt once, the flatcars dropped their sides and unfolded like claws. Militia sprang from compartments, already firing. The train ground to a halt inside the yard, disgorging twenty men into the stunned defenders. Simultaneously, our mortars hidden in the slag fields to the west opened fire. I had calculated the coordinates myself. The barrage cut off escape through the sidings. The rebels panicked. Their fire was wild. A fuel drum caught in the crossfire. Flames rolled through the eastern storage shed. One of their trucks tried to ram the train and was reduced to blackened wreckage before it crossed the yard.\n\nWithin six minutes, the flag was raised over the station's signal tower. Red and unburned. I did not smile. I only marked the time."

dgr_district.14.desc: "From the ridge above the Sławków freight corridor, I watched the sun glint off the steel veins of the Euroterminal. It shimmered - cold and clinical. The rebels had taken it weeks ago and turned it into their little customs kingdom, stockpiling containers of copper, spare electronics, even canned goods from God knows where. But Sławków is already ours. This is only the last place of defiance. They thought they were merchants now. Little loot goblins, lords of rust. But there is no room for lords in the Popular Front.\n\nOur train approached the gate slowly - just as planned. To the defenders, it was nothing but another civilian freight run, a battered locomotive towing six flatcars. No guns visible. No escort. No resistance. I had given the order that morning. No rebels left alive. No warnings. No negotiations. This is not a war for hearts, but for critical infrastructure. And also, those separatists deserve worse. The rebels gathered on the gantry crane, gesturing lazily, rifles slung over their backs. That moment - that fatal moment of confidence - is when we opened the coffin.\n\nThe flatcars split open like blistered skin, and the kamikaze drones emerged like hornets. Simple, cheap, made from agricultural sprayers and soldered rotors. But they were loaded with makeshift explosives and vengeance. I watched through my scope as the swarm arced into the sky, then dived. One, two, five - dozens. Explosions rippled across the gantry. Steel screamed. Rebels fled like rats through container corridors. One drone plunged directly into the customs office. Another sliced through the cab of a pickup as it reversed toward the north gate.\n\nThen came the men. Two dozen storm troops leapt from the cars and advanced under cover of the chaos. Shouting like a band of soviet shock troops from WW2. No mercy. One squad secured the warehouse, another the tracks. By the time the flames licked the southern fencing, the terminal was ours.\n\nProgress, finally."

I slipped trying to flank, rolled into the basin, and when I got up, I was alone.\n\nWell, not quite alone. Something was moving in there with me. I heard it first - soft footfalls on gravel, then silence. A shadow shifting behind rebar. Not a conscript. Not one of those drugged-up street rebels. This one was careful. Patient. I caught a glimpse once - painted face, light gear, rifle with a hunting scope. Professional. A hunter.\n\nAnd apparently, I was the game. I crouched, trying to calm my breath, scanning every broken pipe, every thicket of nettles. My rifle felt heavier by the second. Every twig snap made me flinch. He was circling me. I knew it. I could almost feel his eyes on the back of my neck. Then I saw it - movement, thirty meters ahead. I raised my weapon, finger tightening.\n\nAnd then came the snort. A wild boar. Big. Ugly. It burst from the undergrowth to my right, just as the shot cracked from the trees. Not aimed at me. The hunter fired at the boar. Instinct or panic, I'll never know. I leapt up, swung my rifle toward the muzzle flash and fired. Once. Twice. The second shot hit. A dull thump. A body fell from the perch above, crashing through brittle branches and landing hard in the dust below.\n\nI didn't move at first. I waited, gun shaking in my hands. The boar was gone. The hunter wasn't moving. I approached. He was older. Calm face. Almost serene. I took his rifle, then turned away, heart pounding."

The anarchists had either been wiped out or had surrendered and been carted off to Huta Katowice for a round of mandatory reeducation. At this point, even the word ideology was being bent so far out of shape it would put the traffic roundabout in Będzin to shame. Here he was - a nationalist at heart - leading a platoon of like-minded youths, some more ideologically committed than others, capturing the anarchist stronghold in Ząbkowice side by side with hardened, socialist workers of the People's Front.\n\nEven the best mathematician wouldn't be able to find a common denominator in this mess. But a deal is a deal. As he watched Front troops looting what little there was left in the Big Squat, Aleksander wondered if he and his men would become the next targets of this cold-blooded, pragmatic alliance. He had already ordered his boys west, to secure the Young Steelworkers housing estate. If the communists turned on them, at least they'd have defensible ground.\n\nWatching the bustle, his eyes fell on two young people's commissars inspecting one of the rooms - faces twisted in disgust. It was likely used for hedonistic orgies, drunken benders... or both. Aleksander smirked. So pious, like they'd just walked out of church. So young, like they'd just left school. And already serving the regime so loyally. Just like him now. And who was he, then, to moralize? A sellout, a traitor, the butcher of a red regime. Where does pragmatism end?\n\nBargieła snapped out of it. Doubts were useless now. There was a path ahead - and he had to walk it. Even if it led through a purgatory of sacrifice and contradiction."

Tiles cracked, bullet holes in the walls, and dried blood still staining the corners no one thinks to clean. But I do. I always did. This used to be a good block, full of decent people. Everyone always used to say \"Good Morning\" to me. Old Mr. Łuczak lived on the third floor - retired miner, always had mints for the kids. He died in the first blackout. His heart gave out. No elevator. I found him slumped on the stairs, like he just sat down for a rest.\n\nFourth floor - Kasia and Tomek. Young couple with two daughters. The girls drew chalk suns on the walls. I never had the heart to scrub them off. The last time I saw them, Kasia had a knife tucked into her belt and eyes like stone. They disappeared in the first turf war when the Broadway gangs tried to claim Manhattan. Never found the bodies. Sixth floor - occupied now by a Popular Front field office. But before, it was squatters. I remember a boy there, no older than sixteen, with shaking hands and a makeshift rifle. He called me \"grandma\", even though I'm no one's. He bled out in the stairwell after the reconquest. Tried to hold them off. For what, I don't know.\n\nThe Popular Front soldiers nod to me now. They don't see the ghosts. They think they've reclaimed the block. But the walls remember. I hear them creak at night, like they're still settling into the silence after screams. I mop and scrub.

Haller's Park. The park where my parents would go every Sunday for a walk. I saw the tree that my girlfriend and I carved our initials into. \"M+P, 2012\". It's still there, barely visible from under ash and soot. We moved past the old playground - swings rusted, trees half-burned from the firebombings. I used to race my brother there after school. He was always faster. I broke from the squad when I saw the block. Building 6, middle staircase, the one before the small pine tree. Home. I ran ahead, heart hammering. Third floor. Apartment 91. I still remember the code to the door. Inside, it smelled like mold, dust, and something worse.\n\nThey were there.\nDad in the living room.. Mom in the kitchen. And Maciek... my little brother...\nThey were all there, as always.\nDead.\n\nI fell to my knees. I don't know how long I stayed there. Someone called for me on the radio. I didn't answer. I thought that I should cry. I couldn't. There were supposed to be feelings, questions, bargaining, despair. Any stage of grief. §tANYTHING.§!\nNothing. After what I thought was eternity, I pulled myself out of the apartment. Down there, I saw our platoon with some prisoners. Gangsters. One of them I knew. We went to school together. Krystian. He saw me and smirked.\n\nAnd there it was.\n§tSOMETHING.§!\n\nI don't know if the words I've screamed were even in my language. I roared. I dragged him to his knees. I started beating the shit out of him, and when he was lying bloodied on the ground, only then I pulled my pistol. I didn't ask any questions, I didn't care if he was the one who did it. I needed §tJUSTICE.§! My hands began to shake. My vision blurred with tears. A comrade tried to pull me back. Shouting. Orders. I didn't hear them. All I could see were the bodies in that apartment, and the memory of two little kids who used to laugh together all the time.

Mydlice had always been a grey forest of blocks, but now it was a forest on fire, every window a potential barrel, every corridor a grave. From the landing on the 9th, I could see them - five of them - holed up behind a barricade of washing machines and shattered furniture on the 10th. One had a hunting rifle. Another held what looked like a homemade bomb, duct tape and nails wrapped around a gas canister.\n- Back off or we take the whole fucking floor with us! - shouted one of the gangsters.\nTheir flag, some old gang tag spray-painted on a sheet, flapped from the barricade. My CO, Lieutenant Rak, stepped out just enough to be seen, no helmet, arms raised.\n- Hey guys...don't shoot! You don't have to do this anymore - he said, voice calm like a teacher - It's over. We hold Mydlice now. There is no point in losing any more young lives to whatever this is.\n\nThe gangsters didn't answer. Probably hadn't seen sunlight in weeks. Probably didn't care anymore. Rak kept talking, buying time.\n- Look, we don't have to fight! You must be starving there, there is plenty of food in the city for all of us! You won't go to prison, I promise.\n- Joke's on you. We don't have any prisons. You'll just die - I thought.\nMeanwhile, Mikołaj and Antek were already crawling up the elevator shaft like ghosts. We could hear them above us with the occasional scrape of metal. The gang leader shouted again.\n- BETTER DEAD THAN RED!\nThen everything that could go wrong, it went wrong. The elevator cable let out a screech - rust or pressure, who knows. A voice above shrieked:\n- They're in the shaft. TORCH THEM!\nGunfire exploded. The floor shook. Someone dropped a Molotov down the elevator - flames whooshed up like a hell pit. Antek screamed. Mikołaj didn't even bother. Just went down. It was too late, but our CO ordered the breach. We managed to blow the barricade and poured into the floor. I was lucky to be in the rear. Because when we entered the last apartments, I was first in line. Smoke. Screams. Blood. One gangster was shooting blindly, eyes shut, praying. Another clutched a dead man, crying and firing a pistol with one hand. In the chaos, I saw the bomb - two gas canisters, wrapped in nails, timer blinking. I screamed. We immediately bolted. Down the stairs. Some didn't make it in time. I remember the sound - not like in the movies. Not one explosion. More like the block exhaling fire. The tenth floor blew out in a rain of glass and body parts.\n\nBack outside, covered in ash, I looked up at the blackened ruin.

dgr_district.20.desc: "Piekło (lit. Hell) Colony. This meeting was never supposed to happen. And yet, the leadership of the Łęknica Inquisition and the People's Front brought things to a point where nationalists were negotiating with communists. You could say - given the name of the settlement - that hell hath frozen over. On one side stood Aleksander Bargieła - leader of the nationalist militias who, over the past weeks, had gained significant ground in the never-ending gang war, pressing the Young Steelworkers hard and capturing Antoniów. On the other, Krzysztof Szwej - figurehead of the neo-communists from the People's Front faction, claiming legitimacy as the true city government. Mainly because they'd managed to capture the last mayor, Marcin Bazylak, and added him to their cabinet like some kind of Pokémon.\n\nOne - young and ambitious. He believed history had smiled on him, granting enough support to enter this warlike election for the future of Poland. The other - old and patient. He had waited nearly forty years for the opportunity to lead Poland back into the arms of communist revolution.\n- Comrade Bargieła, I'm glad you decided to attend this meeting. It is a momentous occasi... -  Szwej began, using his usual drowsy tone.\n- What's in it for me? - Bargieła cut him off mid-sentence - Mister Comrade should remember where he is. I don't care for ideological formalities. The fact I didn't come here to shoot you should be enough proof of interest. I know what you want - an army. I've got one. But what guarantees do I have? - The young man wouldn't let himself be bored to death with speeches. But that kind of negotiation style doesn't always work in every situation. Szwej's expression suddenly hardened, as if he dropped a mask.\n- Full command of the entire People's Front army, if you join us. Time for unity is now.\n\nThis time it was Bargieła who froze. Full command of the army? Either this was pure desperation - or a perfectly crafted trap. Still, it was the kind of offer that stroked his famously massive ego. So many opportunities... and just as many risks. He wasn't a seasoned politician. This game could cost him his life if Szwej outmaneuvered him. But if he didn't fall into the trap - his men would follow him, whether with God or the Devil. They could win Poland.\n- My soldiers - I don't want them indoctrinated. Our units stay autonomous. No political commissars - Bargieła replied cautiously.\n- Agreed - Szwej answered without the slightest hesitation.\nThat worried Aleksander even more. You don't trust a man who doesn't even try to haggle. But in the end, the young rebel trusted more in his own ability and infallibility than he feared the old communist. He couldn't shake the glorious vision of a national revolution rising from the ruins of the old system - led by him, commander of the armed forces. He'll worry about ideology later. After a moment of thought, Bargieła reached out his hand and said:\n- Then... Comrade. Socialism or death."

The brass plate with his name - scratched through. Someone had tried to pry it off. He opened the door slowly. Dust drifted in shafts of sunlight through shattered blinds. The chair had been overturned. Papers scattered. His old coat still hung on the stand in the corner, riddled with moth holes. He stepped inside like a man entering a tomb. He was away for a few months. And it looked like he was gone for decades.\n\nThe Popular Front's flag now hung where the city's crest once did. Bright red. Proud. Socialist. He sat behind the desk. The chair creaked with familiar complaint. His name wasn't on the paperwork anymore - he was no longer president. He was \"just\" the First Minister. Still, it was a responsible position. Maybe even too similarly to his old one. A social democrat, dressed in the red coat of the communists. But someone had to keep this goddamned machine turning. Outside, a burst of shouting - Front patrol sweeping the building again. It was safe. Relatively. They had secured Reden block by block, but holdouts remained. You could still hear gunfire some nights.\n\nHe found a surviving ledger and flipped it open. Water damage, half the names smudged. Permits. Housing requests. Complaints from citizens long dead. He took a pen. It worked. One of the secretaries stepped in - a girl maybe twenty, with a Kalashnikov slung across her back.\n- Comrade Minister - she said, with a barely noticeable hint of mockery - We need signatures for food ration distribution.\nHe nodded. No ceremony, no civility. Just tasks. As he signed, he glanced out the window. Smoke still curled from distant rooftops. The steelworks were operational again, trains running under armed guard. Korczaka and Majakowski streets had power for four hours a day. It was a start.\n\nHe exhaled slowly. No victory parade.

Too quiet for a city of nearly a hundred thousand souls. You'd expect something - footsteps, market shouts, even an argument. But all I hear is the wind brushing the broken glass beneath the tram lines and the faint thrum of a diesel generator humming somewhere down by the city hall. This is what Dąbrowa Górnicza has become. A city holding its breath. Sometimes I sit in this office for hours and convince myself that the silence means order. That maybe - just maybe - things are stabilizing. That the Intercounty and our city will hold. Sosnowiec says they're organizing new security patrols. Whatever's left of them - they keep promising humanitarian corridors and clean supply routes. They send maps with arrows and stamps and notes written in polite language. They mean well, I think. People always thought that Dąbrowa was in Silesia. In the voivodeship, yes. But we were never Silesians. They made sure of that.\n\nOur police station still has a dozen officers. Most of them don't leave the building anymore. They answer the radio if they're in the mood, but it's mostly for noise - to remind themselves they still exist. They don't go into Mydlice or Gołonóg. No one does. Those districts belong to others now. Manhattan Crew runs the housing blocks up north. Down in Reden, it's all in the hands of some gang called the Crank Kings — meth labs, chop shops, backroom clinics that charge in ammunition or tramadol. There are rumors that the Ziobro's raiders are trying to push into the area. I can't keep track anymore. I get reports. Or rather, frightened scribbles from residents pretending to be reports. They're mostly stories:\n- Someone saw a man shot at the Pogoria. Which one?\n- A woman in the Gołonóg market was dragged off for selling out of someone's turf. Why?\n- The smoke over the coke plant wasn't an accident. What happened?\n\nBut I tell myself it's just temporary. That the Intercounty will send reinforcements soon. That this is what a transition looks like. That we just need to ride out the storm. Only, the storm isn't here yet. That's the part that keeps me up. The city hasn't fallen. Not entirely.

They came from the edge of Haller's Park, where weeds had long since claimed the walkways. On their way, they picked up their fuel truck. It was liquid gold these days, and no one knows how they got their hands on it. Finally, the metal gates of the Sztygarka Museum creaked open.\n\nAleksander Bargieła stepped out first.\nHe was young-barely older than the boys behind him - but his voice carried the weight of someone who believed history had given him permission and his time was just now. Clad in a tattered green field jacket, he raised his arm, and the group followed. They moved fast. Everyone could see them out in the open on the square next to the building, and there they were - two beautiful tanks, and a lot of other military equipment. Preserved, barely functional. But functional enough. It took time for the two specialists to figure out the controls and the rest to refuel the tanks. And then, the morning quiet suddenly died. The roar of the engines shattered the calm atmosphere. Pigeons scattered from the rooftops, and the first flickers of light appeared in apartment windows across downtown. People looked out. No one said a word. Yet everyone smiled.\n\nThe tanks turned into Rose Alley. And then right onto what had once been the main street of Dąbrowa - bustling with life and commerce. Now it was cracked asphalt, burned trash, and empty bus stops. The rumble of steel tracks echoed off the buildings like thunder. Children peeked from behind curtains. Their parents pulled them back. No one came outside. No one stopped them. No one dared to. It was like Bargieła thought - those who are brave enough to claim the day will rewrite the history of this world.\nAt the corner of Graniczna Street, two of the smaller transporters that they also captured slowed. Its hatch opened, and a few dozen boys with improvised weapons climbed out and surrounded the police station. They stayed there, unmoving, harrowing. But the others rolled on.\n\nAt city hall, Bazylak was already awake. He'd heard the noise. Seen the glow from his office window. He didn't call the security, as there was no one left. Didn't try to run. He knew someone would come. He just stood behind his desk, waiting. The tanks didn't fire. They parked at the entrance like they were there to pick up someone. Bargieła and two others marched up the stairs and into the building. Minutes later, Bazylak sat with a pen in his hand, staring at the paper.\n- It's just a formality - Bargieła said calmly. - You sign. Then you're done. No harm. No exile. We're not animals. And if you won't, my men are already watching your house. Your family. So, no heroics.\nBazylak didn't argue. He wanted to be a hero, but he couldn't do anything. The silence outside spoke louder than anything he could say. The city had made its choice - or at least, stopped caring. He signed. By noon, a photocopy of the paper was taped to the city hall door. Above it, someone had scrawled in thick black ink:"
dgr.2.a: "NATIONAL CITY COUNCIL OF DĄBROWA GÓRNICZA"

dgr.3.t: "Cabinet of Curiosities"
dgr.3.desc: "The room smelled faintly of damp concrete and old paper. The chairs didn't match, the lights flickered, and you could occasionally hear some loud sounds. Sometimes they were explosions, and sometimes just the sound of the machinery. Kaja sat near the corner, and the clack of her typewriter was already echoing off the walls of the half-burnt office in the Steelworks they now called the Hall of the Popular Council. The name felt like a joke. It's just a ruined office. She wasn't anyone important - just a secretary for the Popular Front, drafted from the administration office of the clinic next to the steelworks. They needed someone \"with clean hands\" to take the minutes. She was clean, alright. Clean and quietly bitter.\n\nThe first to arrive was Krzysztof Szwej. Geriatric, coughing into his sleeve, smelling of mothballs and ideology. She remembered him from the 1st May parades, waving flags and babbling about proletarian rebirth while the tram ticket price tripled. Next came Marcin Bazylak. Once president, now a diminished persona with sunken eyes and oversized suit. Kaja's aunt worked in the city office under him, unpaid for six months, surviving on expired canned goods. Now he was a \"minister\". Minister of what? Regret?\n\nBas Tajpan entered like a rap star - gold chains, dreads, flashing a peace sign. \"Comrades\", he said with a grin. She remembered the basement parties in Broadway and the shady deals. He used to run with gangsters before rebranding as a \"grassroots social democrat\". Doctor Zbigniew Podraza followed, calm as always. Kaja remembered her mother sitting for hours in line under his administration, just to be told there was no doctor that day. She eventually passed away because nobody would take care of her. Dying grounds. That's what they called an emergency ward under his rule.\n\nThen there was a man in uniform. The police officer. Kaja didn't recognize him, but the badge on his chest made her uneasy. Someone whispered he used to run internal investigations. She wondered how many bodies he walked over to get here. They all nodded to each other like old friends, like survivors of a shipwreck. Maybe they were. Perhaps we're all in one now. She typed as they spoke of reconstruction, of unity, of \"building a new Dąbrowa Górnicza from the ashes\". But as long as they were blabbering, they couldn't even agree on what kind of coffee they wanted. Not like there was anything but the cheapest stuff. She typed through their posturing, their big plans, their confusing speeches, where every next one contradicted the former ones. She typed and wondered how many more lives they'd ruin before the dust settles. Outside, a siren wailed. Somewhere, someone was still fighting.\n\nAnd in this room, they dared to call themselves a government. They don't govern. They command."

dgr.4.t: "Community Interview"
dgr.4.desc: "Marcin Bazylak sat in the hallway like a student who'd gotten into trouble and was waiting outside the principal's office. He looked completely out of his depth, his round, boyish face marked with honest confusion. That wouldn't have been such a problem - if not for the fact that he was here as an emissary from Dąbrowa, sent to speak with Włodzimierz Czarzasty himself. Szwej had sent him simply because Bazylak belonged to the New Left and had some connection with the leader of Sosnowiec. His task was to negotiate aid for Dąbrowa to help them reclaim control over the city. Quietly, Bazylak started muttering the points he had to raise during the conversation. The recent events had taken a toll on him. At some point, a young secretary stepped out of one of the offices and addressed the former mayor directly, inviting him inside. Bazylak took a deep breath and walked in as confidently as he could in that moment. But all the energy he'd built up drained from him instantly when he saw that Czarzasty was not there.\n\nInstead, sitting in his place was his deputy, Anna Maria Żukowska. A cold sweat washed over Bazylak. Though there had never been any bad blood between them, Żukowska had a reputation as the Iron Lady of the Left. Or, as some unkind tongues liked to say, a cold-hearted bitch.\n- Marcin - she greeted him - It's good to see that Dąbrowa still has someone left to send.\nHe tried to shake her hand, but she didn't offer hers and gestured toward the chair. Bazylak attempted to outline the Popular Front's request - aid in retaking southern districts and Mydlice, fuel shipments, maybe even a battalion of their \"volunteer militia\". He kept it polite, practical, yet he did sound desperate. Żukowska listened patiently, nodding, tilting her head like she would inspect a stray dog. But she counted every time he added something to the never-ending list of pleas. At some point, she just raised her hand, telling him to shut up. And he did.\n- I read your reports. Quite the mess you've made. And I'm just about curious to hear how you've managed to lose your seat to some old geezer from the previous era. Tragic, really. But those are your problems. And tell me, why...should we suffer from your failures? - Żukowska exclaimed calmly while sipping her tea.\n- B-but...the Intercounty, the alliance! - Bazylak started panicking\n- t-t-he aLLiAncE - she mocked him - Come on. You want volunteers, gasoline, and weapons. And what do we get? Another broken city, run by an aging communist and a choir of burned-out bureaucrats? We've got Będzin for that niche. If you are not able to pull your weight in this partnership, we're not going to rescue you every time you cry for mommy. Get. Your. Shit. Together. And come back when we can talk as equals. For now, the case is closed. I'm sorry for all that it's worth. Really.\nBazylak, as the good pupil he is, nodded, bowed his head slightly, and left. Outside, the cold hit him like a slap. Back at home, Szwej would ask if they agreed to help. And Bazylak would lie."

dgr.5.desc: "- Comrade Krępa, go do your reggae-hiphop thing, calm 'em down. Maybe they'll listen if you talk like one of them.\nEasier said than done. Zielona. A beautiful park turned into a permanent drug rave with a suspicious amount of fog. I rolled in mid-evening. Air was thick with smoke and pine. Someone was riding a bicycle with no wheels. A half-naked girl painted in glitter whispered to a tree. Three guys argued about whether Żabka was a capitalist psyop or a reptilian brand. The stage? Made from pallets and an old Żuk truck. My kind of place. I climbed up, lit a joint someone handed me, grabbed a mic hooked up to a speaker and started talking.\n- Peace, brothers. Front wants ya to disband. Go home. Babylon is gone, reintegrate with your homies in da city.\nSomeone booed. A goat bleated. I panicked and rapped something about unity and ganja and Dąbrowa districts. It rhymed, but didn't make sense. They loved it. People screamed. Why? A fire dancer set part of his pants on fire and called it \"performance\". I saw a guy trying to eat a vinyl record. A kid with no shoes handed me \"spice tea\" in a cracked Hello Kitty mug. I drank. Shouldn't have. Next thing I know, I'm conducting a wedding between two dudes and a broken satellite dish. Someone claimed they saw John Paul II in the smoke. I believed them. Suddenly, it's a parade. People started following me out of Camp Zielona. No plan. Just vibes. I think I yelled something like:\n- Let's go bring the bass back to the city, my lions!\n\nAnd they followed. Almost a hundred high lunatics, two goats, three dogs, and a guy with a broken didgeridoo who kept playing anyway. Some carried tiki torches made from broom handles and lube-soaked rags. One guy wore a tent like a cape. We hit the main road. But man, feet aching and stomachs rumbling and suddenly vibes turn from revolution to satan's invention - munchies. We made it maybe half a kilometer before the rest started complaining. Even I start feeling it. The revolution can wait, but the munchies? Nooo, brother. That's war.\n- Oy, Bas, where's the food ministry at, man?\nSo there we are, midnight outside the main railway station, the rave of Camp Zielona now turned into the People's Snack March. Whole commune of hunger, high as soviet satellites, planning next move. And I, Bas Tajpan, chosen by fate, look to the stars and ask:\n- Haile Selassie, tell me is there still a kebab open in the centre?\nNo answer. Only wind. And the distant rumble of a hungry future. I looked around at my glittery, confused followers. The revolution paused. Our eyes met, red and glassy.\n- There's a burger shack in Reden, I think - I mumbled.\n- I WANT A KEBAB, OH MY GOD, I WOULD MAKE LOVE TO SOME FUCKING BIG ROLLO WITH FRIES RIGHT NOOOOW\nAnd so, the house was divided. They're all looking at me for guidance. And I will lead them to the promised land! WITH ME, TO MORDOR."

dgr.6.desc: "Papaj never thought the day would come when he'd pray for a blackout. But now, crouched behind a broken fridge in his cluttered Reden apartment, sweat pouring down his face, he begged the gods of short circuits and blown fuses for mercy. He had always been a small fish with big dreams. The nickname Papaj stuck from his teenage years - someone said he looked like a Polish Popeye, with wiry arms and a crooked grin. The grin had faded. Now he just looked like a junkie with a shovel and a guilty conscience.\n\nThe Popular Front's troops rolled through the district three days ago. At first, he thought it was just another gang switching flags. But these guys had uniforms, megaphones, patrol schedules - and worse, people's commissars. Real pencil pushers with clipboards and a love for surprise inspections. Papaj's problem was upstairs. Two hydroponic setups, three kilos drying in the attic, and a stash buried under the tile floor of the bathroom.\n- I'm fucked - he muttered, pacing. - I'm so fucked.\nHe tried to burn the plants. Neighbors saw the smoke. He said it was a microwave fire. Dumb lie. Then he tried to dig up the stash, but the shovel hit the tile like a gong.\n- Shit! Shit! Quiet!\n\nEvery noise felt like a siren, and every voice outside like a patrol coming up the stairs. He'd managed to flush some, bury the rest in a trash bag behind the tenement. But it was too late. Word spread fast. Someone saw the lights. Someone saw the smoke. Someone always did. That evening, the intercom crackled.\n- Citizen Matejski? Open the door. People's Commissariat. We'd like to have a word.\nHis hands trembled. He looked at the shattered tile, the bag of half-burnt stalks in the sink, and the cash stuffed in cereal boxes.\n- Uhm...a moment! I'm taking a shit! - he barked, voice cracking.\nAnd then, salvation: the lights cut out. A district-wide blackout. The hum of the fridge died. Everything went still.\n\nHe didn't move. Minutes passed. Maybe they left. He started grinning again, like he outsmarted the KGB itself. Like he is...- The door burst open. Lights cut through the dark.\n- On the floor! Now! - A boot slammed into his ribs. The cereal box burst open. Coins rained down like confetti.\n- Medicinal - he whimpered, curled up. - It's medicinal.\n- Yeah? - One of the officers grunted. - I'm glad you're not even denying.\nAs they dragged him out past his front door, Papaj caught the smell of burnt plastic and crushed weed. The blackout didn't save him.\n\nIt just meant they brought flashlights."

dgr.7.t: "Kwisatz Haderach"
dgr.7.desc: "I am the messenger sent eastward. The instrument, not the hand. The observer, yet never the unobserved. I am Aleksander Bargieła. We were learning that the desert was broken. But deserts are never broken. They merely await the breaking of those who step into them. The First Secretary bade me to \"deal with\" the Pharaohs. Rein them in, he had said. As if they were wild horses. As if power in the sands could be shackled by dialectics and rifles. When I arrived at Błędów, I found no gang. I found a rite. Sand as pale as bone stretched to every edge of vision, shimmering under the weight of ancient heat. The Pharaohs walked it barefoot, unarmed, unhurried - men and women adorned in rusted medals, stripped circuitboards, and linen soaked in spice. Melange. The whisper-word. The dust-of-memory. They offered it to me in silence, pressed into my palm like a sacrament. I hesitated. Then I partook.\n\nAnd in the taking, I was taken.\n\nThe spice unfolded the false continuity of time. Past became skin, future became sand. My heartbeat lost its origin and began to echo not from my chest - but from beneath the ground.\nThe worm stirs. First tremor. Then rhythm. Then sound - not heard, but felt in the teeth and spine. The sand parted. A behemoth rose: no eyes, no mercy, no reason. A god of motion and hunger. A hunger so old it felt like the voice of time itself. The Sand One. Its presence imposed meaning upon everything. The Pharaoh beside me spoke with a voice that was not merely his own:\n- You have heard it now. You know the price of stepping here.\n- I come from the city. But I bring no chains. I came to bring law, a liberation. - I said. He smiled. Not with lips, but with a stillness deeper than silence.\n- There is no law here but resonance. No authority but that which the sand allows. No return to the city you came from. You are now of us, or of nothing. The worm dove. The ground swallowed it like memory. I closed my eyes and saw the crimson sun, the ghost cities half-buried in dunes, the salt bones of the old world. The Fall. And in that vision, I felt something... alignment.\nThe desert was not lawless. It was merely beyond our vocabulary.\n- There is no going back. There is only becoming.\nAnd I became. A fraction of mysticism incorporated in this vessel. And in this moment, they all saw me as Him. The voice from the outer world. Now...I'm the one pointing the way. And upon thee, I DEMAND:\n- You have walked the broken bones of Poland. You have tasted rust in your mouths, and ash in your water. You have buried fathers in sand too dry to grieve. And now you will follow. Not as servants. Not as pawns of red banners or rusted ideologies. But as stewards of flame and sand, as keepers of the new covenant - written not on paper, but on wind-scoured stone. WE SHALL BECOME REBORN IN THE ASHES OF OUR DESERT. OUR BŁĘDÓW. OUR DUNE."

dgr.8.t: "Ideological Interpretation"
dgr.8.desc: "The Civic Reeducation and Unity Centre for Sławków was located behind walls of poured concrete, adorned with murals of red stars, cogs, wheat, and the rising sun of Dąbrowa Górnicza. Loudspeakers played The Internationale every hour, on the hour. People's Commissar Kordian Żmuda believed in repetition. He believed in rhythm, slogans, and the truth told enough times to overwrite memory.\n- Citizens of Sławków - he began each day in the main assembly - you are not prisoners. You are patients. You were infected for your whole life by this bloodthirsty illusion. A vision of freedom and capitalism. But we all fell from the consequences of those. We all sit in a destroyed state because of it. And yet, you cling to it like a moth to a light.\nŻmuda's voice dripped with confidence and warmth\n- You were taught that Sławków was independent. That you stood apart. But you were abandoned. Who fed you when the markets failed? Who protected you when the gangs came?\nHe gestured to the red banner hanging above them: DĄBROWA GÓRNICZA - OUR MOTHER.\n- It was our City. The People's Will. Not capital. Not elections. Us.\nBehind him, a film reel played. Children waving red flags. A parade of tractors. Laughing nurses. A steelworker with missing teeth hugging a commissar in tears.\n- Socialism, comrades, is not theory. It is deliverance. You suffer because you resisted your own salvation.\n\nEvery hour had a purpose. Morning: Collective Reflection, with assigned guilt-sharing. Midday: Labor Therapy - sorting screws or painting pro-Front slogans on scrap metal. Evening: the Red Circle, where everyone could watch some movies and shows together (meticulously selected by censors) and reflect upon them using a critical theory.\n- What is selfishness? - Żmuda asked one boy.\n- Crime against the collective - came the whispered reply.\n- And what is Sławków without Dąbrowa?\n- Dust... and shame.\nŻmuda nodded.\n- Truth is a burden, comrades. But under socialism, you never carry it alone. And you never walk alone. In that knowledge, in that understanding - there is strength.\n\nAfter two weeks, most requested to wear armbands bearing the hammer-and-lightning. Some even asked for roles in the New Reconstruction Battalion. Not all were convinced, but most were exhausted. And exhaustion was the seed of obedience."

Krzysztof Szwej sat at the head, hunched forward, the sleeves of his commissar's jacket rolled up. A battered ashtray overflowed beside him. Across the table, Minister of Economy - Zbigniew Podraza, scribbled figures into a stained notebook.\n- He's summoning us like subjects, - Szwej muttered, not looking up.\n- Czarzasty is a control freak. - Podraza replied. - He wouldn't suddenly announce a great congress if it weren't for his need for political machinations and spreading his influence on the rest of the alliance.\nThe Intercounty Congress, officially a \"cooperative gathering of regional partners\", had been called by Włodzimierz Czarzasty under extraordinary circumstances. But unity meant consolidation. And consolidation meant Sosnowiec swallowing Dąbrowa whole.\n- Do you know him personally? - Szwej finally asked.\n- I had this pleasure. Back when I was still the city's president. - Podraza said simply. - We saw each other mostly during the campaigns. You know, when he needed to show himself here for the voters. But what he was doing inside the party before the Fall...we're walking on thin ice here. Why not send Bazylak? Their relations are...more recent.\nSzwej smirked.\n- Bazylak has his uses, but i don't believe in his determination. If if wanted for Czarzasty to play him like a violin, i would just sign the act of annexation by the Sosnowiec instead.\n- True, but maybe that's the way, - Podraza said with a thin smile. - Let them see him meek. Then have us slide in the demands. It'll look like a compromise.\n- Besides, there will be Antifa there. We will need some heavy guns. Even if we look like we're attacking them straight ahead.\n- Don't tell me you think about...\n- Bargieła is not some communist lapdog. That's his problem - yes. But he's a patriot. He'll fight for our cause, we simply need to call \"national\" everything that we used to call \"socialist\", and he'll dive into the empty pool without even asking...\n- Alright then. Military, check. Economy, check. You take the rest. They will want to pressure us into something. We should play like economists. He opens with unity, you counter with coordination. He suggests centralization, you propose resource-sharing. Soft terms. Harmless terms.\n- But overall, we stall.\n- We stall.\nSzwej stood up and walked to the window. Beyond the shattered skyline, smog rolled over Mydlice. The Popular Front banners still held above the roofs, but barely.\n- If they try to dissolve us... - Szwej began.\n- They won't, - Podraza said. - But if they do, we walk.

Mostly because there were days when the resources simply weren't on site, but the workers had to be. The foreman, Bolek \"Kaktus\" Wyrzykowski, was already two beers in when the clock hit 22:00. He leaned back in the shift office, chain-smoking under the \"OSH - Our Priority\" poster that had been burned through by a flying angle grinder last month.\n- Relax, guys, tonight we hit the quotas or die trying - he declared, raising another beer in toast.\n- We ain't got any fucking coal! - screamed Leszek from the furnace hall - Are we supposed to heat the steel with your fucking balls?\n- Rubber burns hot, no? Soviet magic, I swear. It's not like you have gas for your wheels. Come on!\nAt furnace six, Paweł \"Mario\" Kalinowski had plugged his phone into the emergency panel to charge it. It caused a minor blackout in the rolling mill. Nobody cared.\n- Music makes the steel flow better, - he justified, blasting some local inaudible rap from a Bluetooth speaker duct-taped to his helmet. Somewhere near the smelting section, Krzysiek and Bartek were racing forklifts. One of them clipped a pallet of scrap and spilled it like confetti.\nAround 3:00 a.m., a guy none of them knew, but who had apparently been working there \"since the '80s,\" emerged from under the main converter and asked if anyone had seen his keys.\n- You've been under there for eight hours?! - someone asked.\n- I live here now, - he answered solemnly.\n\nBy 4:00, a crane got stuck in reverse and was slowly dragging a ladle of molten steel in a perfect circle. Kaktus just watched it spin, puffing his cigarette.\n- It's symbolic, - he said. - Like life.\nAt 5:20, a new worker named Damian panicked and hit the general alarm, thinking it was the coffee machine. The entire night shift evacuated to the parking lot and smoked nervously in high-vis jackets while waiting for fire trucks to arrive, then after almost half an hour, they realized that there still wasn't any fire brigade in the town. Seeing as everything was technically fine, they came back inside.\nBy 6:00, production logs were forged, burnt, or both.\nKaktus signed off the shift report with a barely legible scrawl and one last statement:\n- Another beautiful night with productivity of 179%.

The last patrol had reported nothing but burned storefronts and the smell of piss in the stairwells. But someone - probably some idiot commissar in the Central Command - gave both the 3rd Platoon of Łęknice Inquisition and the 1st Platoon of 2nd Red Banner Battalion orders to \"secure the area\". Two units. One city block. And a long-standing grudge between them. Communists and nationalists didn't trust each other. They'd fought side by side during the worst days of the reconquest, sure - but no one forgot the slurs, the insults, the songs, the whole damn history. They met outside the boarded-up Lewiatan. Ten men on each side. Red armbands on the left. Black armbands with red lightning on the right.\n\n- Oi! This is our patrol zone - said Corporal Cichy from the 3rd Platoon, arms crossed, chin up.\n- Bullshit. We were assigned here this morning - replied Sergeant Żwirecki, already chewing his lip. For a few seconds, it was just words. Then someone mentioned Wujek Mine '82. Then someone laughed. Then someone called someone a traitor. Then someone else asked if they'd like to repeat Katyń. A rifle was raised - only for show - but the other side didn't read it that way. The gunshot was an accident. A twitch, maybe. A flinch. Private Szczęsny of the Inquisition fell backward like a sack of flour. Hit in the neck. Died before anyone could scream. Nobody moved. Except Żwirek, who knelt down and screamed until he had no breath. Then everyone moved at once. Weapons were cocked. Someone yelled for revenge. Someone else started calling for backup.\n\nIt was about to go nuclear. And then, like they were god-sent, one lone patrol of Military Police arrived. There were only three officers, but they didn't care - they rolled in fast and hard. Lights on. Speakers barking orders. Soldiers looked flabbergasted.\n- PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS. NOW.\n- LIE ON THE GROUND. FACE DOWN.\nThe MPs didn't ask twice. They started pulling people from each side, cuffed them, slammed them on the pavement. Major Kulesza stepped into the middle of the street. He looked down at the body, then looked at the silent crowd.\n- You idiots realize you're on the same side? Friendly fire...only in this fucking city.\nNo one answered. He took off his gloves, lit a cigarette.\n- One dead. Over what? Colors on a damn armband? Talk about unity...\n\nThe Lewiatan sign still flickered above them: TWO BREADS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE."

Nerka's jammed with transports and militia...\n- You've said that three times! - Bargieła snapped - JESUS, WHO TAUGHT YOU TO DRIVE? TURN HERE, NEXT ONE RIGHT.\n- Oh, for God's sake... - Podraza groaned from the back seat. Besides an angry and bitter army chief, in the car there were also Krzysztof Szwej, pale and sweating, and Zbigniew Podraza, with folded arms and the face of a grumpy cat.\n- No! You listen to me! - Bargieła shouted, twisting around toward Szwej. - He wasn't supposed to be there! Bazylak! That worm, that coward! Sitting next to Czarzasty like his fucking intern! We were supposed to push, show strength! Instead, we shook hands and let them walk all over us!\n- You think this is helping? - Podraza snapped, unusually sharp. - You think screaming will undo the vote? It's politics, not a firing line.\n- Then maybe it should be a firing line! - Bargieła spat. - Because what we saw in that hall wasn't politics. That was betrayal in neat suits and polite applause.\n- I was trying to keep us from blowing the alliance to pieces! - Szwej snapped, but it came out thin. Unconvincing.\n- There it is. That bark. The rabid dog always wants war - Podraza laughed bitterly.\n- What i want, is a little fucking respect! We got none of that back there! You think your smug face and your spreadsheet talk bought us time? It bought us a leash! - continued Bargieła\n- Better a leash than a bullet! You want to burn half the counties over your wounded ego?\n- My ego?! - Bargieła lunged forward. - I've bled for this movement!\n- That's enough! - Szwej shouted, voice cracking like old wood. - Both of you!\nThe car bounced over a pothole. The driver yelped and swerved around a pile of rubble.\n- Shit, sorry! Roadblock ahead again!\n- They can move on Sławków and Strzemieszyce within days. - Podraza continued, breath heaving. - Sosnowiec pulls support, and we lose the railways. The Steelworks and logistics get cut off. The army splits.\nSzwej blinked, pale. - If we lose the army, we lose everything. But we didn't lose anything yet. War isn't coming.

dgr.11.t: "Whistling in the Dark"
dgr.11.desc: "An unbroken veil of darkness swallowed the Zagórze district. Two city-states, Dąbrowa Górnicza and Sosnowiec, stood on the edge of war - once bound by alliance, now locked in a silent standoff, each waiting for the other to blink. Tension hung thick; the Dąbrowa basin was a powder keg with a lit fuse. The old Intercounty was no more - only echoes remained, drowned beneath the rising storm. Route 94 divided the frontline. On the one side, Dąbrowa, on the other, Sosnowiec. Dąbrowa soldiers, being in a slightly worse position, sat in the trenches just before the road. On the other hand, Sosnowiec troopers could use the Alba building as a fortified position overlooking the plains ahead.\n\nKamil Zając was not a man easily shaken. He was a plain, straightforward Pole, raised on honest work and simple values. Dąbrowa Górnicza, the city of his parents and grandparents, all factory workers like himself, was more than his birthplace; it was his anchor. Kamil believed in fairness and equality, but he had never been drawn to communism. He was, above all, a patriot; a man willing to give his life for his home. Yet now, as a young sergeant, that conviction was clouded by something deeper: the thought of his wife and beautiful daughter. The idea of leaving them behind, of vanishing from their lives, was more terrifying than any battlefield.\n\nLieutenant Mateusz Maj stood opposite the barricade, quietly instructing his unit on what to do if the Dąbrowa eventually attacks. Yet he could not shake the feeling that the whole thing was wrong. Dąbrowa and Sosnowiec had just a few weeks ago marched under the same red banners. Now, divided by nothing but their leaders' unchecked ambitions, they found themselves on opposite sides of a fratricidal conflict. Once, he was an ambitious man, working closely within the party, and expecting a promotion at any time. However, a little bit of honesty placed him at the front line.\n\nThe two men had once been friends. Before the fighting, before the orders and the uniforms, they spent countless weekends together fishing at Pogoria Lake. It had been their ritual - early mornings with thermoses of hot tea, quiet conversations broken only by the soft splash of a line hitting the water. They never spoke much about politics; they did not need to. What bound them was something simpler: shared silence, the rhythm of casting and reeling, the comfort of a friend by your side. And now, they had no idea that they had become enemies, and sooner or later,  would meet again on the battlefield. Tensions on both sides reached a breaking point when a whistle echoed along the long-abandoned road. Soldiers immediately reached for their weapons, bracing for the worst. But within moments, they realised the battle had not begun, at least not yet. Perched on a rusted streetlamp, an owl hooted toward the full moon, its call sharp and haunting in the still night. A collective sigh of relief swept through the trenches. For now, the silence held. One wrong move from either side could snap this tension in half. Yet they could do nothing for now but wait."

dgr.13.desc: "- So Mareczek, to socialist Poland?\n- Cheers!\nThe whole scene was playing out on a bench in the middle of Jaworzno's main square. But the two men weren't just local aficionados of hard liquor. Mareczek - or, properly speaking, Marek Stolarczyk - and Krzysztof Grejda were officials sent by the People's Front to conduct socio-political reconnaissance. Their task: to figure out what the hell to do with the leftover commune councils still operating like ghosts of the previous regime.\n- So what now, Krzysiek - muttered Marek, shifting in his old coat and adjusting the badge with the People's Front emblem - do we call the commissars or the army HQ?\n- That's the thing. Commissars'll show up, start blabbing about \"ideological potential of the community\", \"opening dialogue with the commune councils\"... Maybe we can flip some of the young ones to our side.\n- Or maybe they spit in their faces and we come back with our dicks in our hands. And guess who'll get blamed? Us. I'm not carrying the weight for those amateurs - they ain't the brightest.\n\n- Then there's the army... - Grejda paused, like he was speaking of some primal force. - Clean. Simple. They roll in, secure the perimeter, bam - four trucks, two loudmouths on the ground, three cuffed, some shots in the air, and it's quiet for a month.\n- Problem with the army - Marek interjected - is once they roll in, no one knows who survives. This ain't gangland Mydlice, this is still Jaworzno. People here have some hope left. Bit of civilization, even.\nJózek took a swig. He glanced at the nearby bench, where someone had once scratched the sign KURWA 1994.\n- Maybe we split the difference. Report says the situation's... fluid. Recommend the soft option, but we're ready to go hard.\n- So no decision, but at least the bottle doesn't go to waste - Heniek summed up.\n\nSilence fell. A battered Jelcz bus rolled through the square, blasting The Internationale from a rooftop loudspeaker. Somewhere, a dog barked. On the horizon, smoke drifted - maybe a fire, maybe tires.\n- We'll call Białas - Stolarczyk said suddenly. - He's got someone at the precinct. He'll know if the councilors are just barking, or ready for a real punch.\n- And if they're not? We give the signal to the Greens from the unit.\n- We'll see who breaks first - said Józek with a grin.\nHeniek stood up, corked the bottle, and slipped it under his coat.\n- People's democracy in action, my friend.\n- Damn right - said Józek. - Grand, but finesse."

The boys can play, huh? - asked Bargieła, watching the intense match between Tęcza Błędów's reserve team and their first squad.\n- They might be playing, but I doubt they're playing football - replied his companion. And he wasn't just anyone - it was Jerzy Brzęczek himself. After the capitulation of the Truskolasy Free Club Association, he had been interned in Dąbrowa Górnicza. He wasn't free, but he wasn't quite a prisoner either. The Party's Central Committee was undecided about his fate, and so Brzęczek was temporarily sentenced to torture-watching matches of Dąbrowa's regional league teams. It was far from a pleasant sight.\n- They're not playing worse than the Polish national team - said Bargieła. The commander of the armed forces was here for one reason: to evaluate whether Brzęczek was worth recruiting. And why had they sent a nationalist rebel for the job? The Politburo had proudly declared they didn't want such a reactionary in the Central Committee, but he might still be useful as a staff element, helping to train soldiers. After all, how different is football training from military drills? Both sides shoot, defend, and attack.\n- Has the Politburo made any decisions? - Brzęczek asked.\n- They're incapable of deciding anything. They'll do what I recommend. What we need are people who can see potential in others and shape diamonds out of coal. And as you know, sir, we've got no shortage of coal.\n- \"Sir\"? I thought you people didn't have Sirs, only Comrades - the former coach now stared at Bargieła as if he were a mismatched wheel on a shopping cart. Or was it just a psychological game?\n- We don't need more red comrades bowing daily to portraits of Gierek or Stalin. I need people of action. Titles don't matter here - replied Bargieła, as passionate as ever. Brzęczek got the sense there was a double game being played here, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to be part of it. But the opportunity was real, and it would be a shame to waste the potential on offer.\n- How much freedom will I have when it comes to training methods? - Brzęczek feared a repeat of the PZPN days, where pressure from above and below forced him into changes he never truly believed in, hurting his vision of coaching. At least, that's what he always believed.\n- As far as I'm concerned, you can make them run around the Politburo with German flags. I'll take full responsibility. All I need from you is results. Not style. Not following some Soviet manual. Just results. That's all."

Within the first 24 months, 17 major facilities were nationalised, over 21,300 workers were transferred into state syndicates. Private ownership in core sectors dropped to below 2.1%.\n2. 312 km of paved roads laid — notably the ZP-7 arterial route linking Żarki, Łazy, and Sławków. 11 new logistics hubs were constructed (e.g., Katowice Steelworks Node), and 28 bridges were rebuilt or reinforced. 46% increase in public freight capacity reported across the region.\n3. 14,800 hectares consolidated across the gminas of Kroczyce, Klucze, and Siewierz. NGR Rudniki now delivers 12,000 tonnes of grain yearly. Tractor density increased to 1 per 21 ha. Over 3,200 farmers integrated into state employment structures.\n4. 12 schools opened (e.g., People's Technical School No. 3 in Olkusz), 5 correctional-labor centers built (largest in Jaworzno - Jeziorki), 8 polyclinics operational by mid-plan, 4 new factories employing over 870 workers.\n5. Only 19% of the targeted 18,000 prefab units were completed. Major sites in Czeladź and Sosnowiec left unfinished due to material shortages and \"construction miscoordination\".\n6. Pilot attempts in collectivisation of northern counties of our country met resistance. Mass withdrawals, tool thefts, and rural non-compliance halted the program at stage 1B.\n\nDespite difficulties, 78% of plan goals were achieved, and productivity levels were noticeably raised in overall 146%!

We offered shelter not as commodity, but as a right. And yet, as always, the enemies of the people lurked in the rubble of the old world, waiting. These economic vultures - landlords, speculators, and profit-chasers - could not bear to see roofs given freely to workers. They whispered sabotage into the very foundation of our plans. Where we laid bricks, they planted lies. Where we regulated, they hoarded. When the state fixed rent to fair levels, they cried \"collapse\" - and then ensured it by withdrawing labor, siphoning materials, and corrupting supply chains.\n\nIt was not the wisdom of our planning that failed, but the treachery of those who refuse to accept a world without exploitation. The recent turmoil in the housing market is no accident. It is a deliberate campaign to destabilize the People's Republic. But let this be known: we will not yield. The Party and the State will respond. Profiteers will face the full force of revolutionary justice. The black market of shelter will be broken. New housing projects, under tighter supervision and with deeper ideological training for all workers involved, will rise stronger and purer than before.

As the People's Republic boldly undertook the historic transformation of private land into collective prosperity, dark forces emerged from the countryside - forces still chained to the egoism of property and the poison of petty ownership. The collectivisation initiative, designed to lift the peasantry from the mud of feudal habit and into the light of socialist modernity, was met not with gratitude, but with resistance. Some villagers - stirred by reactionary whispers and poisoned traditions - refused to till for the common good. Tractors were sabotaged. Officials were obstructed. Grain was hoarded, tools hidden, and records falsified.\n\nThis is not struggle - this is sabotage. Let us be clear: the principle of collectivisation remains untouched, sacred, and eternal. It is the only true path toward an agrarian society free of exploitation. However, in the spirit of dialectical flexibility and temporary tactical retreat, the Central Committee has resolved to pause the implementation of full collectivisation in certain districts.\n\nThis is not a surrender, but a strategic recalibration.\n\nThe people must be re-educated. Trust must be rebuilt. The countryside must be made ready - not only in tools, but in spirit. In time, the hesitant will understand what their obstinance delayed: prosperity, equality, and mechanised abundance for all. Let the exploiters and their foreign-backed lies take no comfort. This retreat is temporary. The revolution never stops - it only changes its stride. Collectivisation delayed is not collectivisation denied. And the land, as always, belongs to the people."

However, it remains unclear what level of unification is actually on the table at this stage. Doubts persist regarding the true intentions of the remaining participants - are they genuinely willing to risk handing over power to Czarzasty, or will they fight to protect their own interests?

However, it's far from an effective occupation - more a series of sporadic black terror campaigns carried out by Antifa militias. This stems from the nature of the Jaworzno regime's system - or rather, the lack thereof. The regime embraces maximum decentralization and structural chaos, which has proven nearly impossible to export to the resistant populations of Mysłowice and Lędziny. The local backlash culminated in the formation of the Sabotagereferat Myslovitz, a group widely believed to be funded from Berlin. Now, tensions have reached a boiling point: the group has declared that armed resistance is the only way left to repel Antifa terror.
