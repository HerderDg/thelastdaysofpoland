 unification.14.t: "[GetNewspaper]Dąbrowa Górnicza unifies Zagłębie and Jura!"
 unification.14.desc: "In an unexpected turn of events, a little dictatorship from Dąbrowa Górnicza managed to conquer their surrounding territories. Surrounded by more powerful enemies, it held on, and thanks to the Katowice Steelworks and the power of industry it prevailed against the early onslaught, conquering Jura.\nThe strange combination of communism and nationalism has proved to be stable and effective so far. It is not entirely clear what the relations between individual factions are, but taking into account their morale - we cannot count on an imminent end to this pact of two devils.\nThe People's Front of Zagłębie (as was their official name) now has at its disposal the untamed industrial power of the Dąbrowa Basin. It would seem that they will hit Silesia next, but unofficial sources seem to report that their eyes are focused on Lesser Poland."
 unification.14.a: "Socialism or Death!"
