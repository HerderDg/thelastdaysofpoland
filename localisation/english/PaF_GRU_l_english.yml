unification.81.t: "[GetNewspaper]Grudziądz Command unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.81.desc: "Thrice defeated, humiliated, and nearly relieved of his duties for his failures during the Invasion, the general of the Northern Command refuses to yield. Despite a series of early setbacks, the battered remnant army in Grudziądz successfully beat back defeatist spirits, re-establishing itself as a capable fighting force and rolling across Kuyavian-Pomerania in a synchronized, combined arms operation reminiscent of Janusz Adamczak's finest days as a commanding officer. Due to the continued presence of hostile forces on Polish soil, the region has been temporarily reorganized under a military administration set to provide the means through which the resurgent army could launch further campaigns to restore order to the country. Citing internal stability, the state presently prohibits the expression of 'potentially dangerous' pro-democratic dissent, vowing to hold elections only once 'the safety of Poland has been guaranteed.' Yet are those declarations a real promise or merely the stalling words of a future junta?"
unification.81.a: "Seems we're on for another campaign season."

super.81.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.81.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.81.a: "United at last."

 ##IDEAS##

GRU_remnants: "Pitiful Remnants"
GRU_remnants_desc: "A third of the entire Polish Armed Forces, with some of the most modern equipment and thousands of hours spent on combat scenarios... crumbled in the span of a few hours. In the forests of Western Pomerania, the Northern Army Group was completely routed by the German troops, placing it on a never-ending retreat for the entire remaining duration of the campaign. The few divisions remaining under General Adamczak's command are composed mostly of support units and garrisons of both limited experience and morale. This is no longer an army. At best, it only pretends to be one."

GRU_swiecie: "A Losing Streak"
GRU_swiecie_desc: "Broken by the Germans, outflanked by their collaborators, caught completely off guard by the rebels... the defeats just keep on coming. The revolt in Świecie is yet another shameful mark on our already depressing record. By all metrics, we should easily be able to suppress this rebellion, but of course... poor logistics, internal struggles, ruined infrastructure... The days go by, our brothers on the other side of the river are fighting for their lives, and all that arrives on General Adamczak's desk are reports of unending failures and excuses. What remains of our reputation is on the line. If we fail to take this city, we'll assure all of Poland of our incompetence."

GRU_kliki: "Disloyal Cliques"
GRU_kliki_desc: "The first thing the military teaches is discipline. Respect for the higher ranks. Unquestioning obedience. All of that works great until you mess up enough times for everybody to start thinking they'd do a better job. While we were busy dealing with the Invasion's consequences, our senior officers built up their own power bases to such an extent that a forceful coup has become a real possibility. With every slip-up, the odds increase. With any action that tries to loosen their grip on our throats, they multiply. We've been forced to give our subordinates a free hand and cater to their every whim. Whatever it takes for them to not issue the order to replace us."
