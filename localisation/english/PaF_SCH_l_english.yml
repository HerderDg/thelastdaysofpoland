unification.210.t: "[GetNewspaper]Eternal Sonata unifes Northern Mazovia!" #po redakcji
unification.210.desc: "Northern Mazovia falls silent... so they can better hear the masterpieces of Fryderyk Chopin! The Realm of Euterpe, named after the Ancient Muse of Music, was founded by the distinguished pianist Krystian Zimerman. In his own words, the laureate of the IX International Chopin Piano Competition couldn't sit idly while his homeland burned and violent warlords tore it apart. He traveled from his home in Basel to Żelazowa Wola - Chopin’s historic and scenic birthplace to protect the legacy of the great composer and establish a rallying point for his supporters. In the previous years, he gathered many sympathizers with vague promises of a unified Poland free from imperialist, militaristic invasions, his message resonating during numerous stunning themed concerts. It turned out that such a performance was enough to gather a sufficient number of prominent supporters required to conquer Northern Mazovia, despite Zimmerman's overt distaste for military matters."
unification.210.a: "The first note of the crescendo."
