unification.210.t: "[GetNewspaper]Eternal Sonata unifes North Mazovia!" #do redakcji
unification.210.desc: "North Mazovia falls silent... so they can better hear the masterpieces of Fryderyk Chopin! The Realm of Euterpe, named after the Muse of Music was founded by the famous and awarded pianist Krystian Zimerman. The laureate of the IX International Chopin Piano Competition in his own words couldn't sit idly while his homeland burned and a violent warlord tore it apart. He traveled from his home in Basel to Żelazowa Wola in Sochaczew province - the birthplace of Chopin to protect the legacy of the great composer and establish a rallying point for his supporters. In the previous years, he gathered many patriots with vague promises of a unified Poland free from imperialist, militaristic invasions, strengthening his message by playing numerous stunning concerts. It turned out it was enough to gather enough competent people to conquer North Mazovia, despite the Zimerman's distaste for military matters."
