unification.42.t: "[GetNewspaper]Republic of Nowy Sącz unifies Podhale!"
unification.42.desc: "As states which bend to the wishes of the common man fall, in their place rises one built for the elite few. Following the overthrow of Nowy Sącz's democratic government by a triumvirate of business magnates, many cynics doubted the viability of the new corporate regime. And yet, no amount of external slander could bring the republic’s downfall, and apparently, neither could Podhale’s warlords. As the hired goons made quick work of untrained militias, it became painfully clear that deep pockets hold more power than the people’s voice. Now, the mountains once more give home to freedom, yet it is not the commoners that are liberated, but rather the markets. For the moment, the corporate overlords seem content to keep their accounts off the region’s labor, yet their appetite can only grow. After all, the riches of Kraków lie ripe for the taking."
unification.42.a: "Atlas unchained"

super.42.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.42.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.42.a: "United at last."
