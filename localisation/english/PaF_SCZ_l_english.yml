unification.42.t: "[GetNewspaper]Republic of Nowy Sącz unifies Podhale!"
unification.42.desc: "As states that bend to the wishes of the common man fall, in their place rises one built for the elite few. Following the overthrow of Nowy Sącz's democratic government by a triumvirate of business magnates, many cynics doubted the viability of the new corporate regime. And yet, no amount of external slander could bring about the downfall of the enlightened oligarchic republic, and apparently, neither could Podhale's warlords. As the hired goons made quick work of untrained militias, it became painfully clear that deep pockets hold far more power than the muffled sounds of the people's voice ever could. Now, the mountains once more give home to freedom, yet it is not the commoners that have been liberated, but rather the markets. For the moment, the corporate overlords seem content to continue pocketing the fruits of the region's labor, yet their appetite can only grow. After all, the riches of Kraków lie ripe for the taking."
unification.42.a: "Atlas unchained"

super.42.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
