unification.129.t: "[GetNewspaper]Knights of Christ unify Subcarpathia!"
unification.129.desc: "A great blow was dealt to the forces of satanism and occultism within Poland today as Jesus has once again triumphed, this time over the God-fearing region of Subcarpathia. The man who delivered him this victory is none other than Father Piotr Natanek, a controversial priest on a mission to cleanse the fallen nation from the devil's corrupting schemes. Hell-bent on eliminating what he refers to as "demonic influences," the self-proclaimed Warrior of Christ has ordered grand burnings of pre-Fall books that stand against the Lord's teachings. All references to evolution and magic are banned in the state, with anyone found to be in possession of illegal materials, including Harry Potter novels, Pokemon cards, metal music, and even sufficiently dark clothing, facing a mandatory "religious re-education." Heads now turn with shock and fear towards Subcarpathia, as Poland's most religiously fundamentalist state seems to have gone insane in its faith."
unification.129.a: "If your child opposes the Warriors of Christ, know that something is happening."

super.129.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
