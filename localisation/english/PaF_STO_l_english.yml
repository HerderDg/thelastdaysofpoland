unification.126.t: "[GetNewspaper]Front Zero unifies Holy Cross!"
unification.126.desc: "Law and Justice, the one party within Poland that managed to hold onto power for any respectable length of time, lies dead in the water. At least in the Holy Cross voivodeship, where Front Zero rolled over all their opposition, securing the territory tightly within its grasp. Wherever the Front's militia marched, a wave of arrests followed until all members of PiS in the region have been arrested and tried before a Tribunal made up of Stonoga's closest cohorts. Reportedly, sentences varied based on the accused' ranks within the party, with rumors of the higher-ups receiving truly draconian punishments. In a heated public address from the balcony of Kielce's Town Hall, Zbigniew Stonoga swore to put an end to the tyranny of PiS across all of Poland and to finally bring real law and justice to the nation. Critics question the veracity of such claims, pointing to the brutal treatment of political dissidents and Stonoga's dictatorial rule up to this point, though time will tell if their worries ever come to pass."
