tou.1.desc: "The Fall of Poland was a truly unthinkable catastrophe. Waves of protests, riots, street fights and over time - regular, bloody skirmishes and destructive battles embraced what was once known as Polish land. \n\n Time passed, when European forces, led by Germany, finally occupied the savage western part of the former country. In the south, they founded the Eurokommissariat Schlesien as the sentimental land of their ancestors, where they could rest and admire these beautiful landscapes.  Luxury resorts that would meet western standards were needed, so EKS patrols searched the pre-fall tourist centers.\n\n They returned with stories of a city untouched by the bombs and artillery shells, that had massacred big rest of the Lower Silesia and a great wall spanning the Bóbr River. The EKS mobilized its army to occupyJelenia Góra and the Bóbr Dam, restoring it to working condition. Days went by, but across the unstable region, many other societies had arisen under different flags. A numerous armies of Polish patriots, Gypsies, anglers, copper miners, alcoholics, femislavs and others newly created during the collapse of Eurokommissariat. The city is under great threat once again...\n\n Through it all, Jelenia Góra has stayed open for tourists under the control of its mysterious, but beloved overseer, Tadeusz Gołębiewski - Known all over Poland from a chain of top-class holiday resorts. Mr. Gołębiewski made an arrangement with local government and businessmen to manage a lucrative city full of entertainment. Privatized police forces and hired german mercenaries keep order in the streets and and in the surrounding Karkonosze region.\n\n "
