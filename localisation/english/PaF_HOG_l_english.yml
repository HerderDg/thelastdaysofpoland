unification.151.t: "[GetNewspaper]Ad Arma Paramilitaries unify Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.151.desc: "Kuyavia has taken up arms. With the unexpected victory of a relatively minor paramilitary organization over all other warlords within the voivodeship's borders, both civilian and military governments alike, the region has found itself facing an uncertain future. While Jacek Hoga's statelet is undoubtedly reactionary in nature, harkening back to nationalistic sentiments and traditional values like any typical right-wing ideologue's creation, the core principle, the effects of which nearly all citizens have already begun to feel, as well as the most likely reason why Ad Arma's forces were able to punch far above their logistical and industrial weight, is the leader's near-fanatical insistence on arming every single one of his citizens, turning his realm into effectively a paramilitary with a state. Now, as a fresh batch of recruits trains to perform their duties once the Fatherland calls, the enemies of Hoga tremble, knowing that the endless wave of combatants may soon crash into their territory."
unification.151.a: "With 40 million soldiers, maybe they'll finally have a chance against the Germans..."

super.151.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.151.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.151.a: "United at last."

HOG_prusy: "The Paramilitary With a State"
HOG_prusy_desc: "'Ad Arma' is a Defense Foundation first, a functioning government second. Jacek Hoga firmly maintains his primary focus on the militarization of Polish society, leaving the territories under his control to effectively govern themselves. The state apparatus does not extend far beyond the units' command structure, and most people's only interaction with its representatives is when a camo-wearing commando arrives in their village, pressuring everyone to 'voluntarily' enlist in one of the available formations. After all, a civilian is just a soldier who hasn't yet been trained and issued a firearm."

HOG_zadupie: "The Outer Reaches"
HOG_zadupie_desc: "A few backwater towns, a handful of villages, miles upon miles of countryside... basically, a whole lot of nothing. By choosing to pacify the voivodeship's eastern borderlands and remaining uninvolved in Toruń, we basically drew the short straw when it comes to placement. Initially, we were only supposed to stay here for a short while until we linked up with Mentzen's forces in the city. Now, it looks like we have no choice but to hunker down. For all its existence, this territory was designed for little more than subsistence. Any industrial base beyond simple workshops will have to either be built from scratch or stolen from elsewhere once we move out."

HOG_stany: "Gun-Toting Liberty"
HOG_stany_desc: "The state is often defined as having a monopoly on violence. For any wannabe tyrant, it is preferable to keep the population weak, docile, and unable to defend itself. Yet it is this weakness that has corroded societies from the inside, making them reliant on a constantly overreaching government to resolve their daily troubles. Not anymore. If the Polish nation is to rise from the ashes, its people must learn that only they can ensure their own freedom. If someone tries to take it away, they have all the tools they need to protect it without the administration getting involved. What methods they use to defend their own property is none of our concern."
