unification.151.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Principality of Kuyavia unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.151.desc: "The fall of Rydzyk opened Pandora’s Box in Toruń as factions turned on each other, seeing their one chance at power. Surprisingly, the dark horse of the city’s politics has emerged victorious, with Jacek Hoga of the reactionaries now in charge. An enigma even among local residents, reports seem to suggest that the new leader aims to turn the nation into a form of monarchy. After purging the city of all remaining influence of Rydzyk, the state turned outwards, using their militias and paramilitaries to crush all other forces within the voivodeship. Relative stability returns to the region as the fledgling nation searches for its identity. Refugees flooding from the region speak of an aggressive campaign to promote traditional values to bring the rest of the region up to speed with the faction’s politics as numerous rights previously enjoyed by the people of Kuyavia are quickly being curtailed."
