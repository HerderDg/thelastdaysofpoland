unification.134.t: "[GetNewspaper]Republic of Tarnobrzeg unifies Subcarpathia!"
unification.134.desc: "While other voivodeships find themselves in the throes of madness and political radicalism, normalcy has returned to the serene Subcarpathia. Rather than succumb to the rhetoric of demagogues and despots, the people of the region have made their voices heard. With it being the sole democratic faction left within the war-torn territory, people rallied behind Elżbieta Witek’s government in full force, the combination of army remnants and volunteers able to repel both external forces of the Ukrainian invasion and other warlord statelets. Stability returns to the voivodeship, but the task of reconstruction is far from complete. While they may cheer their hard-fought victory today, the masses still suffer from poverty and famine. The war has brought irreparable damage upon Poland, and the grim reality is that even unified, Subcarpathia cannot be left alone, spared from the coming bloodshed. May the people of the region enjoy this momentary peace, for it is far more fickle than they ever dare imagine."
unification.134.a: "Sane minds have prevailed. If only the same could be said about the rest of the country..."

super.134.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
