 NAC_legacy_of_the_nsz: "Legacy of the NSZ"
 NAC_legacy_of_the_nsz_desc: "Just like 80 years ago, so today has our Fatherland fallen under German occupation, only this time disguised by a thin veneer of legitimacy so graciously provided by the leftist politicians and activists - traitors who sold their country for promises of achieving their degenerate liberal utopia. Back in those trying times, the brave partisans of the National Armed Forces stood firm against the German menace, giving up their lives so that Poland may see another day. Guided by their example, we will stop at nothing until we've defeated our Eternal Enemy, and our homeland is once again free. "
 NAC_on_euroliberal_land: "On Euroliberal Land"
 NAC_on_euroliberal_land_desc: "Our partisan struggle has forced us to operate on deeply unfriendly territory, as the citizens of Greater Poland, blinded by decades of leftist propaganda, desperately cling to the dying liberal ideology and the rotten European Union. Rather than welcome us as heroes and liberators, they look down on our patriotism, scheming to undo all our hard-fought victories. Once we stabilize the frontlines and the threat of imminent invasion is no longer upon us, we must turn inwards and quash their puny dissent, or else it may grow into a full uprising against our rule."
 NAC_uncertain_triumvirate: "Uncertain Triumvirate"
 NAC_uncertain_triumvirate_desc: "Though we all share a common goal, our movement is far from being uniform. In fact, its three main factions are bound only by the shared hatred and struggle against the occupying forces, yet their visions for the nation's future differ greatly, leading to rising tensions within our ranks. As our fighters look at one another with distrust and the divides between the leaders deepen, all it takes is a single wrong step for our army to splinter into brotherly conflict. \n\nWith the enemy constantly breathing down our necks, we cannot afford to show any weakness, for it may just prove to be our undoing."

unification.52.t: "[GetNewspaper]Nationalists unify Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.52.desc: "Recent news from Greater Poland indicates that the northern half of the voivodeship, still reeling from the collapse of the Eurokommissariats, has been overtaken by forces loyal to the All-Polish Initiative, an organization with deep ties to the pre-Fall National Movement. Seizing upon the momentum of their armed uprising against Tusk and his German masters, the group managed to seize the regional centers of Poznań and Piła, solidifying their iron grip on the territory. Described by critics as prone to fascistic leanings, the new government instituted a massive militarization of daily life with fiercely jingoistic rhetoric towards the state's enemies, while internal politics have largely been defined by strict enforcement of deeply traditionist values. It seems that in a single flash, all of the defeated Eurokommissar's efforts to bring European values to the region have been undone as Greater Poland spirals further into the abyss of nationalism."

 POLITICS_KRZYSZTOF_BOSAK_DESC: "16 June 2025 \n\nThat was undoubtedly the worst day of Krzysztof's life. In just one day, his dreams, goals, and desires were obliterated. After PiS's victory in 2023, he knew that eventually, everything would fall apart, but not like this - first the Bałuty incident, then that bloody German invasion. His country was gone, and he failed miserably. He never stopped thinking about how it could be if he did something to prevent this tragedy from happening. \n\nAlthough he did not surrender, once the German invasion commenced, he and his colleagues from the All-Polish Initiative decided to take arms against the foreign invader. They were fighting fearlessly, with all odd's stacked against them. It was not long until Germany, with help from the traitors, established Eurocommisariats. The brave patriots were abandoned and stranded in the woods in the middle of Wielkopolskie voivodeship. \n\nLife in the camp was not easy at all. Shortages, despair, and the misery of their lives considerably affected their morale. The vision of an independent Polish State was no more. They tried to make the Germans' lives as nightmarish as they could, but the partisan raids mainly were unsuccessful. A lot of good folks have died for the cause of seeing Poland united again someday. \n\nThe years have passed, and even Krzysztof knows their time is limited. Many deserted because they could not stand this life with constant fear. How long until Tusk's forces decide to end their little rebellion once and for all? Is it even worth fighting for the lost cause? He constantly questions this himself before every speech. They trust him, they believe him. Even if he has doubts, he must be fearless in the image of his people. \n\nThe one thing is clear. §R\n\nThey will not surrender until every one of them is dead."§
