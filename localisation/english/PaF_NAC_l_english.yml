 NAC_legacy_of_the_nsz_desc: "Just like 80 years ago, so today has our Fatherland fallen under German occupation, only this time disguised by a thin veneer of legitimacy so graciously provided by the leftist politicians and activists – traitors who sold their country for promises of achieving their degenerate liberal utopia. Back in those trying times, the brave partisans of the National Armed Forces stood firm against the German menace, giving up their lives so that Poland may see another day. Guided by their example, we will stop at nothing until we’ve defeated our Eternal Enemy, and our homeland is once again free. "
 NAC_on_euroliberal_land: "On Euroliberal Land"
 NAC_on_euroliberal_land_desc: "Our partisan struggle has forced us to operate on deeply unfriendly territory, as the citizens of Greater Poland, blinded by decades of leftist propaganda, desperately cling to the dying liberal ideology and the rotten European Union. Rather than welcome us as heroes and liberators, they look down on our patriotism, scheming to undo all our hard-fought victories. Once we stabilize the frontlines and the threat of imminent invasion is no longer upon us, we must turn inwards and quash their puny dissent, or else it may grow into a full uprising against our rule."
 NAC_uncertain_triumvirate: "Uncertain Triumvirate"
 NAC_uncertain_triumvirate_desc: "Though we all share a common goal, our movement is far from being uniform. In fact, its three main factions are bound only by the shared hatred and struggle against the occupying forces, yet their visions for the nation’s future differ greatly, leading to rising tensions within our ranks. As our fighters look at one another with distrust and the divides between the leaders deepen, all it takes is a single wrong step for our army to splinter into brotherly conflict. \n\nWith the enemy constantly breathing down our necks, we cannot afford to show any weakness, for it may just prove to be our undoing."

unification.52.t: "[GetNewspaper]All-Polish Republic unifies Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.52.desc: "Recent news from Greater Poland indicate that the northern half of the voivodeship, still reeling from the collapse of the Eurokommissariats, has been overtaken by forces loyal to the All-Polish Initiative, an organization with deep ties to the pre-Fall National Movement. Seizing upon the momentum of their armed uprising against Tusk and his German masters, the group managed to seize the regional centers of Poznań and Piła, solidifying their iron grip on the territory. Described by critics as prone to fascistic leanings, the new government instituted a massive militarization of daily life with fiercely jingoistic rhetoric towards the state’s enemies, while internal politics have largely been defined by strict enforcement of deeply traditionist values It seems that in a single flash, all of the defeated Eurokommissar’s efforts to bring European values to the region have been undone, as Greater Poland spirals further into the abyss of nationalism." #, with any display of progressive, non-Christian and LGBT sympathies harshly penalized. wsadzam za hasha na wypadek gdyby przydało się gdzie indziej
