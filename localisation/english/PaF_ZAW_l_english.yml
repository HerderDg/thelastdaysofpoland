unification.203.t: "[GetNewspaper]Zawiercie unifies Zagłębie and Jura!"
unification.203.desc: "Once part of the beating heart of Polish industry, the disparate territories to the north of the Silesian Basin have collapsed into countless warring statelets. Recently, however, a stabilising force has emerged upon the Kraków-Częstochowa Highlands. The Janoska-led government of Zawiercie managed to successfully wrangle itself out of its precarious internal struggles and attained a dominant position within the region. The land between the Polish state’s historical and religious capitals holds a central position overlooking some of its most culturally significant territories, turning the state founded in Zawiercie into a significant candidate to unite the entirety of Lesser Poland. It remains to be seen whether the economy fueled by rich mineral deposits and various heavy industry plants left over from before the Fall will allow the Bulwark of Jura to maintain its regional supremacy."
unification.203.a: "The Jurassic Bulwark stands tall."
