unification.17.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Zawiercie unifies Zagłębie and Jura!"
unification.17.desc:0 "For many years, the areas of northern Upper Silesia have been the scene of the struggle of local warlords and cliques with a decidedly different style of governments. The hostility between the local factions eventually escalated to the level of full-scale wars for the unification of the region, from which only one could emerge victorious.\nUnexpectedly, the Zawiercie Republic under the leadership of Jarosław Gowin became the unifier of Jura. It would seem that this politician, associated with the moderate wing of the United Right in 2015-2021, has already had the best years of his political career behind him. However, the Fall opened up new opportunities for Gowin. After maintaining power in the initially politically unstable republic, the reforms ordered by him in the armed forces and efforts to rebuild the economy resulted in Zawiercie gaining a key advantage over his opponents and allowed them to be pacified.\nJarosław Gowin is now at the head of the entire north of Upper Silesia. Will he try to pursue further agreement or will he be forced to use force?"
