unification.153.t: "[GetNewspaper]Naturschutzverein Wartheland unifies Northern Greater Poland"
unification.153.desc: "The Northern Lands of Greater Poland have been reunified under German rulership once more, yet not by the might of Berlin, but instead by the pioneers of the Second Ostsiedlung that settled in the valleys of the Warta River following the Invasion. Abandoned in the wake of the Eurokommissariats’ collapse, left to the wolves and expected to quickly perish to the retributive vengeance of the Polish warlords, through fierce guerilla warfare and desperate conscription, the frontiersmen nevertheless managed to defend their adopted homeland against several better-trained and equipped forces. \n\nThe Naturschutzverein now finds itself in control of vast swathes of territory, inhabited by a bitter and hostile Polish population. And though the willpower and determination of the German settlers are second to none, the continued survival of the relatively minuscule minority’s state is far from guaranteed."
unification.153.a: "Verdammt!"

super.153.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
