unification.65.t: "[GetNewspaper]Lechite Tribes unify Opolskie!"
unification.65.desc: "Today, all of Poland has collectively cringed at the news orginating from the usually silent and not thought of Opole Voivodeship. Apparently, the whole region has been united by Janusz Bieszk's turbo-lechites, and now all of Opole has been reformed into the 'first region of the reconstructed Aryan superstate of ancient Lechites' - the Lechina Empire... \n\nApart from photos of historic sites such as the Moszna Castle, Nysa forts and the Opole Główne railway station getting vandalized and demolished to 'tear down Vatican's lie about Poles' Lechitic past', Polish Internet is also getting flooded by memes and videos of Bieszk's coronation that took place in the Slavic gród in Byczyna. Lech XI 'the Restorer' - as he's now refered to - came to power thanks to his research, books and theories that helped shape the myths of an ancient Lechitic superpower, with his new regal name also meant to simultaneously represent Lechia's continuity and the restoration of her ancient glory."
unification.65.a: "May the Slavic gods of wisdom finally bestow some braincells upon them."

super.65.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.65.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.65.a: "United at last."
