unification.101.t: "[GetNewspaper]Godish Białystok unifies Podlachia!"
unification.101.desc: "'Order' comes to Podlasie as famous 'politician', 'orator' and 'influencer' Krzysztof Kononowicz consolidates the wild lands under his massive abdomen. If rumors are to be believed, Konon's Godish Knurocracy is a government impossible to define within such understandable terms as 'ideology' or 'political thought' and the rule of law and bureaucracy are mostly defined by Konon's momentary beliefs that change on a whim. These reports though are proving to be quite unreliable, the uncivilized climate of the region already makes the spread of information difficult.\n Despite these difficulties the intentions of Konon appear to be quite clear as he did address many questions expected to be answered by him in his 'Godish Court', a place visited by many esteemed travelers.\n During these court visits, he assured that his intention is for there to be no banditry thievery, in fact, for there to be nothing. He also reassured the security of his rule by claiming, that at least 300%, if not 400% of the population supports him."
