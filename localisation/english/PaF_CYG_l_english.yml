unification.60.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Gypsy State unites Lower Silesia"
unification.60.desc:0 "We are getting rumors of an unusual event. Gypsies, who had won their self-determination after the fall of Poland, united the lands of Lower Silesia. The Gypsy people fought fiercely for their future more than once, and the same happened this time. Now that they have secured the former voivodeship, their tabors can safely traverse these lands.\n\nManaged by the king, with the very strong influence of the council of elders, the state begins to stabilize and take steps towards to secure nation's future in such uncertain times. As minority rule with a strong class division is difficult to maintain, especially among hot-blooded Poles, the state faces a real problem. With the help of brave warriors who suppress any sign of disobedience, as well as the methods of amusing citizens through great carnivals full of wine and dancing, it maybe can succeed and exist for a longer time."
unification.60.a:0 "Very unexpected."
