unification.60.t: "[GetNewspaper]Gypsy State unifies Lower Silesia"
unification.60.desc: "We are getting rumors of an unusual event. The Romani, who had won their self-determination after the fall of Poland, united the lands of Lower Silesia. The Romani people fought fiercely for their future more than once, and the same had happened this time. Now that they have secured the former voivodeship, their tabors can safely traverse these lands. Managed by the king, under the very strong influence of the council of elders, the state begins to stabilize the region and take steps towards securing the nation's future in such uncertain times. As minority rule with a strong class division is difficult to maintain, especially among hot-blooded Poles, the state faces a real problem. With the help of brave warriors who suppress any sign of disobedience, as well as the methods of amusing citizens through great carnivals full of wine and dancing, it maybe can succeed and exist for a longer time."
unification.60.a: "How did that even happen?"

super.60.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.60.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.60.a: "United at last."
