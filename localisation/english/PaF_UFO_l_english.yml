unification.174.t: "[GetNewspaper]Area 52 Ufologists unify Kuyavia!"
unification.174.desc: "The citizens of Kuyavia watch on in shock as against all odds, their region has been seized by a secretive organization dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life. Small in number and seen as little more than a disjointed grouping of conspiracy theorists desperately clinging to a long-forgotten alleged sighting, the unexplainable success of Zagórski's ufologists has led some to claim that 'Nautilus' may truly be in possession of thus-unknown alien technology. Leaked documents depicting incomprehensible schematics of interplanetary vehicles and futuristic weaponry indicate a concentrated reverse-engineering effort, while hundreds of antennas aimed at the universe's infinite vastness work ceaselessly to establish first contact. Despite all these signs, skeptics dismiss the statelet as a product of mass hysteria, and its search as nothing but a futile spur of collective madness, but given the recent flair-up of reported alien activity in Kuyavia, there might be more to this story than science can possibly explain."
