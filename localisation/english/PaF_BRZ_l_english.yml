BRZ_legacy_of_pzpn: "Legacy of PZPN"
BRZ_legacy_of_pzpn_desc: "There has been no organization as damaging to football within our nation, and Jerzy Brzęczek’s career for that matter, as the Polish Football Association (PZPN). This corrupt clique of the sport’s dinosaurs has influenced every facet of the beautiful game, leaving a whole generation of players and coaches to rot under the ideas of the “Polish Training Thought”. Nearly our entire pool of talent has been brought up under this system, stifling any form of creativity and technical skill. Unless we dip into uncharted waters and fully reform our approach to football, we are bound to forever remain in mediocrity."
BRZ_nothings_wrong_poles: "Nothing's Wrong, Poles"
BRZ_nothings_wrong_poles_desc: "Years of defeat and disappointment have created a unique mentality within the average Polish football fan. While a typical Janusz loves to complain, he will stick by the team no matter what, turning out in full force for every match, usually sat on a couch in front of his aging TV with a beer in his hand. Ever the conformist, we can expect little to no meaningful resistance to our plans from the majority of the population, even if the times truly get desperate."
BRZ_bandit_hooligans: "Ultras on the Streets"
BRZ_ultras: "Ultras on the Streets"
BRZ_bandit_hooligans_desc: "You can never truly feel safe wandering the streets of ZWKT-controlled cities, as raving bands of Ultras representing each of the teams active in our territory regularly harass the populace, approaching selected citizens, demanding they state their club affiliation, and beating or robbing them upon hearing a wrong answer. And when they’re not busy terrifying the people, they fight amongst themselves, leaving us to deal with any collateral damage. With each day that we fail to find a permanent solution to their violence, our towns burn with the fire of a thousand flares."

 ##First Tree##
BRZ_first_whistle: "First Whistle"
BRZ_first_whistle_desc: "When the collapse of Poland opened Pandora’s Box, every ideology under the sun spewed from it. With the urban folk splintering themselves, one declaring their loyalty to the anarchists, the next one to the militarists, yet another to the church, the peripheral towns of Truskolasy, Kłobuck, and Krzepice laid huddled together, awaiting their eventual conqueror with bated breath. In a twist of fate, they would instead find themselves on the national stage through the work of Jerzy Brzęczek. What began as a passion project aiming to rekindle the failed coach’s career in his boyhood team ended up spiraling into the foundation for a new statelet. On every step of his journey, he saw the sheer desperation and plight of his brethren. Unable to leave them to suffer, he took the reins of power, styling himself as the Supreme Coach and quickly consolidating the neighboring territory in an effort to provide for those struggling to get by. And so, the ZWKT stands alone in the middle of the storm that engulfed Poland, two goals leading them towards the light – one of personal glory and one of the common good. It remains to be seen whether the washed-up Brzęczek can ensure either of them."
BRZ_representing_olimpia: "Representing Olimpia Truskolasy"
BRZ_representing_olimpia_desc: "Besides a simple pitch, long overgrown since the German invasion halted all lower leagues within the country, not much remains of the Supreme Coach’s boyhood club; the team in which he took his first steps as a player relegated merely to an old memory. An outsider’s eye would most likely not even be able to recognize that anything of note used to stand here. One day, football will return to Poland, reaching greater heights than ever before, and this humble town will witness it all firsthand, with the name Olimpia Truskolasy spoken in the same breath as European powerhouses. But, until then, we need to restore it to an operational state, so that soon football can be played here once more, just like in those good old times."
BRZ_national_football_team: "National Football Team"
BRZ_national_football_team_desc: "Over its hundred years of history, our national team has failed time and time again to reach its full potential, save for a single blip of form nearly half a century ago. From top to bottom, every element of the game has been stifled by corruption and outdated training methods. As such, we have never truly been able to compete against the continent’s elite, content with beating second-rate sides and celebrating not tournament triumphs, but even at times mere qualifications. In a way, the Fall was a blessing, ridding the nation of harmful entities, such as the PZPN, and allowing football to truly be born anew, finally without the restrictions of the establishment. With the brilliant mind of our Supreme Coach at last free to shape the sport according to his will, we’ll ensure that Poland takes its rightful place among the world’s greatest."
BRZ_first_appointments: "First Appointments"
BRZ_first_appointments_desc: "Now that the facilities are finally in working order, we’re ready to get the team up and running. With most of our former contacts having fled the country at the first rumors of instability and many of those who stayed effectively missing, we’ll have to resort to less sophisticated methods of recruitment. It’s time to blast the territory of ZWKT with flyers, billboards, and ads. If you have any footballing experience and are at least remotely in shape, try out for the team and we’ll do everything in our power to accommodate you. Sure, the quality of the vast majority of these players is bound to be questionable, but over time, hopefully, we should be able to attract some actual talent."
BRZ_creation_of_nsfl: "Creation of North Silesian Football League"
BRZ_creation_of_nsfl_desc: "In order to develop, our players need regular match experience. While normally the job of enrolling Olimpia into the local league system would be a simple one, requiring a single phone call to the appropriate office, no such system exists since the nation's splintering. As such, it falls on us to create one from scratch, and luckily, we aren’t the only ones looking for someone to play against. At present, a dozen clubs operate across our territory, most of which should be more than willing to compete in the first edition of the planned North Silesian Football League. If they perform well enough, their brightest talents might even earn themselves a chance to represent the ZWKT against other statelets once we re-establish the National Team."
BRZ_klobuck_training_centre: "Kłobuck Training Centre"
BRZ_klobuck_training_centre_desc: "Every training session we hold at the current facilities of Olimpia Truskolasy painfully exposes the shortcomings of the crumbling stadium. Each goal-bound shot stopped by the muddy pitch, or twisted ankle from tripping on uneven grass makes a mockery of our claims of professionalism. The only way to move forward is the creation of an entirely new training center – one even the most pretentious members of the old national team couldn’t scoff at. We will turn Kłobuck from a sleepy town on the periphery of Jura into the most respected and renowned sporting facility in the country, equipped with everything our players could possibly need. No longer will we have to desperately seek out anyone with even a crumb of talent. We’ll make sure any self-respecting footballer knows the only way to meaningfully develop his skills is to flock to our ranks."
BRZ_nsfl_inauguration_cup: "NSFL Inauguration Cup"
BRZ_nsfl_inauguration_cup_desc: "As preparations for the league’s launch continue, what better way to generate buzz for the upcoming competition, as well as give our players some much-needed match sharpness than a tournament consisting of some of the region’s best teams? The cup will be a celebration of football’s rebirth within the region, so let’s make sure that when locals put their dusty scarves and jerseys back on after years of disuse, we give them a showing that’ll make them begging for more. And whilst the result may be only secondary to the greater significance of the occasion, obviously, the boost from winning some silverware wouldn’t hurt either."
BRZ_first_training_camp: "First Training Camp"
BRZ_first_training_camp_desc: "Compared to the conditions our players have gotten used to training in, our newly built facilities are truly state-of-the-art. For all their grandeur, however, they are worthless if there is nobody using them. Luckily, preparations have already been made to bring the best players from all across the ZWKT to Kłobuck for the first combined training camp. With many of the participants unfamiliar with the Supreme Coach’s training methods, it will take a while to get everyone up to speed with their new roles, positions, and tasks on the field. While some may grumble at being forced to rethink their playstyle, having spent their entire careers under one system, it is a necessary step if we are to ever compete on the national stage."
BRZ_match_liswarta_krzepice: "Match with Liswarta Krzepice"
BRZ_match_liswarta_krzepice_desc: "Our upcoming opposition – Liswarta, represents everything wrong with pre-Fall Poland, a relic of the times gone by. Staunchly conservative, their following has long served as a center of resistance to our governance, aiming to undo the majority of Brzęczek’s policies and return the ZWKT to the 'tried and tested methods' that brought it to ruin in the first place. Despite their foolishness, this decisive stance resulted in a wave of support coalescing around the team, which could pose a threat if left unchecked. What better way to show the inferiority of their beloved methods than to crush them on the pitch? A good result should be able to bring a sizable number of their fans back into our camp."
BRZ_match_znicz_klobuck: "Match with Znicz Kłobuck"
BRZ_match_znicz_klobuck_desc: "Next up – we face perhaps the most troublesome team in the league. Znicz Kłobuck has always been a gathering ground for the nationalist crowd, their ultras having a reputation of vicious vigilantes, patrolling their city and violently eliminating any signs of 'anti-Polish activity' ... which seems to include supporting other clubs or really anything the hooligans appear to dislike at that moment. At times, even the opposition players couldn’t consider themselves safe, and it seems unlikely that Brzęczek’s authority would prove enough to guarantee there is no blood spilled during or after the match. Therefore, the plan is simple – beat them hard enough to demoralize them and get the hell out there as quickly as possible."
BRZ_truskolasy_leading_role: "Truskolasy Leading Role"
BRZ_truskolasy_leading_role_desc: "There is only one club worthy of winning the NSFL and there is only one coach worthy of lifting its’ trophy. It is crucial to the entire foundation of our state that the first edition of the league is won by Olimpia Truskolasy. After all, how can we build the mythos of a tactical mastermind able to erase the generational shame brought by Polish football, who could finally make us able to compete with Spain, Germany, and even the damned Portuguese if we can’t even beat a bunch of farmers from some village in the middle of nowhere? No matter the results against our rivals, we must ensure that this title goes to us one way or another. If we failed on the pitch, we might need to pull some additional levers to prevent any embarrassments."
BRZ_strike_force_of_truskolasy: "Strike Force of Truskolasy"
BRZ_strike_force_of_truskolasy_desc: "The Polish anarchy is a lawless land, and while we strive for peaceful co-existence, the same cannot be said about the various warlord statelets surrounding us. Despite our initial reluctance to admit it, our government simply has no chance to survive without a functioning defense force when our neighbors move to reunify the nation once the stalemate breaks and fighting resumes. One way or another, we’ll have to draw into our resource and manpower pools and create an army that could stand toe-to-toe with anyone who dares try to conquer Truskolasy, lest we become merely another footnote in the story of someone else's glorious conquest."
BRZ_issue_preparations_in_clubs: "Issue Preparations in Clubs"
BRZ_issue_preparations_in_clubs_desc: "There will be a day when war comes to Truskolasy. When it does, we need as many capable combatants as we can muster to even have a chance at offsetting the population advantage our neighbors hold over us. Therefore, our continued survival depends upon the ability to mobilize our people into combat. To ensure this, from now on, every club will keep a detailed list of their supporters, noting all those who are eligible for enlistment, and maintain a storage of weapons and supplies on their grounds. Each month, selected members will undergo a week of basic training so that when our enemies attempt to invade our lands, the citizens of the ZWKT can take up arms and repel them back across the border."
BRZ_have_faith_in_hooligans: "Have Faith in Hooligans"
BRZ_have_faith_in_hooligans_desc: "If we can’t pacify them, why not utilize them instead? We could kill two birds with one stone and get the Ultras off our streets, unleashing their fury on our enemies. While most recruits quiver in their boots at the mere mention of frontline action, these fanatics will seek out combat on their own, forming some of the most ruthless and brutal units this region has ever seen. All it would take is giving the hooligans a share of the spoils and free reign to deal with our foes as they please. Surely it won’t hurt us too much to turn a blind eye to their conduct from time to time."
BRZ_professional_fighting_squads: "Professional Fighting Squads"
BRZ_professional_fighting_squads_desc: "Bar none, early reports from the training fields all reach the Supreme Coach’s desk with one conclusion: in their present state our militias are completely unsuited for any combat activity and fully expected to crumble against any competent military force. The Znicz sector estimates that their units would be able to hold the line for a few hours at most, before being overwhelmed and rendered nonoperational – and somehow that represents one of the more positive evaluations we’ve received. If we are to have any chance at defending our territory, our current armed rabble must be brought to the standards of a professional army. No more light target practice and jolly chatter with their fellow recruits. From now on the men of the ZWKT will learn the meaning of the word discipline. They’ll thank us when it ends up saving their lives on the battlefield."
BRZ_show_of_brutal_force: "Show of Brutal Force"
BRZ_show_of_brutal_force_desc: "It’s time to let our dogs off their leashes and release the Ultras onto the lands of Częstochowa. Sowing a bit of panic in the area should be enough to deter the Archdiocese from any attack on our territory, giving us ample breathing room for the next stage of operations. Honoring our pact with the hooligans and letting them run rampant, free from our oversight, should be enough to ensure their loyalty in the coming conflicts. After all, they have no reason to bite off the hand that feeds them."
BRZ_every_man_a_footballer: "Every Man a Footballer, Every Footballer a Soldier"
BRZ_every_man_a_footballer_desc: "The success of our military operations depends on the utmost solidarity between every citizen. The troops on the frontline rely on the continued support of the workers back home, ensuring they can count on an unending supply of equipment. With the need for the adequate supply of our new army requiring backbreaking work to be met, in order to maintain morale, we’ll organize the assembly lines of our munitions factories in a way that groups supporters of the same team together, guaranteeing them that the products of their labor go to troops representing their club. That way, the people they toil to supply in combat will no longer be unnamed strangers, but comrades they share the stands with each week."
BRZ_crusade_of_supreme_coach: "Crusade of Supreme Coach"
BRZ_crusade_of_supreme_coach_desc: "Perpetually overlooked and underdeveloped, it didn’t take a single German shell to bring our region into complete ruin. As soon as aid from Częstochowa ceased to arrive, the imbalances of the local hierarchy became abundantly clear. While the wealthy seized upon their chance and left, taking their money with them, the regular folk were left to fend for themselves. With no guiding hand, economic activity has been reduced to simply ensuring subsistence, and many couldn’t even achieve that. If there is to be any hope for a better tomorrow, Jerzy Brzęczek must find a way to put the territory back on its feet, or else the people’s patience towards his leadership may soon run out."
BRZ_destroy_biedronka: "Destroy Biedronka Supermarkets"
BRZ_destroy_biedronka_desc: "For nearly a decade now a fury has raged inside the Supreme Coach’s heart, born from a number of defeats against his nemesis – Portugal. Each time he faced them ended with another humiliating loss, further destroying his credibility as a tactical mastermind. Even now, a portion of our enemy remains within our lands, masquerading as one of Poland’s most prominent enterprises. They may feel safe for now, but we see through their lies, and we won’t rest until the last Biedronka turns to rubble."
BRZ_reopening_erg_klobuck: "Force Reopening of ERG Kłobuck"
BRZ_reopening_erg_klobuck_desc: "For decades ERG has faithfully served the people of Kłobuck, providing the populace with much-needed employment opportunities. Their factories now lie dormant, bankruptcy having halted all production nearly twenty years ago. The vast, empty halls serve as perfect grounds for jump-starting our non-existent industry, re-focusing their production to all kinds of equipment - kits, balls, and the like – goods that are not only necessary within our state but ones that with a bit of luck we could export to other warlords. Under our wing, ERG’s new iteration is bound to provide the region with unparalleled wealth."
BRZ_every_school_a_club: "Every School a Football Club"
BRZ_every_school_a_club_desc: "While it may sound tempting to direct the majority of our funds into quenching our need for immediate reinforcements, we must by no means neglect the youngest generation. The sad fact is that despite the country being home to thousands of footballers, most of them are virtually useless, having the technique of a plank of wood. And there are only so many tricks those old dogs can learn. Given that our schools are already unable to perform most of their duties due to material shortages, why not give the children another choice? We shall build an Orlik next to every school and enforce mandatory training for our youngest players. With just enough focus and the right coaches, we will foster a new generation with football firmly in their blood that will finally surpass Górski’s Eagles."
BRZ_zwkt_supplies: "ZWKT Takes Over Supplies"
BRZ_zwkt_supplies_desc: "Our seizure of Biedronka left us with vast quantities of goods previously hoarded by the damned company. Thousands within the region starve as mountains of unsold products expire within their countless warehouses just because they couldn’t be used to turn a profit. With our newly acquired means, we’re finally able to relieve the population of its plight, redistributing the supplies in a great show of our goodwill. The now-empty stores will serve as distribution centers, from which everyday supply trucks will emerge to ensure that no fan ever has to worry about going to bed on an empty stomach, even in the most remote corners of the nation."
BRZ_zwkt_industry: "ZWKT Takes Over Industries"
BRZ_zwkt_industry_desc: "As rumblings of instability began to rock the struggling Polish Republic, foreign capital began to flee the nation, fearful of losing their property and funds in the chaos of unrest. As a result of this exodus, the majority of factories and warehouses find themselves abandoned, their ownership unclear as a result of numerous panic sales. As the sole somewhat legitimate authority within the region, we are well within our rights to requisition these complexes and finally put the people back to work once more. And whilst we can hardly compare ourselves to the industrial powerhouses of Zagłębie, we’ll make sure that everything a Truskolasy resident needs can be produced right in his hometown."
BRZ_zwkt_infrastructure: "ZWKT Takes Over Infrastructure"
BRZ_zwkt_infrastructure_desc: "Lacking any major cities, our little corner of the region has always been one neglected by both the central and state governments. As a result, you’d be hard-pressed to find a solitary road with more than a single lane connecting our towns. While this has been enough for the backward life previously enjoyed by our citizens, it’s hardly befitting of the grandest up-and-coming footballing center on Polish soil. Now that we finally have the means to develop our lands, we shall remedy this situation and build a truly modern infrastructural foundation, funneling all young players with a dream of a better life right into Truskolasy."
BRZ_introduction_of_clubism: "Introduction of Clubism"
BRZ_introduction_of_clubism_desc: "At last, we have built a state adherent to Brzęczek’s vision. Together with the owners, players, and leading supporters of the territory's major clubs, as well as our closest advisors, we are ready to officially sign and codify the principles of our founding ideology - Clubism. A uniting force, encompassing nominal rivals under the single banner of the ZWKT, it allows us to rise above the divisions of class, religion, and, most importantly, team affiliation. We are all brothers, and under the Supreme Coach's benevolent guidance we work for a better future, so that everyone, no matter their standing in life, can share in the glory we'll bring to Polish football."
BRZ_send_envoy_to_lubliniec: "Send Envoy to Lubliniec"
BRZ_send_envoy_to_lubliniec_desc: "It's time. While we can hardly label our uncoordinated band of amateurs as anywhere close to ready to take up the national team's mantle, we simply don't have the comfort of waiting for Brzęczek's methods to slowly mold them into professionals. A storm is about to engulf Poland, and if we don't get going soon, we might just end up missing our only chance at survival. Luckily, the commandoes over in Lubliniec have always been somewhat amicable to our endeavors. If we can get them to assemble a makeshift team, we could technically label the resulting match as our squad's first official international showing. Despite our detractors' claims, we are two separate independent states, after all. We just have to hope they end up accepting our proposal because finding a replacement amongst a sea of bloodthirsty warlords certainly won't be easy."
BRZ_match_day: "Match Day!"
BRZ_match_day_desc: "The fateful day has come. Today, we will write history. Though the quality both on and off the pitch leaves much to be desired, a far cry from the impressive conditions we once so often took for granted, the spectacle about to unfold represents the triumphal culmination of months of our hard work and dedication. We have transformed overgrown pitches and ruined stands into proper stadiums, futureless youths into aspiring footballers, and instilled a newfound hope into the minds of ZWKT's citizens. This day is a celebration of our achievements but also the start of a new wave of challenges. So let's give everyone gathered one hell of a showing because this result will forever stand in the history books, marking the beginning of our journey. The whole region is watching on with bated breath. We better not screw this up."
BRZ_truskolasy_top: "TRUSKOLASY TOP!"
BRZ_truskolasy_top_desc: "Was there ever any doubt? With the Supreme Coach's masterful leadership, we have managed to completely overwhelm the commandoes' defense. If anything, the result does little to portray the sheer scale of the thrashing we gave them, but had we pressed them any harder, it might have become painfully clear that most of our opponents probably hadn't played a proper match in over a decade. Still, a win is a win, and this one feels particularly gratifying. We've shown the whole footballing world that we are not to be pushed around. Now that we've successfully put ourselves back on the map, it's time to hit the training ground and capitalize on our recent momentum. Our future opponents won't roll over quite like those guys did. It only gets harder from here."
BRZ_we_will_get_them_anyway: "We Will Get Them Anyway..."
BRZ_we_will_get_them_anyway_desc: "We... lost. Despite all the preparations, despite facing quite possibly the weakest side in the entire region, we lost. And in what way? They get one lucky goal from a dubious penalty and then park the bus for the entire second half. That's not what we agreed! It was supposed to be our celebration! Instead, we have just added another chapter to the national team's extensive list of shameful defeats. Except this one stings even worse than all the others. Great job lads. We have become the laughingstock of the entire country. Though they've dealt a heavy blow to our prestige, it seems those cheating commandos don't know who they're messing with. Let them cheer their unearned victory, thinking they have bested us. They have crossed us for the last time."
BRZ_demand_submission: "Demand Submission"
BRZ_demand_submission_desc: "Now that the on-field matters have been dealt with, it's time to get back to politics. Kukuła's men have played their part brilliantly but they have since outgrown their usefulness. If anything, some more... ambitious circles within Lubliniec have even started advocating reeling us into their sphere of influence. As if we're just going to let that happen! Their clique has no grander vision; no plan to help the people of Poland. All they would do is sideline us, use us as a source of cheap entertainment while the commandoes fight the real battles. We must put them in their place before such ideas fully take root. Either they'll join us, or we'll have to resort to less pleasant solutions."
BRZ_send_the_hooligans: "Send the Hooligans"
BRZ_send_the_hooligans_desc: "So, they have chosen the warpath. How fitting. While attacking the commandoes head-on would practically be a suicide mission, we do have tools at our disposal to make the task at least somewhat manageable. For a while now, we have kept our bloodthirsty ultras in reserve, but it seems we have no choice but to utilize them. We'll deploy them along our southern frontier, and in the dark of night, they shall wreak havoc in our enemies' formations, destabilizing and softening their defense before our frontline units even have the chance to cross the border. Hopefully, they don't go... too far. We don't want to be seen as ruthless savages."
BRZ_march_on_lubliniec: "March on Lubliniec"
BRZ_march_on_lubliniec_desc: "We're ready. Our southern neighbors are still reeling from our raid. Somehow, the hooligans ended up being too effective, completely decimating their defensive positions in a gruesome show of force and brutality. They're rapidly growing out of control and might soon have to be curtailed, but for now, we have to capitalize on the carnage they've created. Before the commandoes have any chance to rally their forces, we will march on Lubliniec, our glorious advance illuminated by the blinding glow of a sea of flares. Given that they're practically at our mercy, hopefully, they lay down their arms and don't end up giving us too much trouble. Regardless of their current sorry state, their units are still battle-tested professional battalions. If they see through our tricks, things might get messy."

BRZ_pilgrimage_to_czestochowa_desc: "Though we've long avoided their threatening gaze, we have no choice but to face our mighty eastern rival. Despite our recent advancements, the Archdiocese still sees us as a relatively weak target, so if we don't strike first, we might soon end up fighting the brunt of their overwhelming force. While the Archbishop's inner circle likely won't be keen to tie the future of their state to the result of some amateur football match, we'll present them with an offer simply too good to pass up. They're well aware of the strength of their team and the weakness of ours. They think their victory would be all but assured. If we promise to fully surrender our sovereignty in case of a loss, they're bound to throw all caution to the wind and agree to a deal. Their hubris will be their ultimate undoing."
BRZ_rakow_czestochowa_match_desc: "There's no backing down now. While the current pitiful state of the once-mighty Raków poignantly represents our country's ruin, the team still stands as the most recognizable and respected club in the entire region. Even without their star players and million-dollar transfers, the former national champions' rump squad is nothing to scoff at, especially when compared to our own. Through its sheer fame and notoriety, Raków still effortlessly attracts Jura's top talents, leaving us to deal with their unwanted scraps. If we are ever to break their monopoly, this might be our only chance. One thing is beyond doubt - in this match, we're going to be massive underdogs. The ZWKT's entire existence depending on the outcome doesn't help either. We'll need a near-perfect performance, a good deal of luck, and any advantage, legal or not, that we can possibly get. The coming 90 minutes will be the most stressful in the Supreme Coach's whole career, but with the right approach, we might be able to pull through. If not, going back on our agreement with the Archdiocese won't be so simple."
BRZ_incorporation_of_czestochowa_clubs_desc: "We've done it! The footballing giants of Częstochowa lie at our mercy, and now, to the victors, the spoils shall go. The incorporation of Raków and Skra should, in itself, not be that difficult of a task; at least the city's previous government had the right mind to leave the teams largely untouched by its ideology. The real question is, just how much of their squads do we keep for ourselves in the process? Even in its reduced state, Raków is bound to remain a fearsome rival. If we fail to cut them down to size, they'll likely run away with the NSFL title. As tempting as it may sound, fully stripping them for parts is also out of the question. It seems no matter what approach we decide on, some group is bound to be displeased. It's just a matter of who, if anyone, we can currently afford to piss off."
BRZ_role_of_church_desc: "The Church's role in our country's downfall is undeniable. Left unchecked, it wraps its greedy tendrils around the governing apparatus, and we have no doubts that should we ever lose our vigilance, it would do the same to us. Though ideally, we'd sideline the religious authorities entirely, our core base of supporters is known to be quite... god-fearing in its own perverted way. Despite acting in complete defiance of all Christian values, the ultras constantly surround themselves with performative displays of their supposed piety and regard the faith as one of the main pillars of their creed. If we make any moves against the religious establishment, their ravenous mob is all but guaranteed to riot. It seems we have no choice but to let the Church be, albeit with a degree of state control. If they want to bless our players to ensure 'divine favor' before every match, so be it. Having to maintain fake cordiality is a small price to pay for internal peace."

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_JERZY_BRZECZEK_DESC: "Jerzy Brzęczek did not have an easy life and not just because of the collapse of the country. The latter he accepted with the hope that it would wipe clean the stain on his honor. Even so, his name was still a symbol of mediocrity in Poland. However, the Truskolasy, where he had arrived after the Fall, severely regretted this carelessness. With the help of the militias of the teams that came with him, he overthrew the remnants of the former administration, and appointed the ZWKT with himself as the Supreme Coach. \nNow, people form clubs where they eat, drink, work and exercise to develop their football skills. In Brzęczek's state, there is no room for lollygagging and the two biggest crimes of thought - Peszkism (hedonism and alcoholism) and Nawalkism (corruption, lies, lack of ideology and shallowness), and any mentions of former football coaches were erased from the books, together with those who destroyed Polish football the most - The dreaded Portuguese... \nEveryone else were descripted as spirit-lacking lackeys of Polish Association, which in fact was to blame for everything wrong that happened to Brzęczek's life. \n\nBut that shall change, and the Supreme Coach will carry us to victory with his iron hand! \n\nBrothers and Sisters, march to the field! Each of us is a representative from now on!"

unification.19.desc: "Goal for Truskolasy! Despite none of the bookmakers having dared to put money on them before the war, the Free Club Association managed to seize the entire territory of Zagłębie and Jura. Today, at the New People's Stadium in Sosnowiec, the victorious Jerzy Brzęczek spoke to a combined crowd of players and citizens, inaugurating the Triumphal Match between Olimpia Truskolasy and the National Team. Even with a murderous season behind them, the Supreme Coach’s boyhood club was able to beat the fledgling side 3-0 amongst a sea of ideological propaganda symbolizing the union of all football clubs under the banner of the TFCA. It seems that Clubism has truly created its own unique strain of socialist thought, embarking on an uncharted path, however, fans still have reason to worry, as the result has painfully exposed the shortcomings of the National Team revival project.\n\nA spot in the knockout stages secured, but at what cost?"
unification.19.a: "Campeones, Campeones, Ole Ole Ole?"
