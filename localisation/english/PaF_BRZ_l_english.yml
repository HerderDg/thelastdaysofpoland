 ##Characters##
POLITICS_JERZY_BRZECZEK_DESC: "Jerzy Brzęczek did not have an easy life and not just because the collapse of the country. The latter he accepted with the hope that it would wipe clean his stain on the honor. Even so, his name was still a symbol of mediocrity in Poland. However, the Truskolasy, where he had arrived after the Fall, severely regretted this carelessness. With the help of the militias of the teams that came with him, he overthrew the remnants of the former administration, and appointed the ZWKT with himself as the Supreme Coach. People are now forming clubs where they eat, drink, work and exercise to develop their football skills. There is no room for lollygagging and the two biggest crimes of thought - peszkism (hedonism and alcoholism) and nawalkism (corruption, lies, lack of ideology and shallowness). Former coaches were erased from the books and especially one who destroyed polish football most - The Portuguese. Everyone else were descripted as a spirit-lacking lackeys of Polish Association, which in fact was to blame for everything wrong that happened to Brzęczek's life. \n\n But that will change, and the Supreme Coach will carry us to victory with his iron hand! \n\n Brothers and Sisters, march to the field! Each of us is a representative from now on!"
