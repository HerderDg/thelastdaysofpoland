unification.107.desc: "Shocking news emerges from Southern Mazovia, as following a coup by a mercenary group of arms dealers, the entirety of the region has found itself under bandit rule. The state’s population, used to an undisturbed existence in what once was the country’s enclave of stability, the only territory dominated by moderate civilian administrations, has now been relegated to a life of fear under Dadak’s regime. The voivodeship’s new masters hold no pretenses of caring about Poland’s future. In fact, they’d wish to drag out the current chaos as long as possible, selling weapons to all sides until their pockets overfill. Since coming to power, the clique has reoriented production from civilian goods towards military production, forcing the common citizens to survive on whatever resources remain, yet while the bandits may violently quell all voices of dissent, the situation is quickly approaching a boiling point, with a famine threatening to engulf the region."
