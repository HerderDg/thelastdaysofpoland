generic_last_days_of_poland:0 "Last Days of Poland"
generic_last_days_of_poland_desc:0 "Our country is on the brink of destruction. Poland, our beloved homeland, has been invaded and defeated by the damned Germans!\n\nThe entire country, or rather what's left of it, is now a wasteland full of mad warlords with their own visions and plans, but we, the true successors... we will not surrender! We will regain and save our compatriots! We will bravely walk through the valley of darkness, even through sweat and blood, we will regain our lost nation! Poland has not yet perished while we live! What foreign force has taken from us, we will reclaim with sword or weapon!"
generic_experiences_of_the_fall:0 "Experiences of the Fall"
generic_experiences_of_the_fall_desc:0 "The lost battle during the European Intervention made us realize we needed a new strategy. The problem is that we have something that doesn't resemble our former army, but an ordinary, angry mob of civilians. We must learn from this painful time and adapt, otherwise the law of the jungle will decide our fate. Let's find books, find inspiration, and a series of strategies; this will be useful to our commanders who will lead the army to victory! A strong state means a strong army. We are animals, and this is our nature; kill or be killed!"
generic_increase_the_conscription:0 "Increase the Conscription"
generic_increase_the_conscription_desc:0 "If we want an army, we need people willing to sacrifice themselves for their country. While there are always willing and unwilling, we can always reach both sides when it comes to the survival of their families and our country. Therefore, we will launch a mobilization campaign for those who can be useful in the fight. And whoever doesn't fight, let them work; without mutual cooperation, our country won't last long. Sometimes we will convince them with words, sometimes with force, but this is necessary if we want to live to see tomorrow. Our ancestors, who also fought, would have wanted us to demonstrate heroism during the fall of our nation."

generic_train_our_troops:0 "Train our Troops"
generic_train_our_troops_desc:0 "Our army, unfortunately, is composed mostly of ordinary civilians who are now expected to take up arms, go into battle, and sometimes even kill their own former neighbors. It's not enough for these people that it's either us or them; we must train them to understand the basics, to be fit and ready to fight, to help their comrades in arms, and even to become future commanders leading their troops to victory. The better we train them, the greater the chance they'll survive and win the confrontation with our enemies! Okay, gentlemen, now you're going to run 2 kilometers and do 40 push-ups, MOVE, MOVE!!!"
generic_homemade_equipment:0 "Homemade Equipment"
generic_homemade_equipment_desc:0 "The European intervention, coupled with the fact that our country has been disarmed for years, has left us with a hopeless situation, with weapons that barely resemble weapons. Purchasing weapons from abroad isn't enough; we must produce our own equipment to ensure our soldiers have the necessary defense. Therefore, from now on, every stick, kitchen knife, or even an old air rifle will be handcrafted, utilizing creative DIY enthusiasts who will craft weapons in makeshift workshops! Over time, the more we learn, the better our weapons will become. Starting from scratch will never be easy, but a small step forward is a big step for our survival."
generic_guns_and_butter:0 "Guns&Butter"
generic_guns_and_butter_desc:0 "Supply, no matter how you look at it, is one of the key elements of military life. An army without food, ammunition, or new weapons won't survive long in a war situation, and even the best commanders, like Napoleon, can't do anything against an army without supplies. To prevent "there's nothing we can do" scenarios, we must carefully plan the quantity and quality of our supplies. It would also be worthwhile to expand rail lines and vehicles for supply delivery. And if we plan everything well, everything will run smoothly in the uncertain future that awaits us all."

generic_emergency_workshops:0 "Emergency Workshops"
generic_emergency_workshops_desc:0 "The economic situation is critical! Our economy is ground to nothing, a pile of rubble and stones thanks to a lost war. Since the world won't save us, we must take matters into our own hands before things get any worse! To produce anything, we need factories, which are currently closed or damaged. And since electricity barely exists in our patch of land, it's high time to build emergency workshops to produce weapons and combat equipment for soldiers. Without this crucial foundation, our chances of survival are close to zero. A good start to a stable economy that will ensure our survival!"
generic_scavenging_for_food:0 "Scavenging for Food"
generic_scavenging_for_food_desc:0 "Our country is in the state of anarchy, and civilians are beginning to starve and worry about the future. The war has caused many people to flee and leave behind their belongings. In this situation, if we don't want to be devoured by the hungry crowd, we must search for food. We will search every abandoned house, shop, and hangar for every morsel of food for our compatriots! It's already a scarce commodity, so if we believe we can not only feed our country but also share it with the less fortunate during such a difficult time, something we could never have imagined until recently."
generic_longing_for_the_energy:0 "Longing for the Energy"
generic_longing_for_the_energy_desc:0 "Energy, electricity, is humanity's most important invention in the 21st century. Without it, we don't have most of the things we need, and without electricity, our country will be sliding into an abyss we don't want to be in! That's why we'll search every abandoned IT store, warehouse, power plant, and even home, looking for generators, batteries, or anything that will keep us energetically alive! Without electricity, not only will we be unable to build anything or build anything efficient, but our lives will be much worse, and none of us wants to return to caves, right?"
generic_patching_the_budget_hole:0 "Patching the Budget Hole"
generic_patching_the_budget_hole_desc:0 "The financial situation is, one could say, in agony. The currency and economic crisis, with hyperinflation before the collapse, and finally the disintegration of Poland, has meant that if we are to build or buy anything, we desperately need money, which we literally don't have. Therefore, we will begin collecting taxes from our citizens and finding ways to earn money through sales or trade. We will search every place that holds money. Since no one holds it, we will exploit it. And since we have no intention of becoming a tribe, and a state without money is bankrupt, no longer existing in the wider world, there is no way out. Time for a tax inspection!"
generic_anything_we_have_to_offer:0 "Anything We Have To Offer"
generic_anything_we_have_to_offer_desc:0 "Free markets... trade, they say, always solve all problems if you have something to offer. We have raw materials, food, and smaller treasures to trade. If we bargain well and flexibly, we have a greater chance of making a profit, and the richer we are, the stronger our state will be. Perhaps we can even buy ourselves time to prepare for the worst ahead? We can build a future with trade, but we must approach it cleverly; otherwise, we will be consumed by the invisible hand of the market, or by other warlords who have done better than us. We'll roll the dice and see how this gambit plays out..."
generic_anything_we_can_dig_out:0 "Anything We Can Dig Out"
generic_anything_we_can_dig_out_desc:0 "In a world where everyone has the same goal as us, there's no point in trading with warlords who will conquer us or us! Therefore, we will secure our future by mining as many resources as possible, looting all the scrap, garbage, and other essential materials we need to create anything. The more we keep these resources with us, the more we will produce in our fields, and then we will be more prepared for any scenario that befalls us. It's either us or them. Time to dig as much as we can, or the world will dig our grave!"
