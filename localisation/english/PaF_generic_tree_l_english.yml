paf_generic.8.t: "Ground Control to Major Tom"
paf_generic.8.desc: "- This is gonna end badly. - the pilot thought to himself. He saw how the test flight ended before they even began. In the explosion of fire. Now things could go the same way, but with him instead of the dummy, it was him inside the cockpit with a space suit and all. A sacrificial lamb for a megalomaniac who lorded over him and his compatriots.\n- At least up there I'll be free from anyone's rule.\nHe tried to cycle through all the ways the eggheads tried to calm him with. But for every one of their arguments, he found one of his own.\n- We're about 6 degrees northwards from Baikonur and 23 degrees northwards from Cape Canaveral! - He remembered one of his outbursts - And I know that's how the space race started, but having weapon designers, whose rockets are supposed to hit targets and explode, isn't too reassuring.\nEven if everything goes all right, he won't get to do all the fun stuff like landing on a celestial body to nip off a gram of soil. No, his task is to 'consistently continue the programme'. That means this whole endeavour is one propaganda. At least the whole thing was simple in its objective. Fly through the atmosphere and descend with the help of the parachutes.\n- We've got one minute to start - the voice from the speaker announced.\nHe looked at the controls on his pulpit, remembering which lights show if he's in danger. He also gave a long look at a photo of his wife. He did it all for her. The money he'll earn with this one stunt will put all their worries to rest.\n- 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2...\nThere was no going back.\n1...\nThe engine roared, and the launch clamps let go. Sooner than the pilot realised he was above the clouds. He clicked the button to eject the lower engine along with its now-empty tank. No fires, no turbulences, no jammed electronics. Just steady flight in a spacecraft that grew smaller and smaller with each ejection, for the most effective use of the force of thrust. He soon found himself in just a capsule that couldn't go any faster. But that was enough. He's flown above all the layers of the atmosphere. In fact, he flew further than expected. He was up in the cosmos and only now realised the opportunity he had.\n- I'm going through the door - he announced to the ground control.\nHe went outside and looked at Earth. He took a photo of the planet. Up here, there were no divisions on the map. No civil wars. Though he doubted, most of his compatriots would have the same reflection."
paf_generic.8.a: "They'll probably think it's time to conquer space as well"

Therefore, we will launch a mobilization campaign for those who can be useful in the fight. And whoever doesn't fight, let them work; without mutual cooperation, our country won't last long. Sometimes we will convince them with words, sometimes with force, but this is necessary if we want to live to see tomorrow. Our ancestors, who also fought, would have wanted us to demonstrate heroism during the fall of our nation."

By investing in our aerial capabilities, we can protect our interests, expand our reach, and assert our presence in the skies. Let's soar towards a brighter future, where our nation thrives both on land and in the air."

generic_break_the_resistance: "Break the Resistance"
generic_break_the_resistance_desc: "There will always be resistance. Those who oppose our rule, whether out of loyalty to the old order or simply out of fear and uncertainty, will seek to undermine our efforts to rebuild. To ensure the stability and security of our newly acquired territories, we must conduct thorough anti-partisan operations. This involves identifying and neutralizing insurgent groups, securing key infrastructure, and winning the hearts and minds of the local population. By demonstrating our commitment to order and progress, we can reduce resistance and foster a sense of unity within our borders."

generic_un_recognition: "United Nations Recognition!"
generic_un_recognition_desc: "We have achieved a significant milestone in our journey towards international legitimacy. The United Nations has officially recognized our nation, granting us a seat at the global table. This recognition not only affirms our sovereignty but also opens doors for diplomatic relations, trade opportunities, and access to international aid and support. As we move forward, let's leverage this newfound status to strengthen our position on the world stage and work towards a brighter future for our citizens."

generic_true_poland_desc: "We are the rightful heirs of this land. Our history, culture, and identity are deeply rooted in these territories, and we stand as the only true state representing the will of our people. In the face of challenges and opposition, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to preserving our sovereignty and upholding the values that define us. Let us unite as one nation, proud of our heritage and determined to build a future that honors our past."
generic_fighting_for_legit: "The War for Recognition"
generic_fighting_for_legit_desc: "We are engaged in a struggle for legitimacy on the international stage. Our nation has faced numerous challenges and obstacles, but we remain resolute in our pursuit of recognition and respect from the global community. Through diplomatic efforts, strategic alliances, and a commitment to upholding international norms, we can demonstrate our worthiness as a sovereign state. Let us continue to fight for our rightful place among the nations of the world, knowing that our perseverance will ultimately lead to success."

generic_last_days_of_poland_desc: "Not long ago, beyond the mountains, beyond the forests, there was a country called Poland, unfortunately pride led to its downfall. Now we are in a lonely wasteland among the ruins of the dark ages, now our task is to survive what awaits us! We came here with our own mission and vision, a very difficult, brave journey full of challenges awaits us, but we will never give up! The beginnings of history have never been easy, but our determined purpose will lead us straight to the horizon! Time to rise like a phoenix from the ashes!"
generic_experiences_of_the_fall: "Experiences of the Fall"
generic_experiences_of_the_fall_desc: "Recently, there have been many drastic events that we have more or less witnessed, and we realize that a new combat strategy is needed, which we will follow. The problem is that we have something that doesn't resemble our former army, but an ordinary, angry mob of civilians. We must learn from this painful time and adapt, otherwise the law of the jungle will decide our fate. Let's find books, find inspiration, and a series of strategies; this will be useful to our commanders who will lead the army to victory! A strong state means a strong army. We are animals, and this is our nature; kill or be killed!"
generic_increase_the_conscription: "Increase the Conscription"
generic_increase_the_conscription_desc: "Pretty much everybody wants us to unify the region, but almost no one is ready to fight and die for it. There can be no victory without sacrifice, so if that sacrifice doesn't willingly pick itself, we'll have to be the ones making the choice for them. There are still plenty of healthy young lads we can siphon off from our territories and induct into the army. Who knows, maybe they'll end up liking it there and eventually rise through the ranks once they get enough experience. If something happens to them along the way... well, our cause always has room for additional martyrs."
generic_handpick_the_officers: "Handpick the Officers"
generic_handpick_the_officers_desc: "A body is only as capable as the brain that leads it, that much is certain. Therefore, we must focus on picking the correct generals, both from previously present military bodies as well as above-averagely-trained individuals, in order to lead our army. While this will take resources away from the training of our troops, it's better to have competent leadership and incompetent troops than competent troops and incompetent leadership."
generic_train_our_troops: "Train our Troops"
generic_train_our_troops_desc: "Our army, unfortunately, is composed mostly of ordinary civilians who are now expected to take up arms, go into battle, and sometimes even kill their own former neighbors. It's not enough for these people that it's either us or them; we must train them to understand the basics, to be fit and ready to fight, to help their comrades in arms, and even to become future commanders leading their troops to victory. The better we train them, the greater the chance they'll survive and win the confrontation with our enemies! Okay, gentlemen, now you're going to run 2 kilometers and do 40 push-ups, MOVE, MOVE!!!"
generic_homemade_equipment: "Homemade Equipment"
generic_homemade_equipment_desc: "Well, what was once Poland is certain to have been terribly disarmed and pathetically prepared for the collapse that has left us now with a hopeless situation, with weapons that barely resemble weapons. Purchasing weapons from abroad isn't enough; we must produce our own equipment to ensure our soldiers have the necessary defense. Therefore, from now on, every stick, kitchen knife, or even an old air rifle will be handcrafted, utilizing creative DIY enthusiasts who will craft weapons in makeshift workshops! Over time, the more we learn, the better our weapons will become. Starting from scratch will never be easy, but a small step forward is a big step for our survival."
generic_guns_and_butter: "Guns and Butter"
generic_guns_and_butter_desc: "Supply, no matter how you look at it, is one of the key elements of military life. An army without food, ammunition, or new weapons won't survive long in a war situation, and even the best commanders, like Napoleon, can't do anything against an army without supplies. To prevent \"there's nothing we can do\" scenarios, we must carefully plan the quantity and quality of our supplies. It would also be worthwhile to expand rail lines and vehicles for supply delivery. And if we plan everything well, everything will run smoothly in the uncertain future that awaits us all."
generic_origins_of_the_getarmyname: "[GetLocGenArmyFocus]"
generic_origins_of_the_getarmyname_desc: "To survive the coming storm, our movement requires a strong, capable army. Luckily, we can count on the determination of our finest, who will carry the flame as we fight against our neighbors. There is a passion that guides them - one that cannot be found in just any other national military. We are guided by an ideological fervor. It gives our soldiers a sense of a mission, but it also serves as a lesson that forms the backbone of our units' structure. We would be wise to remember it going forward, for it is our unique gift that gives us an edge over the others."
generic_condition_of_the_getname: "Condition of the [ROOT.GetName]"
generic_condition_of_the_getname_desc: "Let's face it: times are bad, they're worse than bad, they're crazy! A złoty buys a groszy's worth (if anything at all more than a piece of string and a kick in the ass), and the food is unfit to breathe and the air unsafe to eat. That's why we need to, coloquially speaking, get our shit together, and figure out what to do with this mess. Actually organising the government to deal with the problems of the current situation is a good first step, setting up departments and ministries to deal with existing problems will surely help us get back on our feet and ready to roll with the punches of fate."
generic_meeting_of_the_getrulingparty: "Meeting of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty]"
generic_meeting_of_the_getrulingparty_desc: "It's time for a meeting with the most important figures in the party. We need to determine who is doing what and how we should manage the state during this time of chaos and turmoil in our region. The meeting will also aim to prepare the ground for the future of our government and what promises we will make to our residents. Ultimately, we also want to cultivate party loyalty that will maintain the stable government necessary to keep our country in check. Without a united government, there's no hope of rallying citizens behind the common cause of our new nation. Where one goes, we all go!"
generic_ideological_dogmas_of_getrulingideology: "Ideological Dogmas of [ROOT.GetSubideologyText]"
generic_ideological_dogmas_of_getrulingideology_desc: "We have an idea we want to pass on to future generations, but how can we express our dreams for realization? At the meeting, we will tell our residents what kind of future we are planning for them. We are convinced that our idea will solve all social, economic, and national problems! While this is one small step for man, it is a giant leap for our country. An idea is the fuel that will give us purpose in a hopeless world."
generic_country_on_the_collision_course: "Country on the Collision Course"
generic_country_on_the_collision_course_desc: "Unfortunately, the times of peace were short-lived. Tensions with warlords are rising through endless areas and even in our region; war is inevitable! Therefore, we will ensure the safety of our citizens and prepare for every scenario; otherwise, we will wake up with our hands in the potty, something no one wants! We must firmly accept reality. The fight for survival will not end until this country is whole again. Now we will have to defend ourselves. With blood and sweat, courage and determination in the darkest of times, we will win this conflict together, united!"
generic_improve_the_administration: "Improve the Administration"
generic_improve_the_administration_desc: "Our state can't run on an ideological vision alone. Taxes won't collect themselves, and decrees won't automatically become reality. In order to competently govern the lands under our control, we'll need to establish a functioning, multi-level administration. It's the only way to prove that we are not absent-minded conquerors but that we're capable of bringing order to Poland. There's no better way of gaining legitimacy than establishing government structures that will serve as a model for all our future territories."
generic_emergency_workshops: "Emergency Workshops"
generic_emergency_workshops_desc: "The economic situation is critical! Our economy is ground to nothing, a pile of rubble and stones thanks to a total collapse of this country' whole economical network. Since the world won't save us, we must take matters into our own hands before things get any worse! To produce anything, we need factories, which are currently closed or damaged. And since electricity is very scarce in this patch of land, it's high time to build emergency workshops to produce weapons and combat equipment for soldiers. Without this crucial foundation, our chances of survival are close to zero. A good start to a stable economy that will ensure our survival!"
generic_scavenging_for_food: "Scavenging for Food"
generic_scavenging_for_food_desc: "Our country is not in very good shape, and civilians are starting to get hungry and worry about the future. The war has caused many people to flee and leave behind their belongings. In this situation, if we don't want to be devoured by the hungry crowd, we must search for food. We will search every abandoned house, shop, and warehouse for every morsel of food for our compatriots! It's already a scarce commodity, so if we believe we can not only feed our country but also share it with the less fortunate during such a difficult time, something we could never have imagined until recently."
generic_longing_for_the_energy: "Longing for the Energy"
generic_longing_for_the_energy_desc: "Unless we plan on returning to a pre-industrial age, we need power, and we need it fast. Some of our enemies have already equipped themselves with makeshift generators, and it's better not to think about those who managed to get their hands on a working power plant. So far, we've been far less fortunate. At this point, we'll take anything just to keep the lights on at night. A few years ago, we lived in the golden age of technology. Nowadays, we celebrate any still-working device like some awe-inspiring rarity. Such a situation cannot be allowed to stand."
generic_patching_the_budget_hole: "Patching the Budget Hole"
generic_patching_the_budget_hole_desc: "The financial situation is, one could say, in agony. The currency and economic crisis, with hyperinflation before the collapse, and finally the disintegration of Poland, has meant that if we are to build or buy anything, we desperately need money, which we literally don't have. Therefore, we will begin collecting taxes from our citizens and finding ways to earn money through sales or trade. We will search every place that holds money. Since no one holds it, we will exploit it. And since we have no intention of becoming a tribe, and a state without money is bankrupt, no longer existing in the wider world, there is no way out. Time for a tax inspection!"
generic_anything_we_have_to_offer: "Anything We Have To Offer"
generic_anything_we_have_to_offer_desc: "Free market... trade, they say, always solves all problems if you have something to offer. We have raw materials, food, and smaller treasures to trade. If we bargain well and flexibly, we have a greater chance of making a profit, and the richer we are, the stronger our state will be. Perhaps we can even buy ourselves time to prepare for the worst ahead? We can build a future with trade, but we must approach it cleverly; otherwise, we will be consumed by the invisible hand of the market, or by other warlords who have done better than we have. We'll roll the dice and see how this gambit plays out..."
generic_anything_we_can_dig_out: "Anything We Can Dig Out"
generic_anything_we_can_dig_out_desc: "In a world where everyone has the same goal as us, there's no point in trading with warlords who only want to conquer us! Therefore, we need to secure our future by mining as many resources as possible, looting all the scrap, garbage, and gathering other essential materials we need to create anything. The more we keep these resources with us, the more we will be able to produce, and thus we will be more prepared for any scenario that befalls us. Time to dig as much as we can, or the world will dig our grave!"
generic_semblances_of_economy: "Semblances of Economy"
generic_semblances_of_economy_desc: "The worst is behind us... We've built something that remotely resembles an economy. We're generating meager profits and extracting the energy, food, and raw materials we need. However, the future holds many more challenges for us to adapt to. Although this economy still leaves much to be desired, we are slowly on the right track to improving our situation. All we need to do is play our cards right and get to work. Patience and diligence never hurt."
generic_calm_before_the_storm: "Calm Before the Storm"
generic_calm_before_the_storm_desc: "We have everything ready, we're prepared for the worst; right now, there's a calm like the lull before a storm. Normally, it's better to enjoy the time and peace, but that's the downside of it. We need to be vigilant for every eventuality; without it, our fight could end before it starts. Enemies lurk all around everywhere, each with their own plans and devices, so we must have them too. Let's wait for the right moment to strike, and these small habits and preparations can determine our survival."
generic_heirs_of_the_nation: "Heirs of the Nation"
generic_heirs_of_the_nation_desc: "The time of reckoning has arrived at our gates! We must fight for our country as our ancestors did before us. We will fight to the end and until the victory is in our hands! We stand at the crossroads of our existence. Whether we want to survive or not, the fate of every citizen, their families, and their dreams depends on every single man! Ask not what our country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country! It is up to you, my fellow citizens, whether we will fulfill the dream of a better nation for ourselves and for future generations!"
generic_supply_caches: "Supply Caches"
generic_supply_caches_desc: "Supplies are an essential element of war. Without supplies, victory in war is impossible, even if our army were the most modern in the world. We should not repeat the mistakes of previous wars. Therefore, we must take care of our soldiers at such a critical time. We need supply points in our region to replenish the most essential supplies for soldiers: weapons, ammunition, fuel, and food. Since we still have functioning factories and willing workers, let's use them to aid us in this endeavor before it's too late!"
generic_strike_at_enemy_logistics: "Strike At Enemy Logistics"
generic_strike_at_enemy_logistics_desc: "Alright, boys, now it's time for some action straight out of Little Sabotage! Our enemies have vulnerable points that we must exploit to our advantage, so we need to sabotage every possible enemy strategic point - the more damage we inflict, the better! This land knows the ways of the partisans. There are numerous objects to sabotage, including supply points, railways, roads, and other vital structures. If we strike enough times, they might even fall to their knees. So, let's grab our pipe bombs, Molotov cocktails, and other tools and set out for victory!"
generic_cheap_drone_warfare: "Cheap Drone Warfare"
generic_cheap_drone_warfare_desc: "Drones have become a groundbreaking technology that changed the face of war, and despite the whinging of sceptics, drones are now very useful in modern warfare. Besides flying and observing beautiful landscapes or spying on neighbors, they can be used for infiltration, to peer into enemy camps, sabotage, or bombing raids. Even the cheapest, homemade drones from a garage can help us avoid ambushes and traps. Or set them. And besides, computer geeks and seasoned strategy gamers will finally have a real and important job... for the benefit of our country!"
generic_in_search_of_guns: "In Search of Guns"
generic_in_search_of_guns_desc: "Looking at our current scenario and condition, it has been deemed necessary to go and look for guns rather than put all efforts into mass production. We need as many guns as we can get. Even if it's only a short-term thing, if successful, it'll still lead to a quick and large surplus of weaponry. Another move we can take to get more of them will be sending some people to simply take guns from civilians. Although this may be a very risky move, the payoff doubles the risk at hand."
generic_tools_of_close_combat: "Tools of Close Combat"
generic_tools_of_close_combat_desc: "As warfare becomes more commonplace and a higher likelihood for our people, we must recognize that an arguably more important factor in said warfare than ranged combat is close combat. Our troops are currently mainly supplied with anything they can pick up, melee weaponry-wise. And because of this, the military is... less than satisfactory when it comes to close combat or hand-to-hand combat. With these ideas in mind, scavenging will begin, trying to get a single few melee weapons uniform for our whole military, and training our military in close-quarters combat."
generic_support_equipment_for_troops: "Support Equipment For Troops"
generic_support_equipment_for_troops_desc: "Our troops, no matter what, would crumble on their own without any support. We must supply our troops with ample support equipment to prevent said crumbling in any military engagement from happening. Even if it's something minor, we need support equipment to equip our soldiers within different specific corps, like engineering corps, recon corps and even certain combat corps like flamethrowers."
generic_seize_civilian_vehicles: "Seize Civilian Vehicles"
generic_seize_civilian_vehicles_desc: "Even though this may not be a popular move, we need to keep our state standing and surviving. We need cars for the military, whether for supply purposes or to commandeer for assault or defense purposes. Though we must keep a certain standard or quality regarding the vehicles we seize, as a Mini Cooper has no value to us at all, from its size to its strength. Even though this may limit the number of cars that are seized, standards need to be kept up and definitely met to preserve the lives and souls of the men who will be inside them, whether it be manning the guns or driving them."
generic_expanding_the_capital: "Expanding [ROOT.Capital.GetName]"
generic_expanding_the_capital_desc: "Ah, [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. Heart of our nation and home of our most treasured and prided institutions... it's also comparatively small and has been devastated by the consequences of the Fall. If we are to stand any chance at uniting the region, we must expand it so that we can be more sure of its security, productivity and defensability. After all, no measure is too great when it comes to protecting our leaders, the ones who love our people the most!"
generic_reconnecting_the_railways: "Reconnecting the Railways"
generic_reconnecting_the_railways_desc: "PKP railway systems have been utterly decimated. Rail has always (or, well, as long as it has existed) been an elementary facet of army logistics, and reconstructing our damaged infrastructure must be a priority! After all, an army marches on its stomach, and that stomach marches on a train full of recovered canned goods. And since a lot of them need to be repaired, we need to send the construction workers on every line to ensure that no train will suffer any unexpected damage. Plus, maybe restore some unused railroads. And then we ride."
generic_repairing_the_crucial_roads: "Repairing the Crucial Roads"
generic_repairing_the_crucial_roads_desc: "Highways and other roads across the whole country have likewise suffered a major hit during the war. If we want our armies to move around swiftly, we'll need to reconnect these crucial routes, or face the reality that was the everyday day of our ancestors, and figure out again why exactly roads were invented: because rolling a wheel or walking on a flat surface is much easier than on a surface that is, well, not flat. And let's not even start about getting anything through the muddy mess of the countryside roads."
generic_day_of_victory: "Day of Victory"
generic_day_of_victory_desc: "We have prepared as much as we can, fortified every corner, set up every attacking and defending force and outfitted them with support. Our logistics are... at least okay, our soldiers the same, and our support networks have been, to a limited extent, flourishing. It is now time: we must do what is necessary to bring order back to the region, OUR order! Let's march out and battle our enemies, brave soldiers!\nAnd hope that whatever happens, it will be in our favor."
generic_night_of_remembrance: "Night of Remembrance"
generic_night_of_remembrance_desc: "Thanks to the sacrifice of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ancestors throughout the history of our nation, we have always returned stronger than ever to take revenge on our enemies, even after the greatest defeats. That is why now, we have once again set out to sacrifice our lives in the name of a new, reborn state, which will carve the piece out of this cake. But we can't forget those who have given their lives for this dream to stay alive. Let the Night of Remembrance begin, a night for our heroes, the heroes of [ROOT.GetName]. As long as we live, so will they!"
generic_redefining_our_system: "Redefining Our System"
generic_redefining_our_system_desc: "We are finally in a position to freely chart our political direction. Since its founding, our movement has been built on a certain ideological promise. However, it is only easy to dream big when those dreams are far away. Now that we're firmly in charge, we have a lot of tough decisions to make. Can we afford to enforce all of our political ambitions, or will we have to resort to pragmatism? Will we tone down our rhetoric, or try to scale it up even further? Can the state we imagined even properly function? The choices we make now will forever define our system."
generic_begin_the_reforms: "Begin the Reforms"
generic_begin_the_reforms_desc: "It's high time to define our internal politics. Interest groups have been pushing hard to make us reaffirm our commitment to their most favored policies, while the people impatiently wait to see the implementation of our programs. We'll only have one chance to get this right. Backtracking is out of the question. Everybody's looking for results, and if we deviate from the expected course, we'll quickly lose all the credibility we've established so far. But perhaps, our situation may demand it."
generic_securing_our_industry: "Securing Our Industry"
generic_securing_our_industry_desc: "The economy is the foundation of every healthy state, which is why we must revive our industry, which has suffered greatly as a result of a long civil war. First and foremost, we will have to satisfy our internal needs, but rebuilding an industry that will be able to export abroad can help us gain international recognition. In view of all this, a new industrialisation project has been launched, involving dozens of projects and thousands of workers. This is the new industrial revolution that we will usher into these forgotten lands."

First we had the feudal fragmentation, then partitions, and now same shit again. But third time's the charm, right? I guess we should just do what we did before, and.. no, no, no, don't tell me it's not the same age, we have knights, and princes, and Russians, and Germans, it is THE same shit. So I guess just a bit history reading will do the trick, right? I'd really rather be reading history books now."
generic_expanding_the_administration: "Expanding the Administration"
generic_expanding_the_administration_desc: "A little known historical law is that every society will eventually collaborate when it comes to civilian administration. Poles seemed to lose their shit about it before the Fall. I guess they still do, especially in the West. But hey, once warm water stops flowing, sewers get clogged and bandits run around, they will beg for any civilian administration to turn up, and there will be someone convinced they can take the necessary sacrifice and make a deal with the devil. Following that principle, we will extend control over our whole territory."
generic_announce_the_elections: "Announce the Elections"
generic_announce_the_elections_desc: "An incredible advantage of democracy is that it allows us to shed resposibility. Technically, true democracy should not allow that, but are you really going to be picky in our situation? We have plenty responsibility to shed and share; just take a good look around this tree. As soon as we get some elections going, we'll find ourselves in a much more comfortable situation."

generic_an_unified_front: "An Unified Front"
generic_an_unified_front_desc: "Every political divide will sooner or later boil down to two competing factions, which will then become more and more similar, until they'll be only distinguished by particular interests of its members. What happens then? Someone could drop a nuclear bomb and start a multilateral civil war, but I doubt this will happen again. We should stop being afraid and embrace the United Front of Us against Them."
generic_future_of_our_regime: "Future of Our Regime"
generic_future_of_our_regime_desc: "The failure of Polish state was the failure of democracy as a whole. Precisely, the „liberal” democracy many are pontificating about as the pinnacle of European values. A once obtained power we shall never relinquish, at least not by a miserable election with 40% voter turnout. Whatever happens, we shall not sail into these murky waters again."

generic_shunning_the_oppostion_desc: "Does the opposition care what we think? Well, it doesn't. If it did, it would understand it's in the wrong and join us. They don't care. They just want us gone. Why should we care about them, then?"
generic_a_stern_leadership: "A Stern Leadership"
generic_a_stern_leadership_desc: "Any theory about Polish people's historical predisposition to democracy falls short when confronted with their obvious propensity for charismatic rulers. The lack of one uncontested leader led Poland to the political crisis and the Fall. It is obvious we have to step in the historical chain of great men to save Poland from vanishing once again."

generic_army_worthy_of_poland_desc: "So far we could get ahead by military organisation resembling football hooligans meetups, but at this stage of the run a functioning military is a necessity. We need to review what means avalaible to us, so we could choose the appropriate doctrine."
generic_private_healthcare: "Private Healthcare"
generic_private_healthcare_desc: "Whenever the government has a monopoly on healthcare, it creates an ineffective, bloated mess. At this point, years-long waiting lines have become a symbol. When there is no cost for treatment, people will waste doctors' time with the minutest of problems. Instead, we'll allow healthcare companies to compete for patients on the free market. Those that provide the best services will naturally win out, leaving us with a far more efficient system. One in which those with real medical concerns can always get the help they need, for the right price, of course."

Many of our citizens have found themselves in unfortunate circumstances, unable to support themselves or just barely scraping by. We can't turn around and ignore their suffering.

generic_1984_tbd_desc: "Media companies constantly lie, spinning made-up stories in an attempt to stay relevant. Journalists are outright poison, trying to trip up their interlocutors with underhanded tactics. Do we really want those kinds of people operating in our country? We have an important job to do, and the fewer pesky reporters shove their mics in our faces, the more effective we'd be at carrying out our agenda. Hostile narratives are harmful. To keep our citizens' minds free from propaganda, we'll gladly curate the information they need to receive. Nothing more."
generic_nfz_tbd: "Universal Healthcare Plan"

We won't allow greedy companies to stand over our ailing citizens and extort all their savings for a single medical procedure, all while some wealthy financier steps to the front of the line because he offered a higher price.

Some work to get to a better place in life, while others waste the chances they've been given and end up at the bottom of society. So, why would we reward failures with a helping hand? Why would we let the people know that it's okay not to try because the government will lift them up anyway? We do not need another generation of welfare-reliant slobs draining our budget. Those people are a lost cause anyway. The money would be better spent elsewhere."
generic_free_media_tbd: "Ensure the Freedom of Speech"
generic_free_media_tbd_desc: "While we strongly disagree with the opposition's coverage of our government, we will defend their right to freely attack and slander us. Media pluralism is often one of the main mechanisms preventing all-out dictatorial governance, and for the good of the country, we will submit ourselves to its whims. The rightful narrative that we represent in each of our policies will face the full weight of scrutiny, and it will come out of it even stronger. We don't need to propagandize to people to show them that we're correct."
generic_increase_the_emissions_tbd: "Increase Emissions"
generic_increase_the_emissions_tbd_desc: "There is a constant demand for cheap energy, so why would we limit our potential by adhering to some ridiculous emission guidelines? Last time we checked, the environment seems fine. The winters are cold, there is enough greenery around, and in some places, there's not even that much smog. Before anyone starts pointing fingers, even if we tried, we'd still produce just a tiny fraction of the global emissions, so how about they focus on that problem instead? We're just a relatively small nation trying to get by."
generic_advocate_energetic_transformation: "Advocate for an Energy Transition"
generic_advocate_energetic_transformation_desc: "We stand on the verge of an environmental catastrophe. Humanity has spent the past century destroying the only planet we've got, to the point where, unless we dramatically reduce our harmful impact, large swathes of it may soon end up uninhabitable. The struggle to save the environment is an international one, requiring all nations to do their part in reducing emissions, and we will gladly pitch in. Between shutting down smoke-spewing power plants, reducing coal usage, and promoting renewable sources, there is much we can do to help."
generic_fixing_our_power_grid: "Fixing Our Power Grid"
generic_fixing_our_power_grid_desc: "The collapse of the government apparatus and constant fighting have led to the complete destruction of the Polish power supply system, with power outages becoming an everyday occurrence. Destroyed transmission stations and burned-down power plants are just the beginning of our electrical system's problems. That is why the time has finally come to do something about it. Rebuilding the transmission lines will be a good start. It will be a big challenge, but not as big as rebuilding the dozens of power plants that supplied the Polish power system. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but the sooner we start, the sooner we will finish."
generic_black_gold: "Black Gold"
generic_black_gold_desc: "Coal. What more could one need than coal? The black gold has been mined in this country for hundreds of years, and that will likely continue for another thousand. Alternative energy sources are just too expensive for what we can currently manage. Instead, we'll just pick up our pickaxes and start smashing them at the nearest promising rock like in the good old days. If it was good enough then, it's bound to be good enough now. Coal will never fail you. It's not like this stuff can ever run out, right?"
generic_prospecting_for_resources: "Prospecting for Resources"
generic_prospecting_for_resources_desc: "We can no longer endure serious shortages of raw materials! The time has come to make use of our capabilities and open new sources of strategic resources.\nSoon, our industry will be able to fully realize its potential, thanks to national resources. New deposits are nourishment for development. We will provide our workers with modern infrastructure, equipment, and technologies. We can also expect a true surge in production as soon as the new resources feed our factories!\nYou praise what is foreign, yet do not know your own!"
generic_coal_oil_and_gas: "Coal, Oil and Gas"
generic_coal_oil_and_gas_desc: "Yes indeed! Our new motto should be: 'coal, oil, and gas'!\nLet us not pretend that modern, 'ecological' inventions will provide us with either sufficient energy or the necessary fuel.\nCoal, oil, and gas are our future, as well as our chance for a prosperous economy. We must build as many well-known and proven coal power plants as possible. Ensuring fuel and energy will not be a problem if we rely on the familiar sources of traditional raw materials.\nCoal, oil, gas! "
generic_go_green: "Go Green!"
generic_go_green_desc: "Invest in the future! Invest in green energy!\nEcological and renewable energy sources appear to be the most reasonable, long-term solution. Wind, solar power, water, biomass, thermal heat - these will drive our development! What is important is that these sources are renewable, which means we do not need to worry about their depletion. Unlike their alternatives, they do not pollute the environment, which our residents will surely appreciate.\nThis project will undoubtedly modernize both our technological and construction bases."
generic_increasing_our_imports: "Increasing Our Imports"
generic_increasing_our_imports_desc: "Unfortunately, shortages of raw materials in certain regions may effectively hinder our production. We will not fully develop our potential without the proper resource base. That is why we should not rely only on our native sources.\nHowever, our deficit can be resolved by increasing the import of the necessary materials.\nLet us open ourselves to other markets!\nWe will surely be able to generate profit and sign favorable trade treaties. This will strengthen our international position and this is an opportunity to build our brand and recognition abroad! "
generic_alternative_fuel_sources: "Alternative Fuel Sources"
generic_alternative_fuel_sources_desc: "Conventional fuels are now outdated. Their sources are becoming increasingly depleted, and using them results in harm to the environment.\nA new era of alternative fuels is approaching!\nStarting with the already well-known biogas, we can also point to less familiar options. Who would have thought that, for example, used cooking fat can be turned into 'biodiesel' fuel? And there are even more such sources: ammonia, methanol, hydrogen... all of these can serve us, as long as we are willing to embrace new solutions! "
generic_gifts_of_our_earth: "Gifts of Our Earth"
generic_gifts_of_our_earth_desc: "Regardless of our worldview or other prospects: Not only do our armies march on their stomachs, so does our entire society. This earth, marred by civilization and decivilization alike, can still grow crops, and we must choose a guiding philosophy in raising these crops. On top of those, the nation is trashed: Alongside farming, we will formalize making the trash around us our treasures."
generic_radical_gardening: "Radical Gardening"
generic_radical_gardening_desc: "RADICAL GARDENING UP! UP! UP!\nWe cannot afford to stick to 'sustainable', 'organic' farming. The stresses of survival and warfare demand maximum yield in short time. Fertilizers with dubious shelf life, our dead, totally safe chemicals we cook ourselves: Everything must serve to increase yield. Any disease tied to excessive fertilization can be pinned on the stress of post-Fall life anyways."
generic_scrap_tbd: "Focus on Scavenging"
generic_scrap_tbd_desc: "All around us, there is decrepit, rusting steel. Scrap. Ruins. Wreckage. Things we can use. Give them new life. There is pure, shining steel beneath all of this junk. We just have to scavenge these rotting steel bones and resmelt them, purging the rust and beholding the metal given new strength. One rusted beam at a time, this will give us enough boost to get our economy on its legs."
generic_gigafarms_tbd: "Giant Farming Complexes"
generic_gigafarms_tbd_desc: "Call it what you want: Latifundia, agribusiness, factory farming. The concept is simple: Take mom-and-pop neo-manoral patches of land and consolidate them into industrial-age systems of infrastructure that make most of economy of scale. From a hundreds of homesteads, one complex, with triple the yield of the small farms it devoured and one fourth the personnel involved. This is our future."
generic_natural_gardening: "Natural Gardening"
generic_natural_gardening_desc: "We are beset on all sides by ailing healthcare and manifold threats to our health: we don't need our food to sicken us as well. Our farms will therefore be strictly organic. We need not sift through artificial fertilizers when we have perfectly fine cattle dung to enhance our soil! Our people will thank us for less, but healthier produce, and so will our soldiers."
generic_focus_on_recycling: "Focus on Recycling"
generic_focus_on_recycling_desc: "The post-Fall Poland is a treasure trove of once useless junk. It is a cornicupia of parts, materials and everything else inbetween. On top of that, nearly every settlement has a hobo populace that spent years utilizing trash. Leverage their wisdom, and recycle the nation's rotten remains into our new future. The refurbished goods can be then reused for civilian and industrial use with a fraction of energy that'd be spent manufacturing new goods."
generic_ecological_farming_initiatives: "Ecological Farming Initiatives"
generic_ecological_farming_initiatives_desc: "Eco-friendly farming is a science and art all of its own, worthy of dedicating intellectuals to further develop. Having rejected unnatural and artificial agribusiness, we can now work on optimizing small, natural farms even further: soil research, fertilization practices, crop rotations, with eye on sustainability and health of all involved. Because of decreased ecological footprint, we can pride ourselves in quality, sought-after produce, while concentrating our farms even further without breaking the ecosystem's back. Most importantly, we prove that healthy food is more than viable at scale."
generic_there_used_to_be_a_factory: "There Used to be a Factory..."
generic_there_used_to_be_a_factory_desc: "Before the Fall, Poland used to have a somewhat substantial industrial base, one that seems almost incomprehensibly efficient compared to the little workshops we currently rely on. Much of that former industry was left abandoned, but the factories still stand to this day, their empty production halls just waiting for someone to restore them to an operational state. Now that our immediate matters have been dealt with, it's time to relocate our manufacturing sector into these behemoths. We'll make sure they're used to their fullest capacity."
generic_thousand_people_had_money_bread: "...A Thousand People Had Money for Bread"
generic_thousand_people_had_money_bread_desc: "Our industrial renewal isn't just about the raw manufacturing output. Ultimately, what we do serves the people. Many of the factories we're seeking to reopen used to be the main employment opportunity for their local communities. We've more than enough willing hands itching to get back to work. Who are we to say no? If they want to put bread on their families' plates, they can even produce it themselves, as well as enough for their whole neighborhood while they're at it."
generic_fire_blazed_from_the_furnaces: "...Fire Blazed from the Furnaces"
generic_fire_blazed_from_the_furnaces_desc: "Nothing beats the glorious sight of heavy industry. The blazing furnaces, the seamlessly moving assembly lines, the endless churning of machinery... ask any worker and he'll tell you the factory moves in its own beautiful rhythm. These lot know theirs moves for a greater cause. We'll need tons of heavy equipment and armor if we're to make any further plays in Poland. The more of it we stockpile, the closer we'll get to actually being considered a serious contender."
generic_for_three_shifts: "...For Three Shifts..."
generic_for_three_shifts_desc: "In our current position, we cannot afford moderation. Our workforce is already stretched thin, struggling to keep up with the constant demand for manufactured goods. We need to work hard for the greater good. If a double, or even triple shift is what makes the difference between our victory and defeat, we must put all concerns aside and keep our people in the factories, even beyond standard working hours. They will be properly compensated when the situation allows it. For now... it regrettably doesn't."
generic_a_normal_thing: "...A Normal Thing"
generic_a_normal_thing_desc: "There was a time when we looked at Poland's fallen industry with a sense of humble respect. It showed us just how backward our measly statelet used to be. Since then, we have incorporated the country's manufacturing potential and made it our own. In some sectors, we have even begun to expand upon it, exceeding the pre-Fall output. In doing so, we have put our names on the regional stage. We've built the foundations of a modern, efficient industry, but we cannot stop there. One thing is certain - this is only the beginning."
generic_civilian_investments: "Civilian Investments"
generic_civilian_investments_desc: "The state's primary function is to provide for its citizens. Health, education, safety... we may disagree amongst ourselves as to just how many aspects of daily life we should interfere in, but there is internal agreement that we should at least do something. A small portion of our budget could be diverted to supply the people with the most basic necessities and lay the groundwork for crucial services. Later, we'll be able to build upon it and determine the primary direction of our investments."
generic_building_new_hospitals: "Building New Hospitals"
generic_building_new_hospitals_desc: "It's unbecoming of a proper state to have people dying en masse on the streets because they couldn't be provided with even the most basic of medical care. Hospitals are costly projects, but you can't put a price tag on our people's well-being. We have no hope of being able to afford cutting-edge equipment or attracting world-renowned specialists, yet the people should appreciate the opportunity to address all their medical issues, especially now that there is no longer a several-year-long waiting list to see most doctors."
generic_reopening_the_universities: "Reopening the Universities"
generic_reopening_the_universities_desc: "While an uneducated populace may be relatively easy to rule over, we won't be able to maintain a modern economy when most of our citizens are unsuited for anything beyond manual labor. Providing easy access to institutions of higher learning will earn us the support of the youngest generations, yearning for new opportunities in our fledgling nation. In just a few short years, we can expect a massive return on our investment in the form of hundreds of expertly educated graduates, armed with the knowledge of just exactly why our system is what works best in their fields."
generic_expanding_the_temples: "Expanding the Temples"
generic_expanding_the_temples_desc: "Worship is an important part of a person's life. Our citizens deserve an opportunity to commune with the divine, or else they will quickly become disheartened and lose their sense of purpose - at least that's what the more religiously attuned among us have been repeatedly warning us of. If that is what they need, so be it. There is no harm in providing our people with an appropriate space to express their faith. Besides, there is no better way to control religious institutions than to serve as their primary sponsor."
generic_construct_new_prisons: "Construct New Prisons"
generic_construct_new_prisons_desc: "In our country, we have far too many... let's just call them 'undesirables'. Criminals, spies, proponents of problematic ideologies... if only there were some way to contain them all in a heavily-monitored, enclosed space from which they would be unable to continue their harmful actions. Luckily, there's a simple solution - more prisons. All it takes is a sufficiently remote location, heaps of hard, gray concrete, and an unbribable set of guards for us to forget about those pesky troublemakers."
generic_improving_our_technological_base: "Improving Our Technological Base"
generic_improving_our_technological_base_desc: "We can't always be a technological backwater, copying innovations that Western Europe already made 20 years ago. Eventually, our goal is to catch up, and if we are to achieve that, we'll have to think ahead and develop our own R&D projects. Of course, whatever funding we scrounge up won't allow us to compete with more established facilities, but getting our people used to the idea that we can conduct independent research without having to rely on others will hopefully make a dent in their backward mindsets."
generic_money_is_the_new_god: "Money is the New God"
generic_money_is_the_new_god_desc: "We need money, and we need it fast. Yes, yes, development is important. Investments and all that. But we NEED money. All that 'economy' stuff is too hard anyway. Why can't we just take all the stuff that people own and take it for ourselves? We've already given them so much. They can figure out all the complicated financial stuff, and we'll wait with a big money bag and grab whatever they earn. Honestly, why didn't we think of this sooner? This is genuinely the easiest, most non-problematic solution ever created."
generic_managing_our_budget: "Managing Our Budget"
generic_managing_our_budget_desc: "Whatever funds we earn are essentially meaningless unless we learn to balance our books. At our current economic level, even a single mismanaged investment could be enough to potentially send us into a never-ending debt spiral, which would force us to progressively sell all our assets until we're essentially left with nothing. It's a tedious, frustrating job to keep track of every single government expense, but the promise of financial independence is more than worth the effort."
generic_invisible_hand_of_the_market: "Invisible Hand of the Market"
generic_invisible_hand_of_the_market_desc: "Markets do best when left to develop mostly on their own. Government intervention has a worrying tendency to stifle economic growth, especially now, when there are so many moving parts that some distant bureaucrat would have no hope of competing against free market forces. Instead, management should be left to the experts - private investors who have both the know-how and the profit motive required to outperform their competitors and generate the necessary revenue."
generic_lower_taxes: "Lower Taxes"
generic_lower_taxes_desc: "There is truth to the statement that taxation is a form of theft. What right do we have to take money from the hands of hardworking citizens, or at least, to take as much as we currently do? And why would they go the extra mile, try their best, come up with innovative methods to increase production or work overtime, when in the end, the government is going to leave them with almost no compensation? We need entrepreneurs, not mindless cogs looking to put in the minimal effort required to earn a paycheck. Allowing risk-takers to retain a larger portion of their returns will provide a further incentive to invest."
generic_freeing_our_markets: "Freeing Our Markets"
generic_freeing_our_markets_desc: "Like it or not, the modern world has globalized, and autarky is no longer a viable solution. Economies become more effective with scale, while those who refuse to engage in the global market are left with inefficient manufacturing systems and frequent shortages. Simply, they will quickly find themselves outcompeted. We can't possibly hope to find everything we need within our borders. Instead, we should become a link in the global supply chain - sell our surpluses to the highest bidder and import that which we cannot produce ourselves from abroad."
generic_visible_fist_of_the_goverment: "Visible Fist of the Government"
generic_visible_fist_of_the_goverment_desc: "Private investors are a spineless, ignorant bunch. While some stumble upon success at the cost of the scorched earth they leave behind, most ventures eventually fail and must be bailed out by the most responsible financial institution there is: the government. State capital management may not be as flashy, but it's a guarantee of slow, steady growth. For almost everyone involved, it's better to have a stable monopoly providing equal access to its services than dozens of small companies using underhanded tactics to carve up a piece of the market."
generic_higher_taxes: "Higher Taxes"
generic_higher_taxes_desc: "Money doesn't grow on trees. Government programs aren't cheap, and neither is the military. The problem is - we need both, and more. Unless we plan to overclock the money printers, we need to get the necessary funds from somewhere. Considering how much we already do for our citizens, it's only fair that we repurpose an additional portion of their wealth to expand our operations. It's all for their good anyway. They can thank us later."
generic_regulating_our_trade: "Regulating Our Trade"
generic_regulating_our_trade_desc: "Foreign nations rarely have our best interests at heart, and the same is true when it comes to trade. Given a chance, they'd siphon off our best products and flood our markets with cheap, worthless goods. Many people would lose their jobs, manufacturing would likely take a major hit, we would become dependent on unreliable imports... It's our imperative to prevent that from happening. We'll close ourselves off from the world if we must, but we will not be pawns in someone else's game."
generic_the_future_of_warfare: "The Future of Warfare"

generic_ghost_divisions: "Ghost Divisions"
generic_ghost_divisions_desc: "This focus should sound like Kapitan Bomba soundtrack - Z Przyczajki. We should play this piece to perspective recruits to let them get into spirit.

generic_mechanized_war: "Mechanized War"
generic_mechanized_war_desc: "While the Fall opened a ton of possibilities for utilising other means for mobility, we should not think these are permanent developments in military technology. Total mechanisation of our armed forces should be a necessity. We failed with this once in 1939."

We need better strategic cooperation between different sectors. The ones travelling by car should be able to quickly change their means of transport to plane, train, or boat if it's possible. There needs to be one central hub to coordinate this traffic. To do so, we will revisit the idea of the Central Communication Port that the pre-Fall government of Law and Justice began to built. Of course, our new project will be modified to better suit our current situation."

Unfortunately, the mend was brought about by levelling down and closing more and more train stations. Now, we, in the face of the growing need for mobility and reindustrialization, have to restore the trains to their rightful place in our economy. The numbers are clear - it's the most efficient and cheapest method of transportation for both our industry and our citizens, unable to move from small villages to larger cities without a car.\nThe tracks are the future!"

As of now, there are only Zawiercie-Grodzisk Mazowiecki and Warsaw-Gdańsk connections. Not to mention their usual speed for personal transport, which is capped at 200 km/h due to previously lacking infrastructure. As you can see, there's much to be done. Thankfully, we've already upgraded our railway network. All that remains is to import and build ourselves the appropriate models to provide rapid transport for our citizens and industry.\nIt's a natural next step in our reforms, further boosting the advantages the regular trains provide."

The news of a civil war in a central European country attracted the attention of the whole world.

When the perfidious Germans stifled our trade through Gdansk, we've built a whole new city next to it despite everything. After the communism collapsed, our recovery stood head and shoulders over that of our neighbors. It is thus no surprise that today, our economy shines above expectations.

It might be less than comfortable for our elderly, it might bear uncanny semblance to some of the chapters of Revelations, but a cashless banking system closes many key loopholes for criminal use and tax evasion.

From civil servant's end, more and more factors of governance become digitized: Data normally tediously inferred and gathered, now travel seamlessly to the official's desk, and course corrections are made on the fly.

We need a large, recognizable central government building that will gather all the most important political officials for deliberation. Thankfully, we control a completely serviceable Sejm and Senate Complex ready to be renovated. We may even modify the design to better represent the roots of our ideology. Restoring the ancient seat of Polish government will greatly legitimise our government in the eyes of our citizens as well as foreign officials. This one central organ will also make lawmaking much easier by gathering dispersed politicians in one place.

The peacekeeping forces, as well as special services, do a great job of rooting out dangerous dissidents, but there is only so much that so few can do. We need to encourage civilians to help us as well. We will print new propaganda posters, start a campaign on TVs, and on the Internet. All of that to encourage people to become unofficial collaborators who will be adequately rewarded for the information they provide about the protesters and schemers. All for the good of the public security, of course. We'll also outline which activities are marks of suspicious activities and which phrases are dog-whistles of terrorists to keep our population on their toes."

Our state is young, and it will take time for those guides to take root in people's souls. Nevertheless, the most adaptive members of our society have already accepted the new order and are a beacon of success and fulfilment to those unconvinced or misguided. They prove we are right and the path to welfare is clear and easily approachable. You just have to play on our terms.

We need something grander, something with greater artistic value. Something that will completely encapsulate what we fight for and what we want to implement. It will take the breath of all who see it, as it will tower over our capital, sending a signal to the world that we're coming. The construction will take some time, but the effort will be worth it.

It seemed impossible at first, back when we were just a tiny, dysfunctional statelet, but through the brilliance of our leaders, the heroism of our soldiers, and the grit of our citizens, we have managed to unify the entirety of Poland. Before, we lived in the quiet shadow of what this nation once was. Now, we are free to shape it in accordance with our vision, and there is nobody left who can stop us from achieving it. This day marks the dawn of a new era. Our era."

The new national holiday will fall on the day of the unification and will be celebrated with all the necessary pomp, recounting our journey, struggles, fallen enemies, and the ultimate triumph against all the odds. No budget will be spared.

We are now able to enact sweeping reforms with the single stroke of a pen. There has never been a better time to enforce our ideological program on the entire population. Our ministers have prepared a set of statutes that will appropriately reflect our long-held ambitions.

We are a proud country ready to engage with other countries as equals. For years, our neighbours were watching curiously how the situation on the Vistula was developing. Some were quietly supporting us, others wanted us to defeat something they considered the greater evil, and there were those who ideally would want nothing to do with us, given the alternative. But there's no alternative. We became a wealthy partner in the region, and there are no other pretenders to contest that.

After a generation or so, we will achieve cultural hegemony; Our ideals will infuse themselves into the hearts and minds of the people permanently. Magnificent buildings, even greater than those we already built, will be commenced not because our revenue has grown from Odra to Bug.

And once this tsunami of our might breaches their lines, there will be a lot of slow singing and flower bringing. To that end, we train and devise new ways to make the most of our manpower.

Whether that's a myth or not, it won't materialize here: We have devised a weapon to surpass the fanciest war beasts the USA has to offer not through superior firepower, but superior quantity and reliability. It will not jam, it will not break, it will be made at scale using the tools we have. Our own answer to the AK-47, made for today.

On defence, or oftentimes attack, an army with better training, leadership and equipment, wins out. We will be one of those armies: with better soldier and better guns than anyone else.

Modern equipment combined with proper tactics is enough to completely crush enemy logistics or destroy fortified positions.\nAdditionally, it will be useful to upgrade all types of artillery for combating armored and aerial targets.

Having fought and known all about post-Fall battlefields, the best instructors and staffers from us can only be us. We will educate and promote officers and instructors from the most merited among our own forces.

It becomes increasingly vital to rule its waves, and so it becomes vital to have an organized albeit hardly prioritized navy. We may be limited to repurposed cargo ships and river tugs, but they too require expertise to command, and that's where our naval acedemy will come in."

In the past, prides of the European armadas made all the headlines and turned attention of crowds, displaying greatness of their states. While Vistula, let alone smaller bodies of water, might limit displacement unless we have a seaport, any grand enough ship will revitalize the nation, and show that we still can do grand things. Focusing on larger ships will thus provide us with ways of influencing battles unavaialble to mere fishing boats."

Its unparalleled mobility and ability to deliver accurate firepower makes it a necessary support arm, and amazing motivator for the other side to divert resources to countermeasures. Aviation is also an engineering-heavy branch, requiring unnumbered experts and mechanics behind every bird and its knightly pilot. Before you can have meaningful airforce, you need an academy to train all these experts."

In modern warfare, under modern engineering, survivability is everything, as Americans prove to us time and time again. We must prove our mettle in creating indestructible tanks by making something truly monstrous. It needs more bullets, bigger weapons, and passive defence that will let it shrug off anything short of a nuke. Active too, if we have any.

We will revive the ancient hero archetype, a man with ego almost matching his strength and courage, reflexes better than machine's, endurance better than a beast's. How do we get there? Physio-pharmaceutical experiments, perfect specimens, and willingness to see some prespective supersoldiers falter. This is how heroes are made.

Likewise, we will create our own legions of the best soldiers, handpicked from the rest, trained to perfection, and equipped with the best gear we can muster. These elite units will be our spearhead, our hammer, and our shield. They will make impossible possible, and render arithmetics of mass irrelevant, just like winged hussars of old shattered Tatars and Muscovites alike."

It sheltered them from the eyes of the oppressors, let them strike and vanish, and provided them with resources to survive. To fight them, we must master the forest ourselves. We will train our soldiers in forest warfare, equip them with camouflage and survival gear, and teach them to move silently and strike hard. With this, we will turn the forest from a partisan's ally to our own. We will protect the woods as they protect us, our nation's one natural barrier worth anything."

generic_protectors_from_the_skies_desc: "It takes a certain daredevil spirit to walk into a plane with parachute and jump off of it in air. Those who made it so far would end up in the middle of the enemy lines, on trains, sometimes with lost equipment. If they're lucky, they assemble and strike where it hurts the most. More than worth it. We must have a ready cohort of such knights, trained to jump behind enemy lines, sabotage their logistics, and emulate heroes of World War 2 Airborne."

Now we cannot imagine war without trucks, armored vehicles and more, nor should we. As such, our vehicles must be perfectly fit for the purpose of reunifying the nation: Rugged, efficient and able to get over a ruin or two. But first we must decide just how heavy must our vehicles be: Behemots, or agile and redundant cats of prey."
generic_quick_and_agile: "Quick and Agile"
generic_quick_and_agile_desc: "Large, heavily armored units are expensive, difficult to maintain, and overall overrated. Shunning them completely would be unwise, of course, but we shouldn't set them on a pedestal. Especially given our current industrial capabilities. Instead, we should focus on making our vehicles more. That way, we'd be able to achieve greater adaptability in the changing battlefield environment and reach enemies' strategic positions much faster. By focusing on agility, we may even be able to get by having less firepower; Our machines will be able to outmanoeuvre more heavily armored vehicles and strike at their weak spots."
generic_a_new_armored_car: "A New Armored Car"
generic_a_new_armored_car_desc: "While they are deadly against infantry and other soft-skinned targets, armored cars are eyes on the ground. They are easy to build and maintain, extremely fast, and invaluable during reconnaissance, internal security, armed escort, and other subordinate battlefield tasks. While they are equipped with a machine gun, it is mainly used for self-defense. Another disadvantage they have is wheels that are less capable off-road, as well as easier to damage by enemy fire. They have their niche, however; They perform rather well in tight urban environments, and we can't allow ourselves to neglect them."
generic_modern_apc: "Modern APCs"
generic_modern_apc_desc: "Thanks to armored cars, we know where to go; now we have to focus on how we get to the goal. And with whom. That's why we need to take a closer look at our APCs. The main aim will be to quickly transport soldiers, who will do most of the fighting. They may not be as glamorous as the big cannon on tracks, but they're still highly useful. The infantry, no matter the technological advancement, is still irreplaceable in its adaptability. Packing them in APCs solves the question of their lack of mobility, which is one of this formation's major disadvantages."

generic_heavy_and_powerful_desc: "We seek to show our dominance on the battlefield. The Polish military theatre is severely lacking in terms of heavily armored vehicles, artillery, or even anti-tank weapons. By focusing on the protection, we can ensure that our enemies, mostly lightly armored partisans, will be unable to oppose us.\nWe will modify our alloys to make them even more resilient and outfit our vehicles with thicker armor. Of course, they will be much less manoeuvrable, but let's be honest. They'll have nothing to run from."
generic_another_version_of_bmp: "Another Version of BMP"
generic_another_version_of_bmp_desc: "The old, based on soviet design of BMPs (also known as BWPs), were beloved by the hardliners in the pre-Fall Polish military. Basic amphibious capacity was enough for them to stare in awe. Maybe that's why Poland collapsed.\nWe can't allow ourselves to rely on underperforming, antique designs, but we won't reinvent the wheel. We still need versatile IFVs on the battlefield, and a new generation of these vehicles will be heavily based on the BMPs of the past, but will be significantly more advanced, almost beyond recognition to the layman's eye."

generic_king_of_the_battlefield_desc: "In the wild realities of the Fall, many of our military theorists expect that our impoverished enemies will try to flood us with cheap and agile armored cars and IFVs as they can't afford to construct something more substantial. Our country, on the other hand, has a well-developed industry to build and professional personnel to maintain large quantities of Main Battle Tanks. Those steel behemoths will squash the meager enemy vehicles like insects!\nOf course, the MBTs have their limits. They fare rather badly in large urban centers and need an infantry's support there. And our ambitious program will noticeably stretch our budget. Still, in the open field we will be unmatched."

For years, truckers, the pride of Polish highways, traversed Europe bringing pride to the economy of the Third Republic and woe to foreign, especially German, truckers. Now their modes of transportation are gathering dust in garages as the roads have become more dangerous or are completely abandoned. Either way, we can reappropriate them for our benefit. We need them for the cheap transportation of soldiers and provisions for armies. As time goes by, we'll start producing our own models designed especially for military use."

generic_modern_spg_designs_desc: "Self-Propelled Guns offer the precision and power comparable to towed artillery, combined with significantly higher mobility. Their armor serves as protection for the crew using it. Unfortunately, it's also more expensive. Still, it's also more agile, so as long as the crew keeps moving it after shooting, they should be alright and not waste our budget. The towed artillery might be more important in here and now, but we have to think ahead. Our enemies won't even know what hit them."

Having the same defensive and mobile capabilities, they rain on the enemies with a hailstorm of missiles. While they're good for clearing the enemy lines, it's better not to use them to support friendly troops in the field. Their fire doesn't discriminate. We can somewhat prevent that by upgrading the targeting system, but don't get your hopes up too high."

We've done our homework, set up a proper base, and hired sailors. Soon, our state will wed the water that surrounds us. The enemies will tremble as the roar of ship cannons covers the invasion force, striking them at their underbellies. Our traders will be able to swim safely to their destination thanks to our protection of the blue highways. And if they try the same tactics on us? They'll have to get through a wall of mines.\nThe waves will belong to us."

generic_rule_the_waves: "[ROOT.GetName] Rules the Waves!"
generic_rule_the_waves_desc: "To fully reach naval supremacy, we must boost our abilities of coordinating and dealing more damage to the enemy. Making our ships faster and more coordinated will allow us to strike first and strike hard, crippling the enemy before they can even react. Additionally, we must invest in damage control systems that will allow our ships to stay afloat longer and fight harder, even when under heavy fire. By focusing on these areas, we can ensure that our navy is a force to be reckoned with, capable of dominating the seas and protecting our nation's interests."

We must invest in advanced reconnaissance technology to ensure we have the most up-to-date information on enemy positions and activities. This will allow us to make informed decisions and respond quickly to any potential threats from enemies standing in our way for greatness."
generic_rule_the_skies: "[ROOT.GetName] Rules the Skies!"
generic_rule_the_skies_desc: "With war peaking around the corner, we must make sure our air force is ready for battle. Preparation is essential, and we cannot afford to leave anything to chance. We should focus on advancing our superiority in the skies by investing in cutting-edge aircraft, rigorous pilot training, and advanced tactics that will give us an edge over any adversary. At the same time, it is equally important to raise our people's morale, fostering unity and confidence in our nations capabilities. Through public demonstrations of our air power and clear communication of our strategic goals, we can inspire both our troops and civilians. Only then will we stand prepared for whatever challenges the future may bring."
generic_ground_support_focus: "Ground Support Focus"
generic_ground_support_focus_desc: "What is an air force without the ability to assist our troops on land? The true strength of our aerial forces lies not just in the skies but in their capacity to directly influence the outcome of ground engagements. We need to prioritize supporting the battles fought on the ground by providing timely and precise air support to our soldiers. By investing in training and fostering close coordination between air and land units, we can ensure that our planes become a decisive factor in determining the outcome of conflicts. If we begin this effort now, it will only be a matter of time before our aircraft start changing the course of land battles and tipping the scales in our favor."
generic_bombo_tbd: "Develop New Bombers"
generic_bombo_tbd_desc: "We have been left behind by other countries, which are already using bombers for their military actions and gaining valuable experience in modern warfare. This technological gap puts us at a significant disadvantage and threatens our ability to defend our interests effectively. Only by investing in research, gaining operational experience, and developing newer, more advanced models can we hope to catch up. By doing so, we can eventually start using bombers as one of our main tools for battle, projecting power across vast distances and ensuring our military remains competitive on the world stage."

By integrating CAS into our military operations, we can provide critical support to ground troops, disrupt enemy movements, and soften fortified positions ahead of an advance. The CAS will help our troops storm through any enemies defence and win any battle, turning the tide in our favor even against formidable adversaries."
generic_drones_tbd: "Unmanned Swarm"
generic_drones_tbd_desc: "Drones have become increasingly relevant in modern warfare because they do not require a pilot onboard, greatly reducing the risk to our personnel. We must take advantage of this technological advancement and invest in developing a powerful swarm of drones, capable of carrying out coordinated attacks with precision and efficiency. By deploying large numbers of drones, we can overwhelm and disrupt enemy defense lines, gather real-time intelligence, and strike strategic targets without exposing our own forces to danger.

# FOCUS DESCRIPTIONS #

#First descriptions
generic_firstDESC_marxism_cranism_ideology_key: "Finally, a truly popular government is formed! There are voices amongst the party members that this would mean it's time for an immediate democratisation, but we can't have that. Years of capitalist propaganda seeped into the minds of the working class, polluting it. Bourgeois notions of democracy will do us no good. Henceforth, we'll need to strictly oversee the democratic process. The candidates to the supreme council will have to be members of the party, and their mandate must be retractable if it diverges from the party line. With those precautions, we'll be sure that we'll have the ideologically pure vanguard directing the masses towards the bright future. People trust that we represent their interests and have offered us their trust!"
generic_firstDESC_squattism_ideology_key: "We bring liberation from tyranny from all sides of the political spectrum. Our people enjoy freedom from capitalist exploitation, reactionary politics of brown fascists, or the cruelty of red fascists. That is why we are the ire in the eyes of most of our neighbours. They view our lands as unclaimed by a polity they would deem to be 'legitimate', reading themselves to pacify our revolution. But those who tasted freedom are unwilling to give it back. They pick up weapons and enlist in recruitment centers, ready for the confrontation with the enemy forces.\nLong live Anarchy!"
generic_firstDESC_socialdemocrature_ideology_key: "The left has always been accepting of minorities who wanted to flee persecution. The people of different skin colors, the sexual minorities, and the opposition members from dictatorships have always been welcomed by the social democrats. It is even more important that we keep this approach, as Poland is tormented by the radical warlords who persecute anyone who dares to question their ideologies. It is our moral imperative to provide them with asylum until they get better. We hope many of them will recognize the wisdom of our politics and choose to stay within our borders to work with us for a better future."
generic_firstDESC_euroliberalism_ideology_key: "Europe has always been a standard for us, a shining paragon of political behavior. No matter what some may say, cooperation with European countries is a key to our security against potential invasion from Russia or other warlords and a guarantee of maintaining democratic standards. They are one of our most valuable trading partners, whose economic and military help will be invaluable when unifying Poland. We hope that when this whole ordeal is over, we will be welcomed as a full member of the Union, where, as a member of Western Civilization, we belong."
generic_firstDESC_freemarketism_ideology_key: "Our plan is for everyone to live a life of luxury they deserve. Everyone will be able to forge their own destiny. We'll be a land of the truly free. Every individual will be free to fulfill their desires to enrich themselves and, by extension, society as a whole. Every family will enjoy the possession of a house with a garden, two cars, while still being able to go on holidays. Of course, this way of life dedicated to consumption will create all sorts of trouble, such as a shorter workday and an increase in the occurrence of diseases of affluence. Still, this policy is highly popular among the people."
generic_firstDESC_paternal_conservatism_ideology_key: "Few simple words: Truth, faith, zeal, beauty, work, sacrifice. For generations, those were the ideals that shaped our society. They were the bedrock upon which our great civilization was built. Straying away from them, what caused the Fall and the strife that followed resulted in the continued decline in popularity of this maxim. It is our duty to guide our population away from nihilism back to basics, so that our nation will rise again. To show them there are still immortal and everlasting values worth fighting for. We will shine in an example that will mobilize our soldiers to fight for honor and fatherland, and encourage the civilians to work for the common good."
generic_firstDESC_autocracy_ideology_key: "The old society has collapsed. People are fed up with the constant bickering of bureaucrats and politicians. They seek a one capable leader, who will deliver them to safety and power, and [ROOT.GetLeader] is ready to answer their call. [ROOT.GetLeader] is ready to give people what they want. One decisive leader is what the nation needs if effective and quick actions are to be taken in a changing environment. Some of our citizens support this type of strong-arm politician, some, more sceptical, are placated with the promise of democratization once the time of troubles passes. But even dissidents will come to see our way, once they see the results we provide. After all, they just need to look out the window to see the fate of democracies."
generic_firstDESC_corporativism_ideology_key: "The flow of money is the fuel of the economic engine. Sometimes the cash flows to us, sometimes we have to send it to someone else. We may have a monopolistic position in most of the sectors of the economy, but we still have to rely on the regionally elected politicians for governing at the lowest level. We basically outsource the usual specializations of the state, such as conscription and bureaucracy, to them. The tricky thing is that some of them are not as willing to cooperate with us as others. Thankfully, we can finance the campaigns of the honest candidates, whose policies conveniently align with our aims. All with the proper regard to the rule of law."
generic_firstDESC_neonationalism_ideology_key: "We are the true representatives of the people. Our ideology encapsulates the very soul of the nations. We follow the ideas that made us strong in the past, and that can make us strong in the future. We will promote the ideals of servitude to the national interest by following the principles of honest work for the community. We simultaneously reject the notions of international help. In these daring times, we need to fend for our people first and foremost, even to the detriment of other groups. We will strike at the forces that threaten us with a unified strike of a million fists."
generic_firstDESC_reactionary_ideology_key: "The previous system did what it could to sever the ties between us and our past and traditions. Right now, people are misguided and disoriented as they no longer adhere to the ways of our ancestors. It is our utmost priority to return to the immortal customs of the days gone by. We'll appeal to the symbols, the conscious and unconscious beliefs, ancient traditions, and the myths and legends that still permeate in people's minds and conversations despite the decades or centuries of propaganda. Our veneration of the immortal values that everyone deep down identifies with will gain us much popular support and complacency, even though our state deviates drastically from the status quo."
generic_firstDESC_postpolonism_ideology_key: "The Old World is gone. Burnt to the ash. Those who wish to maintain its customs and institutions are misguided. A new era has dawned. This land is for us to shape as we see fit. Our followers have been sent to tear down old national symbols, demolish temples, and burn books. Those contain the seditious ideas that may lead our people astray. Those whose minds are easy to mold may try to recreate the old order, only for it to collapse just like it did in 2025. We can't allow this tragedy to happen. Only the most trusted and wise of us will be able to study the books of the Old World to better prevent its resurrection."

#Second descriptions
generic_secondDESC_marxism_cranism_ideology_key: "We finally gained enough recognition to be the host of the Grand Congress of [ROOT.GetRulingParty] on which will gather all the party members within our borders, as well as those from abroad. We can exit the shadows of conspiracy and openly unify and declare our goals. It's of primary importance to prevent the emergence of anarchy in our doctrine. We will work in unison, and even our cells in foreign nations will be coordinated from party headquarters. Our international forces will prepare to form the first semblances of our administration once we conquer our enemies' lands."
generic_secondDESC_squattism_ideology_key: "Most of the supporters of the anarchist cause take their origins in the urban centers. Here, both autochthons and heterochthons work as brothers and sisters to establish squats. They learned to fend for themselves, independent from the state's authorities. To do that, they learned to defend themselves from hooligans and the police. They can use their experience to teach wider masses how to handle baseballs, crowbars, and batons, so they can form the backbone of our militia. We will have no equals in urban warfare. We will have a clear edge against enemies who'll have a hard time gathering enough firearms."
generic_secondDESC_socialdemocrature_ideology_key: "The warfare left vast swaths of our land destroyed. The house-to-house fighting and bomb shelling caused massive destruction to numerous living centers. As a result, our homeless shelters are getting overcrowded already, and the influx of refugees certainly doesn't help. The private sector either profits from the decreased supply or is too poor and unsure to commit to any large investment. The state has to step right into the issue and renovate and build new housing, and finance it from the budget. This will begin the renewed settlement of the wastelands created by war. It's a humanitarian action that will also boost our economy - freeing the people from the anxiety caused by homelessness will allow them to think about increasing their consumption."
generic_secondDESC_euroliberalism_ideology_key: "We're one of the few remaining bastions of democracy in Poland. We reject the radical right-wing and left-wing notions of dictatorship or suspending people's rights for immediate gain. We uphold the ideals and guarantee the rights to private property, a fair trial, equality before the law, freedom of religion, and the presumption of innocence. Our citizens trust us to keep our words and provide them with stability, security, and freedom from tyranny. It is time to codify those rights for greater transparency. We expect this will result in a dramatic rise in support of our government."
generic_secondDESC_freemarketism_ideology_key: "The law will change to suit the individual, not the other way around! The businessmen will no longer have to wait for the arbitrary whims of the bureaucrats that can doom a promising entrepreneurship prospect. People will be free to do their business as they see fit, employing whoever they want, paying them whatever they want for whatever they want them to do. We believe the healthy competition between companies will provide the best possible setup for the employees, employers, and clients, and the regulations can only harm the optimal market result. There are those, who fear that because of those reforms, they'll be left to fend for themselves in a rapidly changing environment, but we're sure that people, who really need the help will be taken care of by charity foundations."
generic_secondDESC_paternal_conservatism_ideology_key: "We know what people truly want. We're neither detached elites who dream of radically transforming society with social engineering, nor infantile utopians dreaming of implementing dangerous delusions. Our political program is identical to what you can hear from people you meet every day on the street. We're here to be their voice and representation, protecting them from all who would want to infringe on their way of life. We know how to talk to ordinary people, and it shows in the good results of [ROOT.GetRulingParty] in the election polls. That shows we're representing the democracy in its purest form, free from any epithets that pervert it. When people demand, we oblige."
generic_secondDESC_autocracy_ideology_key: "The state is synonymous with the person of our leader. Our leader is strong, and therefore our state apparatus must be as well. Government officials must be indiscriminately loyal to [ROOT.GetLeader] and their decisions must remain unquestioned by the people. They must carry out the will of the leader as soon as possible and show independent initiative in their actions if they want to remain in their positions. They've got to have their eyes everywhere to spot every tax-evader, smuggler, criminal, or draft-dodger, so there will be no one who can bail out of supporting our country. The energetic and streamlined bureaucracy is what this country needs right now."
generic_secondDESC_corporativism_ideology_key: "We only have one primary objective and duty - to earn money for our shareholders. Everything besides that is just an optional detour. We'll run this country like we run our business. No more wasteful projects that go nowhere. We'll take a close look at every cost in our ledger and try to lower it as much as possible. We will achieve the budget surplus unimaginable to the people who grew up in a state ruled by politicians. The common folk will be grateful for learning how cheap the services can be and how low the subscription for the state can be."
generic_secondDESC_neonationalism_ideology_key: "What is Fatherland? It's the people around you, it's the meadows and fields you traversed during holidays, it's the land that raised you and fed you. Our Fatherland is not synonymous with our current territories - those are merely the result of political machinations. The deep spiritual connection of our nation with our land is something that transcends the lines drawn on a map during the negotiations of fragile armistice pacts. People need to be made aware of the truth and be ready to fight to expand our state so it will encompass every inch of the land inhabited by our people. This time, we will protect it at all costs so it won't fall to bloodthirsty invaders ever again."
generic_secondDESC_reactionary_ideology_key: "The modern, fashionable ideologies didn't stand the test of time. They were all designed by false prophets, who had no idea how human nature works, especially during hard times. We know better. We follow the ideas that were shaped in a time of eternal struggles and the way of life that survived for centuries. We believe it's time for ideology to show what it's worth now that our civilization has been turned back to step zero. Some may call our ways barbaric, but so be it. We will not consider the opinions of those who will perish in the few weeks, unable to let go of the trappings of the modern world."
generic_secondDESC_postpolonism_ideology_key: "We need to eradicate old elites and replace them with wisemen. No longer will we be ruled by secret lodges and their evil, hidden rituals. From now on, we will be led by a class of people guided by virtue and knowledge. Our influence will then extend to lower social classes. They will find new ways of greeting each other, and they will eat new food for their bodies as well as for their spirit. We shall teach them even a new language if that's what it takes to sever the ties with the years gone by."

#Third descriptions
generic_thirdDESC_marxism_cranism_ideology_key: "In spite of the clear benefit of our government to the people, there are still those who oppose us. There are those among us who prefer to serve foreign capital and sell their homeland to the imperialist forces. Unfortunately, we can't solve everything with the power of persuasion. That is why we need a competent security service to root out the subversive element. They will need to be able to monitor private conversations through the phone or the Internet, be able to ex-judicially imprison the suspects, and maintain the network of secret informants. They will look under every rock to find anyone who would try to raise their hand against the people's rule!"
generic_thirdDESC_squattism_ideology_key: "Every group of people who want to form an egalitarian, voluntary commune is free to do so. The reasons vary; Some establish production or artistic collectives. Most just want to create a living space with people they feel good with and want to do that in spite of the old zoning laws or the absurd property laws that allow de facto abandoned buildings to rot.\nThere are some who are afraid to join such zones due to what they call an unseemly environment that looks more to them like camps or a cheap joint. In their snobbism, they fail to realise how cheaper squats are to maintain or how quickly repairs or construction happen when caring people are free to help others, free from capitalist bureaucracy."
generic_thirdDESC_socialdemocrature_ideology_key: "Our more radical supporters call for even higher tax rates on the rich or even on what some may consider to be the middle class. However, the moderates point out that another tax rate would hurt our support as well as stifle our economy a bit. We can overcome this conflict of interest by using a more nuanced method: striking against tax evaders! That will increase our income and won't rally up the opposition, who also view the tax evaders as crooks.\nOur new policy will be implemented by increasing the controls over the transactions, increasing digitalization, and revising the exceptions in the tax law."
generic_thirdDESC_euroliberalism_ideology_key: "There are some universal standards we need to uphold in our economy. We can't allow this political and military crisis to turn into an economic one as well. Right now, our entrepreneurs engage in a business free-for-all, breaking the rules of occupational safety and health, not registering their activities, and refusing to pay their employees. To uphold civilized standards and to be allowed in the European markets, we'll have to reintroduce some old regulations. Some lament we're killing our economy, but in reality, we're just taming it. There is also the fact that we can enforce the best and most effective methods of production to guide newly established start-ups instead of leaving them to fend for themselves."
generic_thirdDESC_freemarketism_ideology_key: "We need something to start our economy. Right now, our business class does whatever they can to keep us afloat, but that won't be enough. We need to give some of them a head start as well as attract some foreign investors. As we found out, most of them are too scared to start any initiative on our lands due to a lack of political stability. To raise the number of investments, we'll need to present a really good offer to convince them to risk their money. That's why we'll create special economic zones, where taxes will be virtually non-existent for a set amount of time. We can only choose a few corporations to have those privileges if we want to have any semblance of a budget. Despite the costs in the long run, this move will benefit us greatly."
generic_thirdDESC_paternal_conservatism_ideology_key: "Family is the first and fundamental social cell. A man and a woman dedicated to giving life and raising their children. That's what ensures the continuation of our nation in the first place. We're surprised it needs to be reminded. Alas, the years of liberal propaganda poisoned the minds of men, who are no longer eager to become the heads of their families and the minds of women, downplaying the importance of motherhood, promoting a ruthless pursuit of career instead. We need to change this course, but the promotion of ideals won't be enough. By building more nurseries and providing continuous financial support to multi-child families, we plan to materially encourage the return to good old-fashioned values that we used to rely on."
generic_thirdDESC_autocracy_ideology_key: "You know why we can't have democracy? Because only a strict core of our nation wants to work for the common good! We're expanding more rapidly than we can integrate and assimilate the conquered people. Had they been given the right to vote, our country would collapse, returning us to step one. Let's face it, our state is filled with numerous rebel groups, and only an autocrat can root them out before they start going after the innocent civilians. For the time being, the so-called civil rights will have to be more carefully implemented for the sake of security. Let's be honest, whose rights are more important to uphold? Those of law-abiding citizens or the rebels, who only want to hurt others and destroy what we tirelessly built?"
generic_thirdDESC_corporativism_ideology_key: "The territories of Poland have become a breeding ground for all sorts of mercenaries. As it should be. Everyone knows that changing market influences what career choices people make. We live in dangerous times, and people have learned to be able to protect themselves and offer their services to earn money. The abandoned veterans, the rogue policemen, people who just picked up the best weapon they could find. They all have families to feed; we're doing them a service by employing them. Not to mention people in our territories, we'll be thankful if we want to spend some more money instead of extending the conscription. What else is great about the mercenaries? They have little loyalty to anything besides money."
generic_thirdDESC_neonationalism_ideology_key: "The parts of our homeland that lie beyond our borders are limbs cut off from the body. They are left on their own to the invasion of maggots that hasten the decay. Thankfully, the body of our nation is capable of great regeneration. We've proven that before. All it takes is to get rid of the maggots that infest what is ours, and we will be free to begin the process of healing. So, get ready to fight! Pick up the weapons and charge at the enemy element. Do not hesitate to strike even if you're not sure who to kill. Sometimes an additional amputation is better than the risk of the festering infection."
generic_thirdDESC_reactionary_ideology_key: "We will pay much mind to our traditions and norms. Every citizen will observe the holidays that may have become forgotten as time goes by. They will dress, behave, and speak the way our ancestors did. Only with strict control over the population will the proper way of life cement the ancient values for the generation to come. The past serves as a great guide on how to fare in the world of today and tomorrow. Only now do people start to realize that the ancient values are not antiquated, but timeless."
generic_thirdDESC_postpolonism_ideology_key: "The shepherds must go among the sheep to properly guide them. So we must send our teachers into the field to oversee local communities and answer their questions. We can't just nail our theses to the door and think our work is done. Every day, those who doubt and those who attack us raise their heads. We need to deal with them directly. We need to teach people and inspire them by talking with them face-to-face. Then the people directed by the newly found fervor will follow their Guardians to fight against those who would like to extinguish the light of the Truth."

#Fourth descriptions
generic_fourthDESC_marxism_cranism_ideology_key: "The bloodthirsty imperialistic fascists, the reactionary priests, the greedy capitalists. All of them still remain inside our borders. These are the sicknesses we were infected with by the carcasses of the systems we already trampled. We have the medicine, now it's only a matter of using it regularly; We will censor their papers, ban them from television, investigate them and their families, put them on trial, and keep them in jail or exile them. Freeing our country from their influence will be another step in building a better future for everyone. One that would be free from the antiquated burdens of the failed ideologies."
generic_fourthDESC_squattism_ideology_key: "We don't need a profit incentive to work. It is apparent that we need industrial production, and helpful workers are ready to work for their community. They create production collectives that are democratically governed, and every worker has an equal say in what and how it is produced. They are relatively small, but are willing to cooperate with other such workshops, creating a harmonious and highly decentralized system. This structure of economy is just highly adaptable and is able to support our cause, as well as or even better than the capitalist or centrally planned organizations of production."
generic_fourthDESC_socialdemocrature_ideology_key: "No one can deny that private business is needed for a well-functioning economy; The communist system showed us how the alternative fares. We are no liberals, however, and our toleration of the private sector does not mean we support all of its airs. Right now, the entrepreneurs spread the propaganda that to rebuild the state, every worker has to overwork themselves to catch up to the West. We will not tolerate those lies. We will introduce a complex series of laws aimed at easing the suffering of the employees. We can see through the veil of neoliberal lies and know that the worker who has time to relax is a more effective worker."
generic_fourthDESC_euroliberalism_ideology_key: "The war that has raged for all those years has left numerous housing districts destroyed. Because of that, despite the population dwindling due to the civilian casualties and lowered birthrates, we're short on houses for our citizens to live in. We need to do something about it, and what's even more important, our voters need to see we're doing something about it. As a believer in an active state that cooperates with the private sector, we propose a program of subsidizing the building of apartments by the developers. That way, we can show we can dirty our hands and help people, while not disturbing the market."
generic_fourthDESC_freemarketism_ideology_key: "The freed potential of our population surprises even the most optimistic of our sympathizers. Our economy blooms, and more and more sectors are being privatised, even those that the public thought must be state-owned. While the regular business owner continues to expand their activities, remaining in relative safety, the pioneers experiment in areas so far mostly unclaimed by the market, such as the medical insurance research sector, research and development, and security. Now that the state's usurpation of these sectors has been broken down, effectiveness has skyrocketed, while costs have dropped exponentially."
generic_fourthDESC_paternal_conservatism_ideology_key: "Some people think we're against all changes, but that is a vile lie. Anyone who has spared a few minutes talking with our politicians or supporters knows that we're only against sudden and drastic changes that go against the core of our civilizational values. We're against social experiments and revolutions, because we know they do more harm than good. We're more than happy to modify our worldview and policies once we're sure said modifications are necessary and beneficial to society and have already been proven to work elsewhere. After all, it's good to learn from mistakes, even better when they're the mistakes of others. Of course, we'll be the judges of what ideas are worth implementing and how much time must pass for a reform to be considered successful in the long run."
generic_fourthDESC_autocracy_ideology_key: "Ok, maybe we need a little bit of democracy. Dealing with armed resistance is one thing, but there are still those who feel our government doesn't represent them. While they're not willing to conspire to overthrow us, they perform the tasks we give them neglectfully. They quietly yearn for representation in the parliament, an opposition. We can't let them run rampant, though. Our leader controls every aspect of our politics; Why should things be any different with the opposition? Even if we allow them to officially co-rule with us, their influence will be marginal. They serve to liberalize the public discussion in a reasonable manner. Maybe this will appease those who call us tyrants behind our backs."
generic_fourthDESC_corporativism_ideology_key: "We are not anti-unions, but we are not neutral either. We will boldly defend our direct relationships with our direct associates, as best for our associates, our customers, and our shareholders. We do not believe the unions are in the best interest of anyone. Our business model is built upon speed, innovation, and customer obsession. Things that are not generally associated with unions. When we lose sight of those critical focus areas, we jeopardize everyone's job security.\nWe have methods to meet their organization with the initiative of our own. Encouraging people to strikebreak, firing the loudest of the union members, but if those methods won't work, we will, for the good of our associates, hire unmarked men as 'a security' to have a direct talk with anyone who would think about starting violence."
generic_fourthDESC_neonationalism_ideology_key: "We are first and foremost a collective. The individual enjoys the pleasure of life primarily because other members of the nation gave something to him. On his own, he wouldn't be able to complete most of what he considers to be his own achievements. The strength comes from community, and each community's strength is primarily determined by its numerosity. Young people need to marry as soon as possible and have as many children as they can provide for. The children will be soldiers of the future, ensuring that our nation won't face another genocide. They will turn the saddening demographic trends, so we won't have to import a foreign workforce."
generic_fourthDESC_reactionary_ideology_key: "Without our ancestors, we wouldn't be where we are today. Not only in the biological sense. We wouldn't be who we are without their intellectual contribution to our culture and their blood spilled for the cause they cared about, the same cause we fight for. We can still learn much from them. Our society once more needs knights who will fight with honor and grace for the mission that is greater than themselves. Aside from moral and spiritual reasons, mounted cavalry is much more affordable than mobile infantry. By delving deep into martial treatises of old, we will have no equals in close-quarter combat."
generic_fourthDESC_postpolonism_ideology_key: "Those who, in their wisdom, decide to submit to our cause need to be properly rewarded. Of course, our followers don't join our cause for material gain, but for a higher purpose. Unfortunately, some ornament may be needed to convince the new initiates. Our most faithful supporters will be praised publicly. The statues of them will be erected in the place where they were born. Children will learn from their endeavours in school. They will inspire new people to step into their place when they're gone. The people will worship them and send them money and valuables, asking them for a blessing."

#Fifth descriptions
generic_fifthDESC_marxism_cranism_ideology_key: "The public companies we conquered, and those that were left unprotected by fleeing capitalists, are now returned to the working class. We made a great first step to end exploitation. Our system is not only fairer and without contradictions, but what's most important - more effective. Now we produce only what's necessary for the people. The local councils report the needs of the people to the central committee, which then makes the decisions regarding what to produce. Thanks to that, we eliminated the anarchy of production, where dozens of producers would wastefully create the same product with cosmetic differences."
generic_fifthDESC_squattism_ideology_key: "We refuse to subscribe to the view that only work that achieves monetary profit is worth doing. History is full of people who greatly enriched our sensitivity or made us rethink the core issues about humanity and, despite their genius, died in poverty. We're talking about painters, writers, and composers - the great artists of the past. We are aware that the core of our supporters got interested in our ideas thanks to art that traverses borders, despite what the hostile rulers think about it. Can you imagine a more anarchist thing?\nWe are sure that art will still serve our purpose of spreading the ideals of liberty both to those who live inside our free territory as well as to those who still live a shackled life."
generic_fifthDESC_socialdemocrature_ideology_key: "In the times of rising authoritarianism and militarism, it is more important than ever to keep our democratic process transparent, fair, and equal. We will aim to become a model democracy to earn the praise of foreign observers by allowing a fair debate with the opposition parties (at least the ones we'll deem as democratic) and keeping the state media as impartial as possible. This will boost our legitimacy and make foreign countries look more favorably on our cause. It may also help to turn people's attention away from the rising authoritarianism within our party that keeps the old elites safe in their seats."
generic_fifthDESC_euroliberalism_ideology_key: "People can complain about the overbureaucratization all they want, but after the Fall, the number of government officials decreased dramatically, and our administration atrophied. Raising taxes, increasing conscription, or coming up with new policies if we can't implement them or control how they're being carried out. We need our boys and girls in the field... umm, offices to fight for our causes. Thanks to them, we'll know exactly how many people live within our borders, how much they earn, and how much we're entitled to tax. We'll know how many eligible people we have for conscription and how many of them are dodging it. "
generic_fifthDESC_freemarketism_ideology_key: "For too long, our people have been complacent. The previous regime kept them from bettering themselves. It stifled social mobility through the overregulation and then subsidised the ineffective way of life. We need to unleash the energy of our people to reach the stars. We will search for the rags-to-riches stories and promote them nationwide. People must learn that the shackles of the past have been broken, and they are now free to pursue their happiness unbothered by the state. Our efforts will hopefully fill the hearts of potential innovators to change the world for the better."
generic_fifthDESC_paternal_conservatism_ideology_key: "While we endorse a healthy competition of private parties, we are aware that there are some sectors of the economy that are too valuable to be left to the whims of the market. Sectors such as energetics, finances, transportation, farming, pharmacy, and resource extraction need additional protections, so the national producers have a space to develop in special conditions, so they can compete with foreign giants in times of peace. Those policies are especially wise in times of war when those most important sectors can be susceptible to a takeover and sabotage by our foreign enemies or perform additional services to our army."
generic_fifthDESC_autocracy_ideology_key: "Our model of rulership relies on the 'stick and carrot' method. We've used a lot of sticks now, it's time for some carrots. Well, it'll be more like projecting an image of a carrot on the wall. We'll not give people any more than we already do; We'll just teach them to appreciate what we've already achieved. We'll show how people happily enjoy the opportunities and security we provide, they'll be informed of the wise reforms of our great leader, and see our enemies for what they are - the bloodthirsty monsters. Our message will be delivered through television, radio, the Internet, and even in cinemas. The children will learn about the good we bring about in schools."
generic_fifthDESC_corporativism_ideology_key: "We can't allow our productivity to drop due to employee disengagement. We can monitor the work in our establishments, but we can't have eyes everywhere. We need to offer additional benefits to those who perform beyond their limits. We need to elevate their position to show all what a proper work ethic looks like. We need to instill fear of being replaced in every worker who thinks about underperforming. Rewarding those who will inform us about underperforming fellow employees would also help, just like spreading rumors about potential backstabbing in the pursuit of a higher position. Each worker will feel someone's breath down on their neck."
generic_fifthDESC_neonationalism_ideology_key: "We need to protect our national producers. Before the Fall, this land was completely sold to the foreign bankers, whose lobbying slowly eroded our nation. We can't allow that to happen. We will severely regulate the amount of foreign investment that is possible. We will protect the interests of national companies, especially those that provide strategic resources or whose products are important for our culture. Only then can we consider opening our borders, but only on the condition that our trade balance will be decisively in our favor. We also won't forget about the small business owner, the backbone of our nation, who offer their services to their direct neighbours, strengthening the local ties. They will be able to count on special subsidies to develop their businesses."
generic_fifthDESC_reactionary_ideology_key: "The natural order is something that transcends the past, present, and the future; It came about due to unchangeable truths of the universe. Unfortunately, our followers don't know how to implement these immortal values in the world that shunned them. This causes them to escape with their thoughts to the past, hoping it will be restored completely down to every detail, necessary or not. We can't have that. We are destined to rule this Earth until the end of time, and that means adapting. We'll have to separate the additional beliefs that built up over the years from the true axioms of our cause. Despite not changing the bedrock of our teachings, such purification will raise some voices that treat even the non-canonical practices with the same sacredness as the core of our system."
generic_fifthDESC_postpolonism_ideology_key: "Our organization is full of virtuous and wise people who deserve to be praised, but everyone has to remember they are merely the pale reflections and imitations of our wise leader - [ROOT.GetLeader]. [ROOT.GetLeader] was the one who discovered the Truth and used the newly gained knowledge to codify new laws and teach his henchmen to send them as Avatars to places, [ROOT.GetLeader] can't walk. As we might venerate our closest teachers, we must remember that only the supreme leader's world is law, and if someone, no matter how high his level of initiation is, contradicts that, they must be tried for their crimes."

#Sixth descriptions
generic_sixthDESC_marxism_cranism_ideology_key: "Not all of the parasites were left at the sight of the people's army's march. A shame. There still is a class of petite bourgeoisie, as well as wealthy landowners, that sabotage our economy. They openly defy our directives, and the farmers even prefer to destroy their crops and equipment rather than share them with their community. They dare to fatten themselves while their brethren work tirelessly to build a just society. We initially tolerated them, hoping they'd enlist in collective farms, but alas, they chose to terrorize their society. Enough with niceties, we'll order them to relinquish their land and businesses or suffer dire consequences."
generic_sixthDESC_squattism_ideology_key: "Our cause can't go by on the broad ideas of freedom only. We need to spread the theory so our people will know the details of their cause, how to organize themselves, and how to fight an overwhelming enemy. Our informed comrades will spend days and nights printing leaflets and manifestos to cover street lamps. They will also send them abroad to raise awareness of the enslaved. The best orators will ready themselves to summarize the points made by the great thinkers of anarchism. Who knows, maybe some of the inhabitants will even pick up Proudhon.\nWe know that the printing press has already brought an end to the Middle Ages. We believe it can do so once again."
generic_sixthDESC_socialdemocrature_ideology_key: "Due to the chaos of war, people are afraid or unable to invest in their own or their children's education. Many neglect it and focus on mastering the physical labor, or are forced or persuaded to stay at home and help with the chores there. That is unacceptable and short-sighted. Education has been defined as a human right, and besides, our country won't be able to function with illiterates instead of specialists. We will invest heavily in education and enforce the law of mandatory education of children even more thoroughly; We won't let the littlest ones be robbed of their future. We will also increase grants to the most marginalized groups to further decrease social inequalities."
generic_sixthDESC_euroliberalism_ideology_key: "The corrupt politicians make the other 10% look bad. Despite our efforts to properly reward our party members and government officials, some still can't help themselves when an option to enrich themselves through alternative means appears. And people started to notice that some local politicians drive a bit too fancy cars for someone of their income. Or that some of the money dedicated to the war-torn families got lost somewhere. Or that the new bench in a park is 10 times as expensive as it should be. We have to put an end to that before it's too late for us. Of course, we'll not get rid of all of the corruption, just the most egregious cases. After all, some additional incentive to enter the world of politics is always needed."
generic_sixthDESC_freemarketism_ideology_key: "The shift in our society includes all of the facets of life, including academia, especially the various economics departments in Universities, giving voice to the previously mostly unheard opinions. Such voices belong to the economists associated with the Austrian School. For decades, they've been marginalized by the mainstream, but we believe the ideas of great thinkers such as Mises, Hayek, and Rothbard can be implemented by our government. For example, their ideas may help us avoid cyclical crises and inflation by freeing the banking sector or introducing the gold standard. The innovative approach of Austrian economists can also allow us to better adapt to a world where the importance of cryptocurrencies has risen dramatically."
generic_sixthDESC_paternal_conservatism_ideology_key: "We denounce both socialism and laissez-faire capitalism. The former, for giving too much power to the state to unnaturally interfere in people's lives, and the latter, for its ruthless exploitation of the workers, as if they were mere instruments. We support capitalism with a human face, the one where people are generally free to engage with each other economically, but with certain restrictions that protect human dignity and welfare. There will be some state intervention in the form of regulation and financial redistribution, but said intervention will not be overbearing or deprive the cells of our societies of their rights and duties. The state will only step in to help those downtrodden to enable them to once again stand on their own two feet, so the natural order of things would continue."
generic_sixthDESC_autocracy_ideology_key: "We are in a state of perpetual war. Our state needs to function like an army and with the army. There can be no place for second thoughts, lack of discipline, or desertion. Everyone in our state must know their place and carry out the orders they're given. Everyone, from the lowliest workers and vendors to the officials at the highest echelons of government, must acknowledge they're part of one unified structure and act in accordance with that belief. The order must be enforced meticulously and ruthlessly to achieve our long-term goal.\nWe must be ever-ready to follow the lead of our dear leader."
generic_sixthDESC_corporativism_ideology_key: "The Fall of Poland set our economic development decades ago. We'll need to work tirelessly to reach the levels of welfare people enjoyed before 2025. To achieve that, we'll have to part ways with the typical maximum number of 40 work hours per week, as well as with Saturdays being free from work. The new system is colloquially called the 996 system - work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week, resulting in a total of 72 hours a week. Tough times require tough decisions. It will rile some of the workers against us, but that is to be expected. We'll try to calm them by pointing out that their bosses, even the board of the company, will also work as long as the common employee."
generic_sixthDESC_neonationalism_ideology_key: "The precautions we took are not enough. The foreign agents and hostile ideologies passed right under our noses, pretending to be traders. We learned that only political and military sovereignty can allow us to survive and thrive. It's time for us to realise that economic sovereignty is the next logical step. We will appropriate the foreign capital for the benefit of the common good and use it to further develop national business. We will be truly independent from the foreign influence as well as the turbulence of the foreign markets that strip the veneer of growth and every other decade bring the time of unimaginable strife. From now on, only our nation will steer the ship of the economy to conquer foreign seas."
generic_sixthDESC_reactionary_ideology_key: "Our ideology triumphed in the past, showed its worth in the present, and more and more people are starting to believe the future also belongs to us. We're on the way to change the cultural zeitgeist through sheer force of will, despite all odds. We're not just a stopping block on the path to the abyss; We steered the culture away from it. All signs in heaven and earth show us this change is permanent. Our enemies are ostracised from public life as the common people ready their pitchforks against them. The members of the old modernist salon are either quiet or start to stroke us, feeling the wind of change."
generic_sixthDESC_postpolonism_ideology_key: "We have begun a process of creating a new man, a completely new subspecies! It has been proven that after reaching the highest mysteries of our order, a person's very DNA is changed. The instincts that were thought to be biologically intrinsic to human nature were removed completely. Those who follow our way are no longer burdened by the faulty reptilian parts of the brain. In turn, they become much more intelligent, moral, and more eager to engage in physical exercise. We hope that as we continue our proselytizing mission, more and more people will uncover their hidden potential, and the lands upon Vistula will be completely inhabited by Homo Novum."
