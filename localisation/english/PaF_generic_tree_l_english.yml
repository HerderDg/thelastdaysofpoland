unification_generic.1.desc: "Through cunning intrigue and swift military conquest, [FROM.GetName] has become a regional power. Once surrounded by enemies, under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] it has subjugated and united the lands and people of the local voivodeship. Having consolidated territory surrounding its heartland, people of [FROM.GetName] look further beyond their borders, while the military staff draws new warplans. Only future will tell if Poland has a new contender for unification, or was it just a fluke of luck."

unificationreg_generic.1.desc: "Having united it's local voivodeship, [FROM.GetName] continues to grow in power within it's region. Town after town, county after county fall before it's marching armies. [FROM.GetLeader] assures it's not blind luck and promises that the people of [FROM.GetName] are destined for greatness, as the vision of prosperous life in a united Poland begins to materialise. Military and economy of the nation swell with new conquests and promise of upcoming unification seem to be slowly turning into reality."

unificationsupreg_generic.1.desc: "Standing proud among fallen adversaries and their beliefs, [FROM.GetName] has attained a position of a unification contender. Having attained a large portion of pre-fall territory of Poland, aspirations of [FROM.GetLeader] seem to be only growing larger. With an army stronger than ever before, supported by a homefront - prosperity and unity of which rivals that of the pre-fall Poland, people of [FROM.GetName] seem certain that ultimate victory is just around the corner. Growing legitimacy of the government under [FROM.GetLeader] seems to only reinforce the confidence, that spreads among the common populace. Upcoming months will show if that confidence is misguided, or the dreams of a unified Poland aren't meant to remain simple imaginations for much longer."
unificationsupreg_generic.1.a: "Concerning."

super_generic.1.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super_generic.1.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."

generic_increase_the_conscription_idea: "Increased Conscription"
generic_increase_the_conscription_idea_desc: "If we want an army, we need people willing to sacrifice themselves for their country. While there are always willing and unwilling, we can always reach both sides when it comes to the survival of their families and our country. Therefore, we will launch a mobilization campaign for those who can be useful in the fight. And whoever doesn't fight, let them work; without mutual cooperation, our country won't last long. Sometimes we will convince them with words, sometimes with force, but this is necessary if we want to live to see tomorrow. Our ancestors, who also fought, would have wanted us to demonstrate heroism during the fall of our nation."

It's not enough for these people that it's either us or them; we must train them to understand the basics, to be fit and ready to fight, to help their comrades in arms, and even to become future commanders leading their troops to victory. The better we train them, the greater the chance they'll survive and win the confrontation with our enemies! Okay, gentlemen, now you're going to run 2 kilometers and do 40 push-ups, MOVE, MOVE!!!"

generic_last_days_of_poland: "Last Days of Poland"
generic_last_days_of_poland_desc: "Not long ago, beyond the mountains, beyond the forests, there was a country called Poland, unfortunately pride led to its downfall. Now we are in a lonely wasteland among the ruins of the dark ages, now our task is to survive what awaits us! We came here with our own mission and vision, a very difficult, brave journey full of challenges awaits us, but we will never give up! The beginnings of history have never been easy, but our determined purpose will lead us straight to the horizon! Time to rise like a phoenix from the ashes!"
generic_experiences_of_the_fall: "Experiences of the Fall"
generic_experiences_of_the_fall_desc: "Recently, there have been many drastic events that we have more or less witnessed, and we realize that a new combat strategy is needed, which we will follow. The problem is that we have something that doesn't resemble our former army, but an ordinary, angry mob of civilians. We must learn from this painful time and adapt, otherwise the law of the jungle will decide our fate. Let's find books, find inspiration, and a series of strategies; this will be useful to our commanders who will lead the army to victory! A strong state means a strong army. We are animals, and this is our nature; kill or be killed!"
generic_increase_the_conscription: "Increase the Conscription"
generic_increase_the_conscription_desc: "If we want an army, we need people willing to sacrifice themselves for their country. While there are always willing and unwilling, we can always reach both sides when it comes to the survival of their families and our country.

Our ancestors, who also fought, would have wanted us to demonstrate heroism during the fall of our nation."
generic_handpick_the_officers: "Handpick the Officers"
generic_handpick_the_officers_desc: "A body is only as capable as the brain that leads it, that much is certain. Therefore, we must focus on picking the correct generals, both from previously present military bodies as well as above-averagely-trained individuals, in order to lead our army. While this will take resources away from the training of our troops, it's better to have competent leadership and incompetent troops than competent troops and incompetent leadership."
generic_train_our_troops: "Train our Troops"
generic_train_our_troops_desc: "Our army, unfortunately, is composed mostly of ordinary civilians who are now expected to take up arms, go into battle, and sometimes even kill their own former neighbors. It's not enough for these people that it's either us or them; we must train them to understand the basics, to be fit and ready to fight, to help their comrades in arms, and even to become future commanders leading their troops to victory. The better we train them, the greater the chance they'll survive and win the confrontation with our enemies! Okay, gentlemen, now you're going to run 2 kilometers and do 40 push-ups, MOVE, MOVE!!!"
generic_homemade_equipment: "Homemade Equipment"
generic_homemade_equipment_desc: "Well, what was once Poland is certain to have been terribly disarmed and pathetically prepared for the collapse that has left us now with a hopeless situation, with weapons that barely resemble weapons. Purchasing weapons from abroad isn't enough; we must produce our own equipment to ensure our soldiers have the necessary defense. Therefore, from now on, every stick, kitchen knife, or even an old air rifle will be handcrafted, utilizing creative DIY enthusiasts who will craft weapons in makeshift workshops! Over time, the more we learn, the better our weapons will become. Starting from scratch will never be easy, but a small step forward is a big step for our survival."
generic_guns_and_butter: "Guns&Butter"
generic_guns_and_butter_desc: "Supply, no matter how you look at it, is one of the key elements of military life. An army without food, ammunition, or new weapons won't survive long in a war situation, and even the best commanders, like Napoleon, can't do anything against an army without supplies. To prevent "there's nothing we can do" scenarios, we must carefully plan the quantity and quality of our supplies. It would also be worthwhile to expand rail lines and vehicles for supply delivery. And if we plan everything well, everything will run smoothly in the uncertain future that awaits us all."
generic_origins_of_the_getarmyname: "[GetLocGenArmyFocus]"
generic_origins_of_the_getarmyname_desc: "With our military matters settled and the groundwork of an actual army present, we can officially begin the process of administrational registration of the entity that will soon defend our borders, the [GetArmyName]. This process will hopefully take a shorter amount of time than the actually practical stuff... hopefully. After all, we have a region to unite real soon."
generic_condition_of_the_getname: "Condition of the [ROOT.GetName]"
generic_condition_of_the_getname_desc: "Let's face it: times are bad, they're worse than bad, they're crazy! A złoty buys a groszy's worth (if anything at all more than a piece of string and a kick in the ass), and the food is unfit to breathe and the air unsafe to eat. That's why we need to, coloquially speaking, get our shit together, and figure out what to do with this mess. Actually organising the government to deal with the problems of the current situation is a good first step, setting up departments and ministries to deal with existing problems will surely help us get back on our feet and ready to roll with the punches of fate."
generic_meeting_of_the_getrulingparty: "Meeting of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty]"
generic_meeting_of_the_getrulingparty_desc: "It's time for a meeting with the most important figures in the party. We need to determine who is doing what and how we should manage the state during this time of chaos and turmoil in our region. The meeting will also aim to prepare the ground for the future of our government and what promises we will make to our residents. Ultimately, we also want to cultivate party loyalty that will maintain the stable government necessary to keep our country in check. Without a united government, there's no hope of rallying citizens behind the common cause of our new nation. Where one goes, we all go!"
generic_ideological_dogmas_of_getrulingideology: "Ideological Dogmas of [ROOT.GetRulingIdeologyNoun]"
generic_ideological_dogmas_of_getrulingideology_desc: "We have an idea we want to pass on to future generations, but how can we express our dreams for realization? At the meeting, we will tell our residents what kind of future we are planning for them. We are convinced that our idea will solve all social, economic, and national problems! While this is one small step for man, it is a giant leap for our country. An idea is the fuel that will give us purpose in a hopeless world."
generic_country_on_the_collision_course: "Country on the Collision Course"
generic_country_on_the_collision_course_desc: "Unfortunately, the times of peace were short-lived. Tensions with warlords are rising through endless areas and even in our region; war is inevitable! Therefore, we will ensure the safety of our citizens and prepare for every scenario; otherwise, we will wake up with our hands in the potty, something no one wants! We must firmly accept reality. The fight for survival will not end until Poland is united. Now we have the task to fulfill it! Even with blood and sweat, courage and determination in the darkest of times, we will win this conflict together, united!"
generic_improve_the_administration: "Improve the Administration"
generic_improve_the_administration_desc: ""
generic_emergency_workshops: "Emergency Workshops"
generic_emergency_workshops_desc: "The economic situation is critical! Our economy is ground to nothing, a pile of rubble and stones thanks to a lost war. Since the world won't save us, we must take matters into our own hands before things get any worse! To produce anything, we need factories, which are currently closed or damaged. And since electricity barely exists in our patch of land, it's high time to build emergency workshops to produce weapons and combat equipment for soldiers. Without this crucial foundation, our chances of survival are close to zero. A good start to a stable economy that will ensure our survival!"
generic_scavenging_for_food: "Scavenging for Food"
generic_scavenging_for_food_desc: "Our country is almost in a state of anarchy, and civilians are beginning to starve and worry about the future. The war has caused many people to flee and leave behind their belongings. In this situation, if we don't want to be devoured by the hungry crowd, we must search for food. We will search every abandoned house, shop, and hangar for every morsel of food for our compatriots! It's already a scarce commodity, so if we believe we can not only feed our country but also share it with the less fortunate during such a difficult time, something we could never have imagined until recently."
generic_longing_for_the_energy: "Longing for the Energy"
generic_longing_for_the_energy_desc: "Energy, electricity, is humanity's most important invention in the 21st century. Without it, we don't have most of the things we need, and without electricity, our country will be sliding into an abyss we don't want to be in! That's why we'll search every abandoned IT store, warehouse, power plant, and even home, looking for generators, batteries, or anything that will keep us energetically alive! Without electricity, not only will we be unable to build anything or build anything efficient, but our lives will be much worse, and none of us wants to return to caves, right?"
generic_patching_the_budget_hole: "Patching the Budget Hole"
generic_patching_the_budget_hole_desc: "The financial situation is, one could say, in agony. The currency and economic crisis, with hyperinflation before the collapse, and finally the disintegration of Poland, has meant that if we are to build or buy anything, we desperately need money, which we literally don't have. Therefore, we will begin collecting taxes from our citizens and finding ways to earn money through sales or trade. We will search every place that holds money. Since no one holds it, we will exploit it. And since we have no intention of becoming a tribe, and a state without money is bankrupt, no longer existing in the wider world, there is no way out. Time for a tax inspection!"
generic_anything_we_have_to_offer: "Anything We Have To Offer"
generic_anything_we_have_to_offer_desc: "Free markets... trade, they say, always solve all problems if you have something to offer. We have raw materials, food, and smaller treasures to trade. If we bargain well and flexibly, we have a greater chance of making a profit, and the richer we are, the stronger our state will be. Perhaps we can even buy ourselves time to prepare for the worst ahead? We can build a future with trade, but we must approach it cleverly; otherwise, we will be consumed by the invisible hand of the market, or by other warlords who have done better than us. We'll roll the dice and see how this gambit plays out..."
generic_anything_we_can_dig_out: "Anything We Can Dig Out"
generic_anything_we_can_dig_out_desc: "In a world where everyone has the same goal as us, there's no point in trading with warlords who will conquer us or us! Therefore, we will secure our future by mining as many resources as possible, looting all the scrap, garbage, and other essential materials we need to create anything. The more we keep these resources with us, the more we will produce in our fields, and then we will be more prepared for any scenario that befalls us. It's either us or them. Time to dig as much as we can, or the world will dig our grave!"
generic_semblances_of_economy: "Semblances of Economy"
generic_semblances_of_economy_desc: "The worst is behind us... we've built anything resembling an economy, generating meager profits and extracting the energy, food, and raw materials we need from our wallets. However, the future holds many more challenges for us to adapt to. Although this economy still leaves much to be desired, we are slowly on the right track to improving our situation. All we need to do is play our cards right, and maybe we'll wake up in a pool of gold. Patience never hurts."
generic_calm_before_the_storm: "Calm Before the Storm"
generic_calm_before_the_storm_desc: "We have everything ready, we're prepared for the worst; right now, there's a calm like the lull before a storm. Normally, it's better to enjoy the time and peace, but that's where the downside lies. Let's be vigilant for every eventuality; without it, our fight could end sooner and worse than we thought! Enemies lurk all around, each with their own tools and plans, so we must have them too. Let's wait for the right moment to strike, and these small habits and preparations can determine our survival."
generic_heirs_of_the_nation: "Heirs of the Nation"
generic_heirs_of_the_nation_desc: "Dear citizens! The time of reckoning has arrived at our gates! We must fight for our country as our grandparents and ancestors did. Without you, we will not hold off the enemies at our gates! We will fight to the end and until victory. We will plant new seeds of the future that will be us in the barbarian wasteland! We stand at the crossroads of our existence. Whether we want to survive or not, the fate of you, your families, and your dreams depends on you! Ask not what our country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country! It is up to you, my fellow citizens, whether we will fulfill the dream of a better nation for ourselves and for future generations!"
generic_supply_caches: "Supply Caches"
generic_supply_caches_desc: "Supplies are an essential element of war. Without supplies, victory in war is impossible, even if our army were the most modern in the world. We should not imitate or repeat the mistakes of previous wars. Therefore, we must take care of our soldiers at such a critical time, whether it be a time of war or a temporary period of peace. We need supply points in our region to replenish the most essential supplies for soldiers: weapons, ammunition, fuel, and food. While we still have functioning factories and willing workers, let's use them to build before it's too late!"
generic_strike_at_enemy_logistics: "Strike At Enemy Logistics"
generic_strike_at_enemy_logistics_desc: "Alright boys, now it's time for some action straight out of Little Sabotage! Our enemies have vulnerable points that we must exploit to our advantage, so we will blow up or sabotage every enemy logistics system—the more damage we cause, the better! In common tradition, guerrilla warfare has always been useful in any situation we can now exploit to our advantage! There are many objects to sabotage: supply points, railways, roads, and other vital structures where, if we pull a stunt on our enemies, they might even fall to our knees. So, gentlemen, let's grab our pipe bombs, Molotov cocktails, and other tools and set out for victory!"
generic_cheap_drone_warfare: "Cheap Drone Warfare"
generic_cheap_drone_warfare_desc: "Drones... groundbreaking 21st-century technology, why not reuse it? You see, son, drones are now very useful in modern warfare. Besides flying and observing beautiful landscapes or someone in a window, they can be used for infiltration, to peer into enemy camps, sabotage, or bombing raids. Even the cheapest, homemade drones from a garage can help us avoid ambushes and traps we least expect. Let's use them like true soldiers for this war. And for outstanding computer geeks and seasoned strategy gamers, they will now have a real task to play... for the benefit of our country!"
generic_in_search_of_guns: "In Search of Guns"
generic_in_search_of_guns_desc: "With great consideration, especially looking at our current scenario and condition. It has been deemed necessary to go and search for guns rather than put all efforts into mass production, as in our current state we need as many guns as we can get, and even if it’s only a short term thing, it’d still lead to a quick and large surplus of weaponry if successful. Another move taken to get enough guns will be the formation of secret corps to move into certain other states to take guns from them. Although this may be a very risky move, the payoff doubles the risk at hand."
generic_tools_of_close_combat: "Tools of Close Combat"
generic_tools_of_close_combat_desc: "As warfare becomes more commonplace and a higher likelihood for our people, we must recognize that an arguably more important factor to said warfare than ranged combat, with that being close combat. Our troops are currently mainly supplied with anything they can pick up melee weaponry wise. And because of this the military is… less than satisfactory when it comes to close combat or hand to hand combat, with these ideas in mind scavenging will begin to happen, trying to get a single few melee weapons uniform across our whole military, and training our military in close quarters combat."
generic_support_equipment_for_troops: "Support Equipment For Troops"
generic_support_equipment_for_troops_desc: "Our troops, no matter what, would crumble on their own without any support. We must supply our troops with ample support equipment to prevent said crumbling in any military engagement from happening. Even if it’s something minor, we need support equipment to supply our troops with different specific corps, like engineering corps, recon corps and even certain combat corps like flamethrowers."
generic_seize_civilian_vehicles: "Seize Civilian Vehicles"
generic_seize_civilian_vehicles_desc: "Even though the popularity of this move is lacking, it is needed to keep our state standing and surviving, no matter how popular or unpopular we need vehicles for the military, whether it be for supply purposes or to commandeer for assault or defense purposes. Though, we must keep a certain standard or quality regarding the vehicles we seize, as a mini cooper has no value to us at all, from its size to strength. Even though this may limit the amount of vehicles that are seized, standards need to be kept up and definitely met to preserve the lives and souls of the men that drive them, whether it be manning the guns or driving them."
generic_expanding_the_capital: "Expanding [ROOT.Capital.GetName]"
generic_expanding_the_capital_desc: "Ah, [ROOT.Capital.GetName], the heart of our nation and home of our most treasured and prided institutions... it's also comparatively small and has been devastated by the consequences of the Fall. If we are to stand any chance at uniniting the region, we must expand it so that we can be more sure of its security, productivity and defensability. After all, no measure is too great when it comes to protecting our leaders, the ones who love our people the most!"
generic_reconnecting_the_railways: "Reconnecting the Railways"
generic_reconnecting_the_railways_desc: "In China, they used to say: \"Whoever controls the railroads controls China\". While the majority of factions in what was once Poland do not use a pair of sticks to deliver food into our gaping maws, we could learn a thing or two from that saying, primarily because the PKP railway systems have been utterly decimated. Rail has always (or, well, as long as it has existed) been an elementary facet of army logistics, and reconstructing our damaged infrastructure must be a must! After all, an army marches on its stomach, and that stomach marches on a train full of recovered canned goods."
generic_repairing_the_crucial_roads: "Repairing the Crucial Roads"
generic_repairing_the_crucial_roads_desc: "And just as with the railways, the highways and byways leading around the country have likewise suffered a major punch to the dick. If we want our armies to move around swiftly, we'll need to reconnect these crucial routes, or face remembering why exactly roads were invented: because rolling a wheel or walking on a flat surface is much easier than on a surface which is, for all intents and purpouses and methods of deduction including less than 3 equations not known to the average 4th-grader, not flat."
generic_day_of_victory: "Day of Victory"
generic_day_of_victory_desc: "We have prepared all that we can, fortified every corner, set up every attacking and defending force and accompanied them with support. Our logistics are... at least okay, our soldiers the same, and our support networks have been, to a limited extent, flourishing. It is now time: we must do what is necessary to bring order back to the region, OUR order! So it is time: march out and battle our enemies, brave soldiers!\nAnd hope to whatever (if anything)'s up there it works."
