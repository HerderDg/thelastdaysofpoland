unification.125.t: "[GetNewspaper]Fortress of Kielce unifies the Holy Cross!"
unification.125.desc: "Ziobro may have failed, but his ideals live on, as only one force remains in the Holy Cross voivodeship. Led by a former underling of the General Prosecutor, the fortress of Kielce was initially meant to be merely a means to control the growing unrest within the city. This was nowhere near enough for the ambitions of Dominik Tarczyński, who through shrewd diplomatic and military maneuvering achieved what his former boss couldn't. Finally off his leash, he managed to quell all uprisings against his rule and eventually grew to supplant Ziobro. The further direction of the state remains unclear, as even now rumors of disloyalty persist among the upper echelons of the new government. There is also a question of his devout pro-american bias that may just influence Tarczyński's choices. Only time will tell whether Tarczyński's rule is meant to last."
