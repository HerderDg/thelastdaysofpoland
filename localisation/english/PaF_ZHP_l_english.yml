ZHP_everything_that_ours:0 "Everything That's Ours..."
ZHP_everything_that_ours_desc:0 ""...we'll give to Poland". Not that we have much left, besides courage and patriotism. Surrouded by potential enemies we must call a Great Jamboree in Nadwarciański Gród to decide how the Eternal Summer Action will look like."
ZHP_whats_next:0 "What's Next?"
ZHP_whats_next_desc:0 "Our country stands on a crossroad. The Scout State’s shape is looking clearer and clearer, and now has choices to make that will reflect on it for years if not decades: Choices between the vision of Conservative and Idealist cliques, as they maneuver towards escalating their so far peaceful conflict."
ZHP_our_pride_army:0 "Our Proud Army"
ZHP_our_pride_army_desc:0 "We’re proud of our military, but we are not blinded by our hubris. Loose squads of scouts aren’t a fighting force to unify Poland. If they are to be, we’ll have to devise a cohesive organization that’ll likely sow discord among the Conservative or Idealist circles, depending on our choices."
ZHP_every_child_at_the_service_of_ideals:0 "Every Man in Service of our Ideals"
ZHP_every_child_at_the_service_of_ideals_desc:0 "The so called 'civilian population' is a part of our struggle, whether they want to admit it or not. They live on our territory, are protected by us and if we fall, they'll suffer as well. It is only natural that mass mobilization must ensue and force the complacent populus to taste the life in the army."
ZHP_volunteer_army:0 "Volunteer Army"
ZHP_volunteer_army_desc:0 "We can’t afford to antagonize civilians right now. Threat of hostile invasion will be reason enough for them to take up arms in defense of their homes. By gaining the willing civilian recruits in our armed forces, our ideals will proliferate via sheer proximity."
ZHP_gray_lilys_support_battalions:0 "Gray Lily Auxiliaries"
ZHP_gray_lilys_support_battalions_desc:0 "The Gray Lilies are our best unit. They used to enforce Scout Law among civilians and scouts alike and have garnered quite the reputation. Many Idealist drill instructors think their impeccable conduct and skill will inspire and motivate others, and they are seeking our permission to attach them to their own units."
ZHP_limiting_the_role_of_sl_in_the_army:0 "Curtail the Gray Lilies"
ZHP_limiting_the_role_of_sl_in_the_army_desc:0 "Conservative cliques have argued that we cannot let the military fall prey to political struggles. As a solution, they propose that the Gray Lilies should be kept from expanding, maintaining their exclusivity and keeping them from branching out of their role as secret police."
ZHP_the_tactics_of_our_ancestors:0 "Ancestral Tactics"
ZHP_the_tactics_of_our_ancestors_desc:0 "Just like partisans from a bygone era, a scout is capable of defending a troop’s perimeter with subterfuge and ambushes. Today’s times are no less favorable for irregular warfare than ages long gone. Our high command believes we should continue leveraging this strategy to its fullest and strike uncertainty into our enemies whenever and wherever they dare to step into our territory."
ZHP_changes_of_plans:0 "Change of Plans"
ZHP_changes_of_plans_desc:0 "Irregular warfare suits us on defense, in the right terrain and it requires an inhuman amount of organization. But we have a country to reunify: That means going out of our comfort zone. We’re going to turn a new leaf in terms of our army’s doctrine: To start using more weapon types and to motorize. Rather than lose due to using our ideals as a material weapon, we’re fighting for our ideals, by any means necessary."
ZHP_discovery:0 "It's Free Real Estate"
ZHP_discovery_desc:0 "We just found a pristine bunker from before the collapse, stashed with a big supply of guns, armored vehicles and combat drones. Now the conservatives insist on including all this hardware in our operations right away, whilst the idealists insist on keeping only the small arms, a few miscellaneous supplies and selling the rest. The most zealous of us flaunt the idea of destroying the stashes altogether, condemning them as dishonorable and an anathema to our ways."
ZHP_our_economy:0 "Our Economy"
ZHP_our_economy_desc:0 "As of now the financial matters have had very ad-hoc solutions. This approach lacks any foresight and without a proper plan we end up with chaotic camp lay-outs and a giant waste of our precious materials. We also suffer from unsupervised partisan-like methods of acquiring said resources and the fact our attempts at modernisation can be cut short by a single overzealous Gray Lily official makes this a truly precarious situation. No matter which path we will take, we need to begin establishing transparent economic law, if we are to flourish in the coming years."
ZHP_improvised_workshops:0 "Improvised Workshops"
ZHP_improvised_workshops_desc:0 "Because we don’t rely on any sophisticated hardware, all we need to keep supplies flowing is a few irregular workshops for smelting, assembling and maintaining rifles, making improvised explosives and so on. They can run covertly, regardless of enemy attacks, with their run-down conditions keeping our spirits high and helping us work like one well oiled machine."
ZHP_industrial_camps:0 "Scouting Industrial Camps"
ZHP_industrial_camps_desc:0 "The Idealists think that mere belief in ourselves will save us. But, in order to project these beliefs, we need sheer power. Industrial and even literal electricity. We will take our workshops a step further and organize larger-scale industrial operations supervised by our scouts in order to modernize our economy. No real factories yet… mere camps will do for now."
ZHP_food_searches:0 "Food Tributes"
ZHP_food_searches_desc:0 "We tirelessly protect this region from bandits and raids and yet we don’t ask for much tribute in return: Only “part” of their food to feed us. Aren't we just so merciful?"
ZHP_scout_farm_system:0 "Farming System"
ZHP_scout_farm_system_desc:0 "Our need to feed ourselves is constant: Imports and raids are anything but a constant source of what we so desperately require. We need reliable farming that can feed our denizens at peace and war alike. Naturally, everything will be led by our scout’s foremen."
ZHP_robbery_economy:0 "Robber Economy"
ZHP_robbery_economy_desc:0 "This region is not well-off: Living Standards are pure misery even in the cities. Especially in the cities. The scouting spirit thrives in such circumstances: It lets us acclimate to hardship and live in harmony with pristine nature, with fewer supplies than others. Keeping true to these roots, of course precludes large-scale industry or farming. We’ll look into expanding tributes later: Right now, the best way to remedy our economic shortcomings is to simply organize raider groups and take what we want from our enemies. For the greater good, of course."
ZHP_what_we_will_focus_on:0 "Our Direction"
ZHP_what_we_will_focus_on_desc:0 "The Scout Economic Council has been created and will soon convene for the first time. It’ll be put in charge of deciding the way we will ultimately tackle our economy and production. A Conservative creation, it’ll contain Idealists who already insist production should be limited to small arms and other partisan devices. The founders of the council argue for more measured solutions regarding procuring our resources and to some extent even soldiers. A few radicals will even argue for branching off to create and use real river ships."
ZHP_new_economic_policy:0 "New Economic Policy"
ZHP_new_economic_policy_desc:0 "The economic reforms proposed on the Jamboree proved to have been successful. Our production is booming and each and every Scout is ensured that the true scouting way will prevail."
ZHP_our_society:0 "Our Society"
ZHP_our_society_desc:0 "While the differences between the Idealists and Conservatives are undeniable, both groups agree that the Fall happened, because the morality of Poles has been degrading and rebuilding the polish nation a spiritual course is more than necessary. The main issues that divide the two factions however is as always the scale of our action and whether the civilian population should be forced to emulate the harshest aspect of scout life."
ZHP_prohibition_of_sex:0 "Don't fuck (with me)"
ZHP_prohibition_of_sex_desc:0 "A scout puts the service to his country not just first, but last too: And many thinkers who busy themselves with our laws argue that bodily chastity is no less vital to it than temperance. They believe that a scout must make love to nothing but his or her rifle, and hold no other lover but Poland. The less hardline debaters propose to grant exception and group-assigned partner to those who perform outstanding deeds as a form of incentive to act."
ZHP_scout_law_-_criminal_law:0 "Merge Scout Laws with Penal Laws"
ZHP_scout_law_-_criminal_law_desc:0 "The old decadence has brought our nation to an all time low. The scouting values are the solution that will render Poland eternal, and its safe for the environment as a bonus. We know this. We fight for this. What’s stopping us from making them law? Fear? Or do we still harbor embers of faith in liberal pluralism, even now?\nNo more. The nation will be as close to our moral paragon as possible. The punishments for straying from our path will be severe and public. No one will dare stand against us, within and without."
ZHP_revision_of_the_polish_penal_code:0 "Legal Overhaul"
ZHP_revision_of_the_polish_penal_code_desc:0 "To raise civilian approval, we will give attention to our most attractive ideological talking points. We who are Conservatives will nurture Christian-Polish roots, exalt religious feelings and put the environment first. Our environment is our roots, and thus deserves the same priority as our values."
ZHP_every_child_a_scout:0 "Every Child a Scout"
ZHP_every_child_a_scout_desc:0 "All your kids belong to us. To create a new, stronger nation, we will train the youngest in our ways, so they won’t stray even in their old years. Whatever child we find, will have a term to do in our organization. There shall be no excuses for weakness, dissent and childish rebelliousness within our pristine ranks."
ZHP_voluntary_membership:0 "Voluntary Membership"
ZHP_voluntary_membership_desc:0 "The Idealist's zeal reveals a great flaw: Fear. By going farther than reason commands, idealists reveal that they compensate for their doubts about the robustness of our lifestyle. We who are Conservatives, on the other hand, believe in scouting. Our noble lifestyle needs little coercion to raise recruits, the Fall made sure that we have no shortage of those willing to help defend their friends and loved ones."
ZHP_isolation_of_cities:0 "Isolating Cities"
ZHP_isolation_of_cities_desc:0 "If there is an antithesis to the scouting values, it’s the urban center: Atomized, degenerate societies that pursue comfort, regardless of how detached from nature it is. A few NIMBY regulations and a blockade of their commerce should sever the rural dependency on them, inhibit their growth and shake off their populace into falling into the fruit basket of the Eternal Summer Action, like pears in an orchard."
ZHP_mutual_cooperation:0 "Stronger Together"
ZHP_mutual_cooperation_desc:0 "Where did we go so wrong as to let the disdain for urban centers overwhelm us? Cities are as Polish as the forests and all of us, and they’re just as needed too. We will divide our duties between ourselves, rural civilians and urban denizens, inviting harmony within our regime. When all the cogs of the state work for one common goal, the lifestyle differences will be less a barrier than many imagine."
ZHP_ZHP_Dominant:0 "ZHP Dominant"
ZHP_ZHP_Dominant_desc:0 "Celebrations began among ZHP members as unsurprisingly, the largest faction within our state has managed to assert their dominance over the ZHR and other smaller factions. The Gray Lilies’ subtle influence over our internal politics, their unfaltering loyalty to Scout Law, which they seamlessly passed down onto our Scouts, has assured that the Fleur de Lis will fly high above our forests and bases.\n\n...And above the rubble of cities abandoned, as a reminder of our Nation of Partisans."
ZHP_ZHR_Dominant:0 "ZHR Dominant"
ZHP_ZHR_Dominant_desc:0 "Celebrations have already begun among ZHR members, as the less influential group has managed to assert their dominance over ZHP. Skillful maneuvering in political debates during the Jamborees, crushing the Gray Lilies’ influence in state operations, and refusing to alienate urban centers has garnered ZHR the support it needed to overpower the grasp ZHP held over internal debates. A mass celebrating our success is planned to be held soon.\n\nMay God bless our state built on Traditional Values!"
ZHP_new_social_order:0 "New Social Order"
ZHP_new_social_order_desc:0 "The reforms we implemented will take some time to take root for good, but we are sure that our shining example and new judiciary system will result in a more virtuous society that will not fail Poland again. We cannot afford to repeat our past mistakes."
ZHP_we_are_ready:0 "We Are Ready!"
ZHP_we_are_ready_desc:0 "At the beginning few believed that a state based on scouting values, separated from the seemingly all-important access to the Free City could exist. The wise leadership of our scoutmaster proved adopting a truly scouting way is a superior course of action to anything those within urban circles could ever dream of..."

ZHP_last_touches_desc: "If ten years ago, I'd be told that Polish Scout Organization would be organising an offensive military campaign in the scope of this Voivodeship, I'd laugh my arse off and tell the nerd to stop playing map-painting games for so long. Today, I feel as insecure as the lot of these nerds, as though each of us is stronger than all of them combined. I am doing this for real. Even if life is a simulation, this is still I, planning invasions by what once was an organisation for boys and girls of the nation to learn something and not be weak. I'm going on a journey. A scout out of the forest needs feel no shame. With our Scoutmaster, we enter this new chapter in our existence with confidence in what we achieved so far, but also fear of entering the unknown. But we need feel no shame, come what may come."
ZHP_destroy_coal_lords_desc: "'I will not be afraid of death and bane, till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.' - Macbeth, Act 5 scene 3. But, it's not the forest that's coming. It's her apex predator, her protector and guardian. Our war, the true war, isn't only against the coaliers who vivisect the planet for its treasures as their grandfathers once did. It's against viewing the planet as a meek matter, waiting to be given strength and meaning through sacrifice for fires of industry. The planet, sustains us, even our minds. To live in harmony with them, is to be at your best. So just like how heroes of JRR Tolkien's works marched against evils seeking to pervert Middle-Earth for their own goals, so we march. No ents alongside us: No matter. We've got this."
ZHP_spare_the_elder_desc: "Make no mistake: We have come here to heal the nation. Its soil, its nature, but most importantly its people. This means reconiliation. This means making it clear to the miners who did nothing but despoil the land before, that there is a future for them in our order. A worthy future. Even for the blackest of their souls, the Elder. Such is the power of our healing. We will be together again. In God, with Honor, for Fatherland."
ZHP_execute_the_elder_desc: "Sure, no Balrogs nor dragons will wake from digging deep and greedily. But, by just that, the Elder woke us up. Just like the peoples of Khazad-dûm were never made to dig too deep by anything but their own greed, so did the Elder's total disregard for our ecology came from nothing but deep corruption. This cannot continue. He will be an example for others, to put Poland's fundaments first, its literal soil, as priority. And we will be stronger for it."
ZHP_regroup_desc: "We're fulfilling our destiny. Where once we have ruled the woods we knew like the back of our hand, we've proven we can enter an enemy territory and hold it despite the enemy resistance. It's not always that a partisan force can undertake a succesful full-scale offensive campaign. Or are we still a partisan force? Are we still ZHP, or do we already set out to be something more? Can there be such a thing as something more than ZHP? No matter - We have much more to do. Rest and, as always, we wake at dawn."
ZHP_KRS_war_desc: "It might seem that this will be by far the holiest of our wars. One against an invisible hand that rigs the human behavior to its ideals, compelling it to mow the planet like it's an American's lawn, all for the sake of the invisible Hand, not even for human needs. But deep down we know. This is a heart of the materialist West we're after, that does not even satisfy human needs but modifies them. Materialism, guiding them through technical necessity, that's the heart we're after, not that of 'capitalism', nor that of socialism."
ZHP_KRS_after_war_desc: "Mad science, iron fist rule, secret police, depravities galore. This is not the visage of Stalinist Soviet Union, but that of a corporation, a parasite that siphoned the Polish nature and Polish men and women alike. It seems straightforward: Teach the populace how to unbound themselves from the corporate and bound themselves to the nature again, reverse the excess damage upon the ecosystems. But, we will need all the industry we can get for further wars. The tensions between our cliques flare up again. But our work is not yet done, and there's only so few plants that we can use for war production for our kind of army. In time, we will fully utilize this industry. Until then, we must heal the nature and people alike. For the worst, exile. For the rest, waking up at 4am every morning will go a long way."
ZHP_takedown_the_fantast_desc: "Sensing the senseless fear of our foes, we once again march out, as deadly as Brokilon woods. It's one thing for the salvation of the country to fall down to noble scouting organisation, another to witness a county-wide LARP frolicking around on our country's corpse. We shall prepare the troop and go at them as we have gone at all others: We are the kind of monsters not even witchers can wipe out. The national epic that the Fantast's state is based on might be fair, but it's our duty to wake its denizens from this fantasy. And put them to work. What will they get in exchange? We won't slaughter them like swines. A fair offer if you ask me."
ZHP_lighting_up_the_pyres_desc: "'Death to the whoresons' - was what was grafted upon a sword in the Fantast's writing."
ZHP_ZYD_war_desc: "Widzew club is a senseless thing indeed. In place of seeing reason in the Eternal Summer Action, or at least joining the 'dialogue' screwups, they carved out their own fiefdom in ruins of our land, for no reason. They stand in our way instead of simply existing alongside us, for no reason. And they took some decrepit political commentator or journalist or whoever, whose only achievement i remember was sitting in a talkshow in a cardinal's costume saying 'I for one have it up my arse', worshipping him like the four letters he worships for no reason, all because they've acquired a radical Judeophilie attitude, you guessed it, FOR NO REASON. At least we need no reason to march at them other than that they stand in our way."
ZHP_ZYD_after_war_desc: "The jew-worship of the hooligans has proven even more senseless than we thought: Their leader, Jerzy Urban, is one foot in the grave, and the only action that made sense was letting him live out his days in peace. We will make it clear that there's nothing special about the Jews: We might let them live among us, we might even protect them as Casimir III has: But we will never let anyone but the ones who are truly us, rule us. Yes, New Testament is still the best, at the heart of Poland."
ZHP_WML_war_desc: "All the talk about dialogue and unity within this city was for naught, is for naught, will be for naught. For one simple reason. No one retains sanity, sequestered within a concrete jungle, especially one that for obvious reasons lost its maintenence privileges and bears its true nature bare. You may as well try forge a dialogue inside a volcano. The fires of this place consume the souls of all who enter: It is our duty to march in, and help the city's denizens reclaim their souls. Once we plant our flag on their town hall: Then we can discuss things."
ZHP_the_cracks_are_showing_desc: "Moving onward, things won't get easier: We knew this. Where once we had to deal with a few townsfolk and manage forests we knew, now we have taken this entire Voivodeship. A fate of manifold towns, resources and forests lie in our hands. Challenges from foes stronger than any we've faced before, lie ahead. Myriad issues split us: And, busy with integrating the lands and scaling up our leadership and rule, we're less and less able to keep our values and vision unitary. The recruitment of new scouts, the new resource operations, all were hijacked by factions for their own gain. There is much to be done... and if we can't keep the factions together, there will be even more to do."

zhp.1.t:0 "Calls for a Jamboree"
zhp.1.desc:0 "It's 4:30 in the morning. The entire Warta Fortress is shrouded in complete darkness, the only exception being the High Assistant's room. Its owner - Tomasz Ziętek sits at his desk, pouring over disastrous reports, with the dim light of a kerosene lamp as his only companion. This whole scouting thing is a mess, with next to no top to bottom directives, which means that all aspects of the state are one big free-for-all depending on what the minor officers could improvise. Ziętek knows that he has to think of something or he'll be at best banished. He may be the avatar of 'Rudy', but that doesn't mean he's irreplaceable. He's only an actor and if the scouts are diligent enough they can find another person to fill the role of the spiritual successor of the long dead WW2 hero. It's all for show anyways. Who knows, maybe those maniacs from Gray Lily will want to reenact 'Operation Arsenal' in a 'realistic' manner as some sort of gruesome ritual. It's no use getting caught up in that now.\n\nThe thing is, he'd already figured something out, if only Scoutmaster Duda hadn't been so unwilling to sign any documents introducing the reforms. As opposed to Ziętek, Duda's unmoveable as he is one of the most legitimate leaders in post-Fall Poland. The High Assistant is just about to give up, when he notices that under the pile of other documents, there is a letter with a green emblem depicting a crocodile - the symbol of his most trusted men. Why is it there? He made sure to tell the couriers that those are to be delivered separately due to their importance. He quickly opened the envelope and couldn't believe his eyes.\n\n'Jan, you magnificent bastard' - Tomasz thought.\n\nTurns out his most competent man - Jan Kolbuszowski, found the former president's wife and daughter are hiding in one of the hidden self-sufficient government bunkers.\n\nFinally some leverage to force this oaf of a Scoutmaster to comply. Ziętek smiled and quickly wrote a letter with some indirect threats attached to a pre-prepared proclamation of the 2027 Jamboree written by Ziętek himself, ready to be signed by Duda.\nThings are finally looking up."
zhp.1.a:0 "Damn those couriers!"  

zhp.2.t:0 "The Deliberations begin"
zhp.2.desc:0 "'Order! Order!' - the voice of troop leader Orsza was booming in the open fields near the Fortress.\nHe still couldn't believe Rudy finally got the Scoutmaster to call the Jamboree. Now that all of the representatives are here, it's Orsza's job to make them see reason and try to achieve a partial compromise. It won't be easy. The overzealous Idealists will try to sway other groups to their outlandish ideals, while being hampered by the ZHR and verbally attacked by 'Zawisza'. And the creeps from the Gray Lily will just stare eerily… Better that than having them step in…"
zhp.2.a:0 "My dear companions, it's time to talk." 

zhp.3.t:0 "The Conservative's Plan"
zhp.3.desc:0 "- So - 'Orsza' began - we've concluded that the methods proposed by the ZHR representatives will be the backbone of our future prosperity. Before we're done with the issue of the economy, we need to address what our future potential will be focused on.\n\nThe ZHP members gave each others knowing looks.\n\n- The army - their leader exclaimed - we've already wasted the capabilities of our population on indulgence and indolence instead of following the Partisans' Way. The least we can do is use the ZHR’s methods to bolster our soldiers.\n- Objection - the voice of the ZHR leader was harsh and determined - The question of the military is dealt with in another line of voting. We recognize the importance of taking care of the army, but we cannot overlook the fact that it cannot function without a strong civilian economy.\n- If it were up to me, you'd be detained for sabotaging the military! -\n\nThe chaotic argument erupted once more.\n\n - I can't believe these guys - Orsza whispered disenhearted. Then he gave a long look to the High Quartermaster sitting next to him - What would be your suggestion, companion Zośka?\nSince no faction would bring this up anytime soon, I would suggest we focus on infrastructure and logistics as a compromise. -"

Today, however, the population of Łódź breathed a sigh of relief, welcoming a familiar sight in the region's capital. \n\nEver since their inception in 1910, various Polish Scout movements fought for the Polish state - be it in the uprisings at the end of WW1 or in the Warsaw uprising during WW2, and they continue to do so to this day, having just kicked out the last hostile clique out of Łódź. Andrzej Duda, who assumed the role of the Scoutmaster of the Autonomous Troop of ZHP thanks to his previous ties within the group, has declared his intentions of creating a civil government and returning the rule of law to the region. However, given the idealism of some in the ZHP, as well as the Banner's domain's decentralized structure, we predict it's gonna take a while before a real state apparatus starts evolving on Łodz’s soil."

Without the next step our economic ideas will not give the most efficient  results\n - As if they could give any results at all.\n\nThe chaotic argument erupted once more.\n\nI can't believe these guys - Orsza whispered disenhearted. Then he gave a long look to the High Quartermaster sitting next to him - What would be your suggestion, companion Zośka? -\n- Since no faction would bring this up anytime soon, I would suggest we focus on infrastructure and logistics as a compromise. -"

They have the most faith in us, so we tap their zeal. Soon enough I didn’t even mind. He led by example. A dispassionate example, methodical, efficient. He was presented as the epitome of scouting values, and whatever he did, it was our ambition to do it like him. Hunt prey like him. Butcher and skin it with the same dispassion that he had, even as many of us were squeamish about the dirty work of skinning a fresh animal. His mere gaze was enough to replace it with fear, and force us to learn. \n\nStraying is inevitable. Someone, somewhere, will always be the weakest link. \n\nStory as old as humankind. Some fair-eyed maid steals a man’s eye, gets the notion where none belong. It’s like trying to enfore a ban on sex, all that leads to is some diligently following it and all the others to somehow try to breach it. I begin to understand it now, possibly - The goal must be to find such contrarians and weed them out. That and those who are too weak to be useful to us..\n\nLike Adam from our squad. A weak scout in the commander’s eyes, which meant he was competent and not much more. I hear the summons and there he is, shoved into the sleeping bag by the commander. Another bag was wiggling madly, presumably containing a pretty-fair maid that stole the boy’s heart. I knew what would follow. Normally we’d move to the nearest lake: but this was happening at a lake. It’s like they never saw Friday the 13th: Else surely they’d know better than to date around the lakes. After all, Jason has nothing on Grey Lilies. \n\nIt’s one thing to hear what happens to fornicators, it’s another to experience it: Quickly I imagined them sinking in sleeping bags, tied to rocks. It’d be claustrophobic and… at least they weren’t being burned alive in them. But my mind already rendered my face pale. I almost jumped when the commander saw me like this. - Got something to say? - he asked, watching me with a mute expression."

'The Grey Lilies will doom us', 'This type of sedition destroyed Poland in the first place'. As if who's in charge would somehow change the mud we have to trudge through.\nThe discussion ended abruptly, when one of the scouts he sent as the vanguard returned with the news about a hidden government bunker full of weapons.\n- It's quite a find, don't you think, companion? - asked the young scout.\n- Indeed, it is - replied Kolbuszowski - Doesn't change the fact they could've sent us after this massive rainstorm has passed. - he added in his thoughts - Let's get a closer look.\nIt turned out the bunker was full of relatively new rifles, grenade launchers and even drones and armed vehicles. Not so compatible with the orthodox scouting way.\n- I've got to send a letter to command about this.\nHe could already hear various factions arguing, saying things like..."

I’m saying he should. -\n\nHe was busy hooking the sleeping bags up to their respective rocks. I had very little time.\n\n- Adam’s guilty, of course, but there is a better way of punishing him. Back in Ancient Rome, the soldiers guilty of an offense would draw lots. Each tenth man would have to be killed by his fellow soldiers… -\n\nMy whispers saved the boy’s life, for he ordered one bag to be detached from the rock. Out went the boy, like a larva from its cocoon. But the girl wasn’t as lucky as he was. The Lily stood before the penitent, making him first look him in the eye. And offered him something he never offered anyone as long as he served: Mercy. Provided of course the boy… burns the bridge that led him astray. \n\n*BLAM*\n\nHe spoke nothing this day, or the next. He set up his shelter later on that day with mute, methodical precision, walked and washed like a zombie. But as a scout, he performed well. That’s all that the Lily cared about. Soon enough I had his ear.\n\nIf I objected, I’d die with them. If I did nothing, they’d both die. But I had a solution. Not to spare them, but to do what I do: Make lemonade. It was the right thing to do, this I know for certain. It meant one person marked for death would be spared. I saved a life today. And gave the Scouts a well-drilled comrade. One with a certain… robust obedience\n\nChanging the world is not a way to survive. But surviving is what I do."

It's just sugar! - the trader couldn't believe his ears.\n- I don't have time for this. Pack up or your cargo will be confiscated -\nThen he saluted Rudy's convoy and ordered his men to open the second gate destined for the officials.\nThey passed the truck without seeing how the situation would conclude.\n- This merchant better stop acting up or he won't be trading anything at all - Rudy thought.\n\nWhen they finally drove past the gate, Rudy saw the whole complex was renovated to train a new wave of conscripted children. Our recruiters started to search for strong and smart children from the age of 3 and conscript them into our new system. The willingness of their parents is not necessary, yet still they are often enthusiastic about the prospect as the Scout’s training ensures security and food for their offspring.\nI wish the littlest ones had time for their childhood, however we don't choose the reality we live in.

I had to volunteer for the special operation. We heard something was fishy about Krośniewice, but we never expected this much horror. Famished people fed only with grass to see how long will they last, giant people-eating fly traps and manure made from the local politicians that disappeared after some statements criticising the Consortium. And those were the medics mind you. Really makes you see the reason of relying on the natural medicine. What's interesting is that they weren’t rying to destroy their documents with the results of their 'research'. Hoping we would make use of it maybe. But we burned all those unholy papers along with their bodies. We tried to help their victims. Feeding them flour after months of malnourishment, so their guts adjust before the real food comes up. Some of them may even prove to be good scouts in the future. Those, who were too deformed by the experiments were supposed to be put down. I intervened. Again. Said letting them live and spread the stories will prove to the wider population that our war agianst the Consortium and our cause are just. How can they not be, when the alternative looks like that.

The Consortium was one the most reputable factions in the voivodeship besides the Łódź itself and it proved to be co-run by the complete monsters.

Or is it the fault of those who didn't pay respect to those who served their homeland in the past? \n§7Well, as it turns out, there is a group matching all those descriptions:§! the CITY DWELLERS - the liberal-minded, craven and non-patriotic bourgeoisie who drove the Polish village folk into irrelevancy and then started rebelling once a rural population-friendly party came to power. \n\nWe have to ensure that through our war of reconquest, the urban population will fail to regain their past political power and influence in Polish media and culture. §tThere is, however, an internal split between the Scouts on how our joint government achieves this end.§! The §2ZHR§! proposes a less painful approach of empowering the ruralities, milking the funds and technology off of city dwellers and making it easier for them to peacefully settle in the countryside, where they will get used to more proper values. \n\nThe §gGray Lilies§! see this as mere hand-waving. \nIn their vision, an ideal Poland would be one completely devoid of urban influence - one *devoid of cities themselves*. As such - according to them - any large towns and cities are not to be just depopulated and deurbanized, but fully demolished (and preferably razed to the ground) so that the space occupied by them can be reforested and repurposed to serve Poland and those who are ready to defend her, and so that the city dwellers will once and for all abandon their degenerate, comfortable lifestyles and their urbanite bullshit will be forever done and dealt with.\n\n\n"

ZHP_city_sprawl_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts the urbanization in our Voivodeship relentlessly swells and grows like a putrid tumor, much to the disgruntlement spreading within our ranks. If we can't stop this illness, our soldiers will lose hope in the success of our Troop."

ZHP_deurbanization_building_desc:0 "As our population grows in size due to rising birth rates and migration, our cities begin to sprawl. It is most unfortunate that our fellow Poles decided to contribute to city sprawl instead of noble countryside or forest living... We can stop that by reintroducing zoning laws and spatial planning as an excuse for forbidding the raising of new districts."

ZHP_deurbanization_low_emission_desc:0 "Whether we like it or not, the presence of urban centers is unavoidable (at least for now). As such we have to make them as friendly to the natural environment as possible. As such, we plan to survey our territory in search of sources of vile carbon emissions and put them down... with taxes."

Mass produced, shoddy products may just be one of the most repulsive forms of bile it spews out into the world. In that regard, we’ve made the decision to make sure such items are as unappealing as possible, by skyrocketing their prices to the point that they get pushed out of the market by good old countryside alternatives."
