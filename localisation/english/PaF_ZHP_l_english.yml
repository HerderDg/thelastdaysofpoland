ZHP_everything_that_ours:0 "Everything That's Ours"
ZHP_everything_that_ours_desc:0 ""
ZHP_whats_next:0 "What's Next?"
ZHP_whats_next_desc:0 "Our country stands on the crossroads. The Scouting State’s shape is looking clearer and clearer, and now will have choices to make that will reflect on it for years if not decades: Choices between the vision of Conservative and Idealist cliques, as they maneuver towards escalating their so far peaceful conflict."
ZHP_our_pride_army:0 "Our Proud Army"
ZHP_our_pride_army_desc:0 "We’re proud of our military: Not blind. Loose squads of scouts aren’t a fighting force to unify Poland. If they are to be, we’ll have to devise a cohesive organization that’ll likely sow discord among Conservative or Idealist circles, depending on our choices."
ZHP_every_child_at_the_service_of_ideals:0 "Every Child in the Service of Ideals"
ZHP_every_child_at_the_service_of_ideals_desc:0 "Polish scouting runs on the belief that a child is not nearly as hapless as adults presume. Our commanders will work on including that principle in our army: Surely rendering the parents ecstatic as their children take an active role in the cause."
ZHP_volunteer_army:0 "Volunteer Army"
ZHP_volunteer_army_desc:0 "We can’t afford to antagonize civilians right now. Threat of hostile invasion will suffice for them to take up arms in defence of their homes. By gaining the willing civilian recruits in our armed forces, our ideals will proliferate via sheer proximity."
ZHP_gray_lilys_support_battalions:0 "Gray Lily Auxilia"
ZHP_gray_lilys_support_battalions_desc:0 "The Gray Lilies are our best unit. It used to enforce the Scout Law among civilians and scouts alike. Many Idealist drill instructors think their impeccable conduct and skill will inspire and motivate others, and so seek to attach them to their own units."
ZHP_limiting_the_role_of_sl_in_the_army:0 "Curtay the Gray Lilies"
ZHP_limiting_the_role_of_sl_in_the_army_desc:0 "Conservative cliques have argued that we cannot let the military fall prey to political struggles. For that, they propose to keep Gray Lilies from expanding, maintaining their exclusivity and keeping them from branching out of their role as secret police."
ZHP_the_tactics_of_our_ancestors:0 "Ancestral Tactics"
ZHP_the_tactics_of_our_ancestors_desc:0 "Just like partisans from bygone era, a scout is capable of defending a troop’s perimeter with subterfuge and ambushes. Today’s times are no less favorable for irregular warfare than ages long gone. Our high command believes we should continue leveraging this strategy to its fullest."
ZHP_changes_of_plans:0 "Change of Plans"
ZHP_changes_of_plans_desc:0 "Irregular warfare suits us on defense, in the right terrain. But we have a country to reunify: That means going out of our comfort zone. We’re going to turn a new leaf in our army doctrine: To start using more weapon types and to motorize. Rather than lose due to using our ideals as a material weapon, we’re fighting for our ideals, by any means necessary."
ZHP_discovery:0 "It's Free Real Estate"
ZHP_discovery_desc:0 "We just found a pristine bunker from before the collapse, stashing a big supply of guns, armored vehicles and combat drones. Now the conservatives insist on including all this hardware in our operations right away, whilst idealists insist on keeping only small arms, few supplies and selling the rest. The most zealous of us float an idea of destroying the stashes, condemning them as dishonorable."
ZHP_our_economy:0 "Our Economy"
ZHP_our_economy_desc:0 ""
ZHP_improvised_workshops:0 "Improvised Workshops"
ZHP_improvised_workshops_desc:0 "Because we don’t rely on sophisticated hardware, all we need to keep supplies is a few irregular workshops for smelting, rifle assembly, improvised explosives and so on. They can run covertly, regardless of enemy attacks, with their run-down conditions keeping our spirits well-oiled."
ZHP_industrial_camps:0 "Scouting Industrial Camps"
ZHP_industrial_camps_desc:0 "The Idealists think that mere belief in ourselves will save us. But, in order to project these beliefs, we need sheer power. Industrial, even literal electricity. We will step up from our workshops and make larger-scale industrial operations supervised by our scouts to modernize our economy. No real factories yet… mere camps will do."
ZHP_food_searches:0 "Food Tributes"
ZHP_food_searches_desc:0 "We protect this region from bandits and raids. And yet we don’t ask for much in tribute: Only “part” of their food to feed us. Aren't we merciful?"
ZHP_scout_farm_system:0 "Farming System"
ZHP_scout_farm_system_desc:0 "Our need to feed ourselves is constant: Imports and raids are anything but a constant source. We need reliable farming that can feed our denizens at peace and war alike. Naturally, everything will be led by our scout foremen."
ZHP_robbery_economy:0 "Robber Economy"
ZHP_robbery_economy_desc:0 "The region is not well-off: Standard of living is pure misery even in cites. Especially in cities. The scouting spirit thrives in such circumstances: It lets us acclimate to hardship and live in harmony with pristine nature, with fewer supplies than others. Keeping true to these roots, of course, precludes large-scale industry or farming. We’ll look into expanding tributes later: Right now, the best way to remedy our economic shortcomings is to simply organize raider groups and take what we want from our enemies."
ZHP_what_we_will_focus_on:0 "Our Direction"
ZHP_what_we_will_focus_on_desc:0 "The Scout Economic Council has been created and will soon start convening. It’ll have to choose the way we will ultimately tackle our economy and production. A Conservative creation, it’ll contain Idealists who already insist production should be limited to small arms and other partisan devices. The founders of the council argue for more measured solutions regarding food and civilian procurement. A few radicals will even argue for branching off to creating and using real river ships."
ZHP_new_economic_policy:0 "New Economic Policy"

ZHP_our_society:0 "Our Society"
ZHP_our_society_desc:0 ""
ZHP_prohibition_of_sex:0 "Don't fuck (with me)"
ZHP_prohibition_of_sex_desc:0 "A scout puts the service to his country not just first, but last too: And many thinkers who busy themselves with our laws argue that bodily chastity is no less vital to it than temperance. They believe that a scout must make love to nothing but his or her rifle, and hold no lover but Poland. The less hardline debaters propose to grant exception and group-assigned partner to those who perform outstanding deeds"
ZHP_scout_law_-_criminal_law:0 "Merge Scout Laws with Penal Laws"
ZHP_scout_law_-_criminal_law_desc:0 "The old decadence has brought our nation low. The scouting values are the solution that will render Poland eternal, and its ecology safe. We know this. We fight for this. What’s stopping us from making them law? Fear? Or do we still harbor embers of faith in liberal pluralism, even now?\nNo more. The nation will be as close to our moral paragon as possible. The punishments for straying from our path will be severe and public."
ZHP_revision_of_the_polish_penal_code:0 "Legal Overhaul"
ZHP_revision_of_the_polish_penal_code_desc:0 "To raise civilian approval, we will give attention to our most attractive ideological talking points. We who are Conservatives will nurture Christian-Polish roots, exalt religious feelings and put the environment first. Our environment is our roots, and thus deserves the same priority as our values."
ZHP_every_child_a_scout:0 "Every Child a Scout"
ZHP_every_child_a_scout_desc:0 "All your kids belong to us. To create a new, stronger nation, we will train the youngest in our ways, so they won’t stray even in their old years. Whichever child we find, will have a term to do in our organization."
ZHP_voluntary_membership:0 "Voluntary Membership"
ZHP_voluntary_membership_desc:0 "The Idealist zeal reveals a great flaw: Fear. By going farther than reason commands, idealists reveal that they compensate for their doubts about the robustness of our lifestyle. We who are Conservatives, on the other hand, believe in scouting. Our noble lifestyle needs little coercion to raise recruits."
ZHP_isolation_of_cities:0 "Isolating Cities"
ZHP_isolation_of_cities_desc:0 "If there is an antithesis to the scouting values, it’s the urban center: Atomized, degenerate societies that pursue comfort, regardless of how detached from nature it is. A few NIMBY regulations and blockade of their commerce should sever the rural dependency on them, inhibit their growth and shake off their populace into joining the Eternal Summer Action, like pears in the orchard."
ZHP_mutual_cooperation:0 "Stronger Together"
ZHP_mutual_cooperation_desc:0 "Where did we go so wrong as to let the disdain for urban centers overwhelm us? Cities are as much Poland as us, and just as needed too. We will divide our duties between ourselves, rural civilians and urban denizens, inviting harmony into our regime. When all the cogs of the state work for one common goal, the lifestyle differences will be less a barrier than many imagine."

POLITICS_ANDRZEJ_DUDA_DESC:0 "Andrzej Duda (born 16 May 1972) - Polish lawyer and politician who has served as President of Poland since 2015. Prior to assuming the presidency, he was elected to the Sejm from 2011 to 2014 and European Parliament from 2014 until 2015. President of Poland from 2015 to 2025. During the final years of his presidency, he continued to lose agency over his actions, becoming more and more subservient to the will of the head of PiS - Jarosław Kaczyński. When Kaczyński was gone and Poland collapsed Duda, who already served his two terms, was deemed unimportant by the remains of the political establishment. With no political allies he had to search for a safe haven. He eventually joined forces with ZHR to which he had once belonged to. While ZHR planned to restore Duda as the rightful president of Poland, their overzealous compatriots - the idealists form ZHP decided to turn Duda once again into a puppet and a head of their state in name only, using him as a legitimizing factor in their future conquest of Poland."
POLITICS_MAREK_JEDRASZEWSKI_DESC:0 "Marek Jędraszewski (born 24 July 1949) is a Polish Roman Catholic prelate who has been Archbishop of Kraków since 8 December 2016. He served as the Archbishop of Łódź from 2012 to 2017. He has also been Vice-President of the Polish Episcopal Conference since 2014. His selection for the Kraków archdiocese was perceived as a surprise in some quarters. After the upheaval typical to the collapsing sociaty Jędraszewski was cast out from Krakow by the liberal population of the city because of his staunchly traditionalist and controversial rethoric. He returned to Łódź and helped local catholic boy scouts to organize opposition to the maniacal rule of ZHP."
