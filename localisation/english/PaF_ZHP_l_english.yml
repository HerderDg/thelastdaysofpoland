ZHP_everything_that_ours:0 "Everything That's Ours..."
ZHP_everything_that_ours_desc:0 ""...we'll give to Poland". Not that we have much left, besides courage and patriotism. Surrouded by potential enemies we must call a Great Jamboree in Nadwarciański Gród to decide how the Eternal Summer Action will look like."
ZHP_whats_next:0 "What's Next?"
ZHP_whats_next_desc:0 "Our country stands on a crossroad. The Scout State’s shape is looking clearer and clearer, and now has choices to make that will reflect on it for years if not decades: Choices between the vision of Conservative and Idealist cliques, as they maneuver towards escalating their so far peaceful conflict."
ZHP_our_pride_army:0 "Our Proud Army"
ZHP_our_pride_army_desc:0 "We’re proud of our military, but we are not blinded by our hubris. Loose squads of scouts aren’t a fighting force to unify Poland. If they are to be, we’ll have to devise a cohesive organization that’ll likely sow discord among the Conservative or Idealist circles, depending on our choices."
ZHP_every_child_at_the_service_of_ideals:0 "Every Child in Service of our Ideals"
ZHP_every_child_at_the_service_of_ideals_desc:0 "Polish scouting runs on the belief that a child is not nearly as hapless as adults presume. Our commanders will work on including that principle in our army aswell: Surely rendering the parents ecstatic as their children take an active role in our cause."
ZHP_volunteer_army:0 "Volunteer Army"
ZHP_volunteer_army_desc:0 "We can’t afford to antagonize civilians right now. Threat of hostile invasion will be reason enough for them to take up arms in defense of their homes. By gaining the willing civilian recruits in our armed forces, our ideals will proliferate via sheer proximity."
ZHP_gray_lilys_support_battalions:0 "Gray Lily Auxiliaries"
ZHP_gray_lilys_support_battalions_desc:0 "The Gray Lilies are our best unit. They used to enforce Scout Law among civilians and scouts alike and have garnered quite the reputation. Many Idealist drill instructors think their impeccable conduct and skill will inspire and motivate others, and they are seeking our permission to attach them to their own units."
ZHP_limiting_the_role_of_sl_in_the_army:0 "Curtail the Gray Lilies"
ZHP_limiting_the_role_of_sl_in_the_army_desc:0 "Conservative cliques have argued that we cannot let the military fall prey to political struggles. As a solution, they propose that the Gray Lilies should be kept from expanding, maintaining their exclusivity and keeping them from branching out of their role as secret police."
ZHP_the_tactics_of_our_ancestors:0 "Ancestral Tactics"
ZHP_the_tactics_of_our_ancestors_desc:0 "Just like partisans from a bygone era, a scout is capable of defending a troop’s perimeter with subterfuge and ambushes. Today’s times are no less favorable for irregular warfare than ages long gone. Our high command believes we should continue leveraging this strategy to its fullest and strike uncertainty into our enemies whenever and wherever they dare to step into our territory."
ZHP_changes_of_plans:0 "Change of Plans"
ZHP_changes_of_plans_desc:0 "Irregular warfare suits us on defense, in the right terrain and it requires an inhuman amount of organization. But we have a country to reunify: That means going out of our comfort zone. We’re going to turn a new leaf in terms of our army’s doctrine: To start using more weapon types and to motorize. Rather than lose due to using our ideals as a material weapon, we’re fighting for our ideals, by any means necessary."
ZHP_discovery:0 "It's Free Real Estate"
ZHP_discovery_desc:0 "We just found a pristine bunker from before the collapse, stashed with a big supply of guns, armored vehicles and combat drones. Now the conservatives insist on including all this hardware in our operations right away, whilst the idealists insist on keeping only the small arms, a few miscellaneous supplies and selling the rest. The most zealous of us flaunt the idea of destroying the stashes altogether, condemning them as dishonorable and an anathema to our ways."
ZHP_our_economy:0 "Our Economy"
ZHP_our_economy_desc:0 "As of now the financial matters have had very ad-hoc solutions. This approach lacks any foresight and without a proper plan we end up with chaotic camp lay-outs and a giant waste of our precious materials. We also suffer from unsupervised partisan-like methods of acquiring said resources and the fact our attempts at modernisation can be cut short by a single overzealous Gray Lily official makes this a truly precarious situation. No matter which path we will take, we need to begin establishing transparent economic law, if we are to flourish in the coming years."
ZHP_improvised_workshops:0 "Improvised Workshops"
ZHP_improvised_workshops_desc:0 "Because we don’t rely on any sophisticated hardware, all we need to keep supplies flowing is a few irregular workshops for smelting, assembling and maintaining rifles, making improvised explosives and so on. They can run covertly, regardless of enemy attacks, with their run-down conditions keeping our spirits high and helping us work like one well oiled machine."
ZHP_industrial_camps:0 "Scouting Industrial Camps"
ZHP_industrial_camps_desc:0 "The Idealists think that mere belief in ourselves will save us. But, in order to project these beliefs, we need sheer power. Industrial and even literal electricity. We will take our workshops a step further and organize larger-scale industrial operations supervised by our scouts in order to modernize our economy. No real factories yet… mere camps will do for now."
ZHP_food_searches:0 "Food Tributes"
ZHP_food_searches_desc:0 "We tirelessly protect this region from bandits and raids and yet we don’t ask for much tribute in return: Only “part” of their food to feed us. Aren't we just so merciful?"
ZHP_scout_farm_system:0 "Farming System"
ZHP_scout_farm_system_desc:0 "Our need to feed ourselves is constant: Imports and raids are nothing but a constant source of what we so desperately require. We need reliable farming that can feed our denizens at peace and war alike. Naturally, everything will be led by our scout’s foremen."
ZHP_robbery_economy:0 "Robber Economy"
ZHP_robbery_economy_desc:0 "This region is not well-off: Living Standards are pure misery even in the cities. Especially in the cities. The scouting spirit thrives in such circumstances: It lets us acclimate to hardship and live in harmony with pristine nature, with fewer supplies than others. Keeping true to these roots, of course precludes large-scale industry or farming. We’ll look into expanding tributes later: Right now, the best way to remedy our economic shortcomings is to simply organize raider groups and take what we want from our enemies. For the greater good, of course."
ZHP_what_we_will_focus_on:0 "Our Direction"
ZHP_what_we_will_focus_on_desc:0 "The Scout Economic Council has been created and will soon convene for the first time. It’ll be put in charge of deciding the way we will ultimately tackle our economy and production. A Conservative creation, it’ll contain Idealists who already insist production should be limited to small arms and other partisan devices. The founders of the council argue for more measured solutions regarding procuring our resources and to some extent even soldiers. A few radicals will even argue for branching off to create and use real river ships."
ZHP_new_economic_policy:0 "New Economic Policy"
ZHP_new_economic_policy_desc:0 "The economic reforms proposed on the Jamboree proved to have been successful. Our production is booming and each and every Scout is ensured that the true scouting way will prevail."
ZHP_our_society:0 "Our Society"
ZHP_our_society_desc:0 "While the differences between the Idealists and Conservatives are undeniable, both groups agree that the Fall happened, because the morality of Poles has been degrading and rebuilding the polish nation a spiritual course is more than necessary. The main issues that divide the two factions however is as always the scale of our action and whether the civilian population should be forced to emulate the harshest aspect of scout life."
ZHP_prohibition_of_sex:0 "Don't fuck (with me)"
ZHP_prohibition_of_sex_desc:0 "A scout puts the service to his country not just first, but last too: And many thinkers who busy themselves with our laws argue that bodily chastity is no less vital to it than temperance. They believe that a scout must make love to nothing but his or her rifle, and hold no other lover but Poland. The less hardline debaters propose to grant exception and group-assigned partner to those who perform outstanding deeds as a form of incentive to act."
ZHP_scout_law_-_criminal_law:0 "Merge Scout Laws with Penal Laws"
ZHP_scout_law_-_criminal_law_desc:0 "The old decadence has brought our nation to an all time low. The scouting values are the solution that will render Poland eternal, and its safe for the environment as a bonus. We know this. We fight for this. What’s stopping us from making them law? Fear? Or do we still harbor embers of faith in liberal pluralism, even now?\nNo more. The nation will be as close to our moral paragon as possible. The punishments for straying from our path will be severe and public. No one will dare stand against us, within and without."
ZHP_revision_of_the_polish_penal_code:0 "Legal Overhaul"
ZHP_revision_of_the_polish_penal_code_desc:0 "To raise civilian approval, we will give attention to our most attractive ideological talking points. We who are Conservatives will nurture Christian-Polish roots, exalt religious feelings and put the environment first. Our environment is our roots, and thus deserves the same priority as our values."
ZHP_every_child_a_scout:0 "Every Child a Scout"
ZHP_every_child_a_scout_desc:0 "All your kids belong to us. To create a new, stronger nation, we will train the youngest in our ways, so they won’t stray even in their old years. Whatever child we find, will have a term to do in our organization. There shall be no excuses for weakness, dissent and childish rebelliousness within our pristine ranks."
ZHP_voluntary_membership:0 "Voluntary Membership"
ZHP_voluntary_membership_desc:0 "The Idealist's zeal reveals a great flaw: Fear. By going farther than reason commands, idealists reveal that they compensate for their doubts about the robustness of our lifestyle. We who are Conservatives, on the other hand, believe in scouting. Our noble lifestyle needs little coercion to raise recruits, the Fall made sure that we have no shortage of those willing to help defend their friends and loved ones."
ZHP_isolation_of_cities:0 "Isolating Cities"
ZHP_isolation_of_cities_desc:0 "If there is an antithesis to the scouting values, it’s the urban center: Atomized, degenerate societies that pursue comfort, regardless of how detached from nature it is. A few NIMBY regulations and a blockade of their commerce should sever the rural dependency on them, inhibit their growth and shake off their populace into falling into the fruit basket of the Eternal Summer Action, like pears in an orchard."
ZHP_mutual_cooperation:0 "Stronger Together"
ZHP_mutual_cooperation_desc:0 "Where did we go so wrong as to let the disdain for urban centers overwhelm us? Cities are as Polish as the forests and all of us, and they’re just as needed too. We will divide our duties between ourselves, rural civilians and urban denizens, inviting harmony within our regime. When all the cogs of the state work for one common goal, the lifestyle differences will be less a barrier than many imagine."
ZHP_new_social_order:0 "New Social Order"
ZHP_new_social_order_desc:0 "The reforms we implemented will take some time to take root for good, but we are sure that our shining example and new judiciary system will result in a more virtuous society that will not fail Poland again. We cannot afford to repeat our past mistakes."
ZHP_we_are_ready:0 "We Are Ready!"
ZHP_we_are_ready_desc:0 "At the beginning few believed that a state based on scouting values, separated from the seemingly all-important access to the Free City could exist. The wise leadership of our scoutmaster proved adopting a truly scouting way is a superior course of action to anything those within urban circles could ever dream of..."

zhp.1.t:0 "Calls for a Jamboree"
zhp.1.desc:0 "It's 4:30 in the morning. The entire Warta Fortress is shrouded in complete darkness, the only exception being the High Assistant's room. Its owner - Tomasz Ziętek sits at his desk, pouring over disastrous reports, with the dim light of a kerosene lamp as his only companion. This whole scouting thing is a mess, with next to no top to bottom directives, which means that all aspects of the state are one big free-for-all depending on what the minor officers could improvise. Ziętek knows that he has to think of something or he'll be at best banished. He may be the avatar of 'Rudy', but that doesn't mean he's irreplaceable. He's only an actor and if the scouts are diligent enough they can find another person to fill the role of the spiritual successor of the long dead WW2 hero. It's all for show anyways. Who knows, maybe those maniacs from Gray Lily will want to reenact 'Operation Arsenal' in a 'realistic' manner as some sort of gruesome ritual. It's no use getting caught up in that now.\n\nThe thing is, he'd already figured something out, if only Scoutmaster Duda hadn't been so unwilling to sign any documents introducing the reforms. As opposed to Ziętek, Duda's unmoveable as he is one of the most legitimate leaders in post-Fall Poland. The High Assistant is just about to give up, when he notices that under the pile of other documents, there is a letter with a green emblem depicting a crocodile - the symbol of his most trusted men. Why is it there? He made sure to tell the runners that those are to be delivered separately due to their importance. He quickly opened the envelope and couldn't believe his eyes.\n\n'Jan, you magnificent bastard' - Tomasz thought.\n\nTurns out his most competent man - Jan Kolbuszowski, found the former president's wife and daughter are hiding in one of the hidden self-sufficient government bunkers.\n\nFinally some leverage to force this oaf of a Scoutmaster to comply. Ziętek smiled and quickly wrote a letter with some indirect threats attached to a pre-prepared proclamation of the 2027 Jamboree written by Ziętek himself, ready to be signed by Duda.\nThings are finally looking up."

zhp.2.t:0 "The Deliberations begin"
zhp.2.desc:0 "'Order! Order!' - the voice of troop leader Orsza was booming in the open fields near the Fortress.\nHe still couldn't believe Rudy finally got the Scoutmaster to call the Jamboree. Now that all of the representatives are here, it's Orsza's job to make them see reason and try to achieve a partial compromise. It won't be easy. The overzealous Idealists will try to sway other groups to their outlandish ideals, while being hampered by the ZHR and verbally attacked by 'Zawisza'. And the creeps from the Gray Lily will just stare eerily… Better that than having them step in…"
zhp.2.a:0 "My dear companions, it's time to talk." 

zhp.3.t:0 "The Conservative's Plan"

Before we're done with the issue of the economy, we need to address what our future potential will be focused on.\n\nThe ZHP members gave each others knowing looks.\n\n- The army - their leader exclaimed - we've already wasted the capabilities of our population on indulgence and indolence instead of following the Partisans' Way. The least we can do is use the ZHR’s methods to bolster our soldiers.\n- Objection - the voice of the ZHR leader was harsh and determined - The question of the military is dealt with in another line of voting. We recognize the importance of taking care of the army, but we cannot overlook the fact that it cannot function without a strong civilian economy.\n- If it were up to me, you'd be detained for sabotaging the military! -\n\nThe chaotic argument erupted once more.\n\n - I can't believe these guys - Orsza whispered disenhearted. Then he gave a long look to the High Quartermaster sitting next to him - What would be your suggestion, companion Zośka?\nSince no faction would bring this up anytime soon, I would suggest we focus on infrastructure and logistics as a compromise. -"

unification.4.desc:0 "Ever since the tragic accident in Bałuty, it seemed like most of the past Łódź Voivodeship was doomed to spiral into insanity. Today, however, the population of Łódź breathed a sigh of relief, welcoming a familiar sight in the region's capital. \n\nEver since their inception in 1910, various Polish Scout movements fought for the Polish state - be it in the uprisings at the end of WW1 or in the Warsaw uprising during WW2, and they continue to do so to this day, having just kicked out the last hostile clique out of Łódź. Andrzej Duda, who assumed the role of the Scoutmaster of the Autonomous Troop of ZHP thanks to his previous ties within the group, has declared his intentions of creating a civil government and returning the rule of law to the region. However, given the idealism of some in the ZHP, as well as the Banner's domain's decentralized structure, we predict it's gonna take a while before a real state apparatus starts evolving on Łodz’s soil."

Without the next step our economic ideas will not give the most efficient  results\n - As if they could give any results at all.\n\nThe chaotic argument erupted once more.\n\nI can't believe these guys - Orsza whispered disenhearted.

zhp.6.t:0 "Fragile Disobedience"
zhp.6.desc:0 "It seemed more than straightforward, the choices that led us to this. The Gray Lilies were the best in everything, so we let them lead. They have the most faith in us, so we tap their zeal. Soon enough I didn’t even mind. He led by example. A dispassionate example, methodical, efficient. He was presented as the epitome of scouting values, and whatever he did, it was our ambition to do it like him. Hunt prey like him. Butcher and skin it with the same dispassion that he had, even as many of us were squeamish about the dirty work of skinning a fresh animal. His mere gaze was enough to replace it with fear, and force us to learn. \n\nStraying is inevitable. Someone, somewhere, will always be the weakest link. \n\nStory as old as humankind. Some fair-eyed maid steals a man’s eye, gets the notion where none belong. It’s like trying to enfore a ban on sex, all that leads to is some diligently following it and all the others to somehow try to breach it. I begin to understand it now, possibly - The goal must be to find such contrarians and weed them out. That and those who are too weak to be useful to us..\n\nLike Adam from our squad. A weak scout in the commander’s eyes, which meant he was competent and not much more. I hear the summons and there he is, shoved into the sleeping bag by the commander. Another bag was wiggling madly, presumably containing a pretty-fair maid that stole the boy’s heart. I knew what would follow. Normally we’d move to the nearest lake: but this was happening at a lake. It’s like they never saw Friday the 13th: Else surely they’d know better than to date around the lakes. After all, Jason has nothing on Grey Lilies. \n\nIt’s one thing to hear what happens to fornicators, it’s another to experience it: Quickly I imagined them sinking in sleeping bags, tied to rocks. It’d be claustrophobic and… at least they weren’t being burned alive in them. But my mind already rendered my face pale. I almost jumped when the commander saw me like this. - Got something to say? - he asked, watching me with a mute expression."
zhp.6.a:0 "A scout is always obedient to his parents and his superiors"

zhp.7.t:0 "The Hidden Bunker"
zhp.7.desc:0 "- These damned jacks-in-office - Jan Kolbuszowski mumbled as he was marching with his squad through the dreadful marshes near Wieluń. His coat was getting thoroughly soaked because of the rain.\nAfter he completed Rudy's task and found Duda's family, the Scoutmaster made sure that 'Rudy's lapdog' is to be sent to the harshest patrols.\n- Why does the scouting have to involve so much... scouting.\nAs if the weather wasn't bad enough the squad he was dispatched with couldn't shut up about their stances on the ZHP politics. 'The Grey Lilies will doom us', 'This type of sedition destroyed Poland in the first place'. As if who's in charge would somehow change the mud we have to trudge through.\nThe discussion ended abruptly, when one of the scouts he sent as the vanguard returned with the news about a hidden government bunker full of weapons.\n- It's quite a find, don't you think, companion? - asked the young scout.\n- Indeed, it is - replied Kolbuszowski - Doesn't change the fact they could've sent us after this massive rainstorm has passed. - he added in his thoughts - Let's get a closer look.\nIt turned out the bunker was full of relatively new rifles, grenade launchers and even drones and armed vehicles. Not so compatible with the orthodox scouting way.\n- I've got to send a letter to command about this.\nHe could already hear various factions arguing, saying things like..."

I’m saying he should. -\n\nHe was busy hooking the sleeping bags up to their respective rocks. I had very little time.\n\n- Adam’s guilty, of course, but there is a better way of punishing him. Back in Ancient Rome, the soldiers guilty of an offense would draw lots. Each tenth man would have to be killed by his fellow soldiers… -\n\nMy whispers saved the boy’s life, for he ordered one bag to be detached from the rock. Out went the boy, like a larva from its cocoon. But the girl wasn’t as lucky as he was. The Lily stood before the penitent, making him first look him in the eye. And offered him something he never offered anyone as long as he served: Mercy. Provided of course the boy… burns the bridge that led him astray. \n\n*BLAM*\n\nHe spoke nothing this day, or the next. He set up his shelter later on that day with mute, methodical precision, walked and washed like a zombie. But as a scout, he performed well. That’s all that the Lily cared about. Soon enough I had his ear.\n\nIf I objected, I’d die with them. If I did nothing, they’d both die. But I had a solution. Not to spare them, but to do what I do: Make lemonade. It was the right thing to do, this I know for certain. It meant one person marked for death would be spared. I saved a life today. And gave the Scouts a well-drilled comrade. One with a certain… robust obedience\n\nChanging the world is not a way to survive. But surviving is what I do."

As his jeep was approaching the fortifications of the Scout's capital, he saw a truck stopped by one of the gates.\n- What do you mean 'It can't be sold'? It was perfectly fine just two weeks ago. -\n- New laws - a guard responded mechanically - Scouts are not allowed to indulge by eating or drinking articles deemed luxurious.\n- Luxurious? It's just sugar! - the trader couldn't believe his ears.\n- I don't have time for this. Pack up or your cargo will be confiscated -\nThen he saluted Rudy's convoy and ordered his men to open the second gate destined for the officials.\nThey passed the truck without seeing how the situation would conclude.\n- This merchant better stop acting up or he won't be trading anything at all - Rudy thought.\n\nWhen they finally drove past the gate, Rudy saw the whole complex was renovated to train a new wave of conscripted children. Our recruiters started to search for strong and smart children from the age of 3 and conscript them into our new system. The willingness of their parents is not necessary, yet still they are often enthusiastic about the prospect as the Scout’s training ensures security and food for their offspring.\nI wish the littlest ones had time for their childhood, however we don't choose the reality we live in. While other factions waste precious resources for their frivolous caprices, we have a real chance to dominate the land and end the post-Fall chaos.\nWe have to win, otherwise..."

He had quite a clear idea already: The youngest would help deliver the mail, the 15-17s would do simple scouting, sabotage and field propaganda. The oldest would engage in regular fights. This system is based on the one, which was implemented during WW2, there's no reason to reinvent the wheel.\nThe kids are eager to learn and their parents are impressed by the progress their children are making. Our adherence to Catholicism helps us gain their support even more.\nHis train of thought was stopped by a girl guide, who couldn't be older than 5. She handed him a card with a crudely made portrait of him.\n- Our team wanted to thank you for organizing all of this! - she exclaimed."

POLITICS_ANDRZEJ_DUDA_DESC:0 "The former President of Poland since 2015 and one of the most legitimate claimants of rulership over Poland among its warlords. Prior to assuming his presidency, he was part of the Sejm and European Parliament. During the final years of his presidency, he continued to lose agency over his actions, becoming more and more subservient to the will of the head of PiS - Jarosław Kaczyński. By 2025, when his presidency ended for good, he was no more than just a figurehead. When Kaczyński was gone and Poland collapsed, Duda, who already served his two terms, was deemed unimportant by the remains of the political establishment. With no political allies he had to search for a safe haven. He eventually joined forces with the ZHR to which he had once belonged. While the ZHR planned to restore Duda as the rightful president of Poland, their overzealous compatriots - the idealists form ZHP decided to turn Duda once again into a puppet and a head of their state in name only, using him as a legitimizing factor in their future conquest of Poland"

The upheaval and societal collapse brought upon by the Fall caused the liberal population of the city to chase him out for his staunchly traditionalist and controversial rhetoric, with no hope of returning to the archdiocese any time soon. He returned to Łódź and made it his goal to help the catholic scouts oppose the influence and maniacal rule championed by the ZHP."
