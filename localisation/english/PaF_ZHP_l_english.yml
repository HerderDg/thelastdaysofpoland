POLITICS_ANDRZEJ_DUDA_DESC:0 "Andrzej Duda (born 16 May 1972) - Polish lawyer and politician who has served as President of Poland since 2015. Prior to assuming the presidency, he was elected to the Sejm from 2011 to 2014 and European Parliament from 2014 until 2015. President of Poland from 2015 to 2025. During the final years of his presidency, he continued to lose agency over his actions, becoming more and more subservient to the will of the head of PiS - Jarosław Kaczyński. When Kaczyński was gone and Poland collapsed Duda, who already served his two terms, was deemed unimportant by the remains of the political establishment. With no political allies he had to search for a safe haven. He eventually joined forces with ZHR to which he had once belonged to. While ZHR planned to restore Duda as the rightful president of Poland, their overzealous compatriots - the idealists form ZHP decided to turn Duda once again into a puppet and a head of their state in name only, using him as a legitimizing factor in their future conquest of Poland."
POLITICS_MAREK_JEDRASZEWSKI_DESC:0 "Marek Jędraszewski (born 24 July 1949) is a Polish Roman Catholic prelate who has been Archbishop of Kraków since 8 December 2016. He served as the Archbishop of Łódź from 2012 to 2017. He has also been Vice-President of the Polish Episcopal Conference since 2014. His selection for the Kraków archdiocese was perceived as a surprise in some quarters. After the upheaval typical to the collapsing sociaty Jędraszewski was cast out from Krakow by the liberal population of the city because of his staunchly traditionalist and controversial rethoric. He returned to Łódź and helped local catholic boy scouts to organize opposition to the maniacal rule of ZHP."
