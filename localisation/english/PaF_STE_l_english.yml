unification.74.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Merchant Republic of Szczecin unifies West Pomerania!"
unification.74.desc:0 "In West Pomerania, the stories of the old Hansa never truly died. For some, they proved to be the inspiration for their greatest struggle yet. In an unprecedented display of cooperation, the major corporations of Szczecin banded together, forming a council akin to the former merchant republics. Combining their strengths, they quickly overpowered both the remnants of Tusk’s forces, as well as all other contenders for regional dominance. The confederation now faces its greatest test, as no longer bound by a common enemy, the corporations act independently once more, often in open competition and defiance of existing agreements. For the continued survival of the republic, the currently loose central authority of the council will have to be greatly strengthened, or else conflicting business interests will tear the fledgling state apart before it could even truly get off the ground."
