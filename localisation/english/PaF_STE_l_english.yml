STE_piotr_krzystek_desc: "Elected as Mayor of Szczecin all the way back in 2006, Piotr Krzystek has been resisting against PiS policies alongside with his contemporary mayors from other western cities. After falling out of grace with Donald Tusk in 2010, he was a bulwark of nonpartisanship on the edge of a tempestous political storm that took over Poland, especially when Warsaw sent the military to put down riots in 2025.\n\nUpon the announcement of the Eurokorps intervention on request of Tusk, unnotified Krzystek welcomed the mainly German troops in the city. On one hand, his ideology gravitated way closer to Berlin than to Warsaw, on the other, the geographical location of Szczecin so close to the German border put it in a precarious position, so the intervention was welcomed without resistance. However what was meant to be a peaceful operation, soon turned to be an all out war with the loyalist units of the Polish army.\n\nKrzystek was deposed from his position as situation on the front worsened. The new German administration called it "prevention from a possible local insurgency", but in his mind it was surely a petty revenge from Tusk. The ex-mayor went into hiding and formed an underground resistance group, the Griffin Guard, with the aim to depose the occupying German forces.\n\nNow, after months of conflict with local authorities, with support from two out of three Hanza corporations, victory has finally been achieved. As the Eurokorps retreated, the Gryphon flies over Szczecin once more. Now Krzystek, as the leader of a Western Pomeranian powerhouse can consolidate his rule and his loyal populace can finally live free from mistakes of both Warsaw and Berlin."
STE_lindner_desc: "The leader of the Freie Demokratische Partei and former Minister of Finance of the Eurostaat, upon less than fruitful power struggles in Berlin on the eve of the intervention, has been appointed the Gouverneur of the Free City of Stettin. Whether the move was truly a promotion, as the lavish ceremony at the old Pomeranian Dukes' castle would seem to suggest, or simply a punishment for speaking out too loudly against his colleagues' actions during the operation remains unknown, at least officially; however, being pushed aside, thrown out from the halls of the Bundestag to guard an unwilling prize of a conflict he personally opposed has left Christian Lindner feeling strongly embittered towards his compatriots in Berlin.\n\nThe new governor is trying desperately to maintain order and bring prosperity to the Lübeck of Vorpommern, yet constant protests and insurgent activities of the Polish citizenry make the process all but easy. Desperate to ascertain a modicum of autonomy from the controlling grasp of Eurokommissariat Westpolen and too proud to rely on aid from those who spurned him, Lindner has been forced to make pragmatic deals with those he was supposed to govern with a strong hand, stacking his administration with advisors from the region's influential corporations: Polsteam, Netto, and Chemiewerke Pölitz.\n\nWhile Lindner hoped that the considerable economic privileges granted to the local companies would help him maintain order, he soon found himself backed into yet another corner. Seeing the influence they could yield if they combined their operations, the Big Three joined forces, forming the Hanseatic Guild - an organization that quickly established an oligopoly on the city's whole financial sector, effectively tying the noose on which to hang the governor should he ever step out of line.\n\nPlagued with violent insurgents and ruthless capitalists, Lindner's administration stands on dangerously shaky ground. For now, the Stadtpolizei, with middling support from the local garrison of Eurokorps from Eurokommissariat Westpolen, maintains the fragile peace, or at least the illusion thereof, but it remains to be seen whether this balance shall hold, or if, just like when German formations rolled through Polish soil, Stettin is doomed to be the first domino to fall."

STE_griffon_partisans_desc: "The city of Stettin is plagued with countless bands of insurgents who sabotage the regime at just about every level of operation. Subversive activity ranges from plastering public spaces with anti-government flyers and indiscriminate vandalism to, at times, an armed militia that often clashes with the local police forces. The Stadtpolizei is spread thin trying to put out the fires of rebellion, but just like a hydra, one flame extinguished causes two more to start elsewhere. Backed against the increasingly enclosing walls, we are struggling to get anything done in the current situation."

With the tide turning in favor of the government, a large-scale witch hunt spearheaded by the Eurokorps has begun across the entire city and its surroundings to snuff out any remaining forms of organized resistance. Lindner's administration is hopeful that this final crackdown will be enough to quell the rebellious spirit of the populace."

Calling themselves "Castle," they aim to preserve traditional values and strengthen presidential power. Given their increasing popularity among older voters, it is evident that they will secure a significant number of seats in parliament. However, the prospect of obtaining enough seats to govern independently appears highly unrealistic. Most likely, they would have to share their power and merge ideas into one project with the Summer Union. Nonetheless, ambitious leader Zbigniew Bogucki is determined to broaden his voter base and will do everything necessary to achieve this goal."

The largest room available was designated to be a gathering chamber, with seats for representatives from Summer and Castle factions on either side and the seat at the top reserved for the Leader himself.

A new framework for cooperation was agreed upon: the city is to provide favourable business conditions, streamlined taxation, and assurances of public procurement contracts. In return, the private sector has pledged to maintain employment levels and ensure market stability to the greatest extent possible.\n\nAlthough the agreement itself has yet to be made public, its effects are expected to be felt immediately.

A rise in violent incidents and the reappearance of a now-infamous slogan—“Niebko Terror”—spray-painted across a central bridge. Believed to be the work of local ultras, the phrase has become a symbol of chaotic defiance and urban fear. One officer, off the record, said bluntly: “Bandits? In my Szczecin?

President Piotr Krzystek will convene with his closest advisors and the leaders of the two largest political parties. Reliable sources suggest that the primary topic of discussion will be the reconstruction of the city of Szczecin and the wider region of the former Western Pomerania Voivodeship. The meeting will also aim to ensure that the national rebuilding process proceeds smoothly, free of political conflict, disputes, or factional clashes between Castle and Summer Union."
STE_national_healthcare_act_of_date: "National Healthcare Act of [GetYear]"
STE_national_healthcare_act_of_date_desc: "Both the Summer Union and the Castle agree that a form of national healthcare is essential to guarantee the well-being and happiness of every citizen. However, each party envisions a different model: the Union advocates for the Beveridge system, while the Castle supports a partial reimbursement approach. The debate has sparked intense public interest and growing media coverage, as healthcare remains a deeply personal issue for many. Ultimately, the final decision rests with the ruling party, which will have to weigh both proposals carefully before shaping the future of the nation’s healthcare system."
STE_leash_the_golden_calf: "[GetIndustrialCharter]"
STE_industrial_charter_scripted: "The Industrial Charter"
STE_golden_calf_scripted: "Leash the Golden Calf"
STE_leash_the_golden_calf_desc: "A fully free market, under current conditions, would be detrimental to our national interests. As a developing country without a solid industrial base or firm control over key sectors, we require at least a minimal level of regulation to ensure stability and long-term growth. Encouragingly, both sides of parliament agree on the need for oversight. The concern, however, lies in the government’s continued hesitation to assert economic independence. There is growing unease that certain foreign actors hold disproportionate sway over domestic policy. The time has come for national leadership to prioritise the country’s needs over outside influence."
STE_education_act_of_date: "Education Act of [GetYear]"
STE_education_act_of_date_desc: "After restoring the core institutions of the state, the government will now focus on reforming and revitalizing the nation’s education system. President Piotr Krzystek has pledged to prioritize the reconstruction and reopening of schools that were damaged during the German invasion, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to learn in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nEqually important is the revival of local universities and polytechnic institutions, which will play a critical role in shaping the country’s intellectual and technological future.\n\n An educated and informed society is the strongest safeguard against the mistakes of the past, such as the rise of the PiS government. We must ensure that such democratic backsliding is never repeated."
STE_unionisation: "Unionisation"
STE_unionisation_desc: "The industrial sector of West Pomerania, excluding PŻM and its subsidiary companies, is currently poorly organized. Polish trade unions were dismantled during the intervention, following the German counterinsurgency policies.\n\nIn response, the government encourages and actively supports the formation of new trade unions that unite workers from similar sectors. This initiative aims to strengthen workers' positions against corporate dominance and to help the state better identify and address the challenges faced by the working population.\n\nA robust network of unions will also contribute to long-term economic stability by fostering dialogue between labor and industry. Moreover, it reflects the government's commitment to rebuilding not just infrastructure, but the democratic foundations of labor rights."
STE_advisory_devolution: "Advisory Devolution"
STE_advisory_devolution_desc: "Decision-making cannot be confined solely to the central level. The government acknowledges the need for external input, local voices that can guide and support it in addressing the most pressing national issues. Nonetheless, we all know that democracy is not a caucus, obtaining a fixed term of office by promises, and then doing what it likes with the people. We hold that there ought to be a constant relationship between the rulers and the people. "Government of the people, by the people, for the people," still remains the sovereign definition of democracy."
STE_stop_go_economics: "'Stop, Go' Economics"
STE_stop_go_economics_desc: "In a surprising move, the government has unveiled its adoption of a so-called "Stop-Go" economic policy - a strategy marked by short bursts of rapid growth followed by abrupt slowdowns. Officials claim this flexible approach will allow the state to “react dynamically” to market shifts.\n\nHowever, critics warn that it signals a return to instability. The policy risks undermining long-term development, leaving workers, unions, and smaller industries vulnerable to sudden cutbacks and inconsistent support. As West Pomerania struggles to rebuild, this erratic direction may deepen uncertainty instead of resolving it."
STE_mantain_a_tight_grip: "Mantain a Tight Grip"
STE_mantain_a_tight_grip_desc: "Although the military aspects of the state of emergency are gradually reducing, it is still too early to lift it completely. The government will maintain a strong, civilian-focused approach to ensure economic stability through ongoing price controls, rationing, and oversight of key sectors.\n\nWe will not relinquish control over essential aspects of daily life until we are confident that every household can achieve a fair and sustainable standard of living. That is not a measure of oppression; relatively, it is a guaranteed protection during our recovery. The return to full normalcy must be built on stable, inclusive, and resilient foundations."
STE_nationalise_captured_assets: "Nationalise Captured Assets"
STE_nationalise_captured_assets_desc: "The nationalization of privatized industrial infrastructure will ensure the state's complete control over production lines and key supply chains. That decision is not just ideological; it is practical, allowing industrial output to be adjusted in real time to meet changing market demands and social needs.\n\nBy eliminating foreign and speculative interests from strategic sectors, we can allocate resources more efficiently, prioritize reconstruction efforts, and respond better to crises. National oversight also enables us to guarantee fair labor practices, stabilize prices, and prevent exploitative monopolies.\n\nThis policy will establish a self-reliant economy that prioritizes its citizens and is prepared to face the long-term challenges of recovery and development."
STE_secure_production: "Secure Production"
STE_secure_production_desc: "The more we focus on re-equipping and modernizing our productive capacities, especially in key sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and infrastructure, the sooner we can achieve stable and self-sustaining production. This initiative is not just technical; it is strategic. By investing in stronger and more resilient production systems today, we can accelerate our economic recovery, reduce dependence on external pressures, and ultimately improve the standard of living for all citizens.\n\nModernization is a necessity. Each improvement in machinery, processes, and coordination enhances our ability to meet essential needs, minimize waste, and create a more equitable and efficient economy. A short-term emphasis on production security will lead to long-term benefits in prosperity, stability, and national well-being."
STE_rationalizing_rationing: "Rationalizing Rationing"
STE_rationalizing_rationing_desc: "The expectation that war-damaged agricultural lands can fully satisfy the food demands of cities and towns is currently unrealistic. This situation would place excessive social and economic pressure on rural communities. Therefore, we must continue to promote restraint in consumption and maintain the food rationing system to ensure equitable distribution of available resources.\n\nThanks to the unification of the voivodeship and improved coordination of our agricultural production and distribution networks, we can cautiously begin to ease some of these restrictions. However, it remains vital for all citizens to be mindful of their consumption and support these measures as we work towards restoring food security and rebuilding a sustainable agricultural foundation."
STE_state_housing: "State Housing"
STE_state_housing_desc: "We will initiate large-scale, state-led housing projects in every city, town, and bigger village to ensure every resident has a roof over their head as quickly as possible. These homes will not be luxurious; this is not a time for extravagance. Instead, they will be practical, standardized dwellings designed to efficiently and equitably meet basic living needs.\n\nBy prioritizing uniformity, we can ensure speed, cost-effectiveness, and fairness. In the face of crisis and displacement, our focus is not on opulence but on providing dignity, shelter, and a stable foundation on which our country can be rebuilt."
STE_mantainining_employment: "Mantainining Employment"
STE_mantainining_employment_desc: "Ensuring stable employment requires keeping key industries operational. The government will focus on sectors most vulnerable to economic fluctuations, particularly those reliant on capital investment and exports.\n\nMaintaining a steady pace of construction in housing, factories, and infrastructure is a top priority, as it represents nearly half of national capital spending. We will work closely with major industries and public bodies to coordinate long-term investments aimed at preventing instability.\n\nIn urgent situations, we will support the population through tax relief, guaranteed loans, and other direct assistance. Economic resilience depends on preparedness rather than improvised responses."
STE_wind_down_the_gears_of_war: "Wind Down the Gears of War"
STE_wind_down_the_gears_of_war_desc: "The war for the unification of the voivodeship is long over. What remains now is the far more difficult task of building something lasting for years. The temporary suspension of civil norms, initially justified by necessity, will soon end. Instead of maintaining the framework of a state of emergency, the government has proposed a carefully timed strategy of gradual economic reactivation. The approach prioritises long-term stability, focusing on a controlled “thaw” of the economy. This strategy has been presented as the only responsible course of action, measured, deliberate, and aimed at securing prosperity in the years to come."
STE_partners_in_business: "Partners in Business"
STE_partners_in_business_desc: "Smaller enterprises acquired during the unification will be placed under the supervision of the Hanseatic Guild. Some may see this move as controversial or even unjust, especially those advocating for full state ownership. However, the decision reflects a pragmatic approach which is aimed at ensuring economic stability and continuity. Nationalisation, which stands fully against ZKL beliefs, could lead to administrative chaos, sudden disruptions in supply chains, and the loss of experienced local management. The Hanseatic oversight will guarantee that these businesses remain operational, competitive, and integrated into a broader regional market. It is a compromise, not without cost, but necessary for the recovery of our nation’s economy."
STE_housing_contracts: "Housing Contracts"
STE_housing_contracts_desc: "While the state possesses the capacity to carry out key infrastructure and construction projects independently, experience shows that the inclusion of private businesses and corporate partners leads to significantly greater efficiency. By involving the private sector, we can accelerate project timelines, reduce overall costs, and ensure higher standards of quality and innovation. Moreover, public-private cooperation allows us to better allocate national resources, attract investment, and stimulate local economies. This approach not only delivers immediate benefits but also lays the foundation for sustainable growth and long-term prosperity. In times of reconstruction, pragmatism must prevail over outdated economic dogmas."
STE_security_and_incentive: "Security & Incentive"
STE_security_and_incentive_desc: "The government reaffirms its commitment to building an economy where effort is rewarded and leadership is earned. To encourage initiative and productivity, direct taxation and wage structures will be adjusted. While fair base wages will remain guaranteed, performance-based bonuses and piece-rate systems will be promoted across various sectors, with methods tailored to individual industries.\n\nAdditionally, a clear standard for leadership will be maintained. Every position, from the workshop to the boardroom, must be open to those best qualified to serve. Advancement will be based on merit rather than privilege, ensuring that talent, loyalty, and dedication lead our national recovery."
STE_restore_village_life: "Restore Village Life"
STE_restore_village_life_desc: "A vigorous campaign must be launched to boost the productivity of Pomeranian farms and gardens. Farmers have long lacked clear direction, as well as access to essential tools, machinery, feed, and fertilisers necessary to expand domestic food production. Guaranteed markets and fair, profitable prices must be ensured so that everyone in the industry understands what is expected of them. Increased output, particularly of eggs, bacon, and other livestock products, is urgently needed to reduce dependence on imports and safeguard our foreign exchange.\n\nAttracting sufficient labour to the land will only be possible if rural housing and local amenities are quickly and effectively upgraded. Village life must be revitalised, and this task must be treated as a national priority."
STE_putting_food_on_the_tables: "Putting Food On the Tables"
STE_putting_food_on_the_tables_desc: "Though often underestimated, agriculture remains one of the most vital pillars of our nation’s long-term development. The government is fully committed to the belief that Pomeranian agriculture and horticulture, once modernised and operating at full capacity, will become more important than ever in ensuring food security and contributing to the prosperity of urban centres.\n\nAn expanding and resilient domestic agricultural sector will not only stabilise food supply but will also unlock new markets for manufactured goods, particularly in the sectors of agricultural machinery, dairy equipment, and rural infrastructure. In doing so, agriculture can become the backbone of a sustainable and valuable export economy, driving innovation and national self-sufficiency well into the future."
STE_testing_the_limit: "Testing the Limit"
STE_testing_the_limit_desc: "The reality is that there is a limit to how much of their personal income citizens are willing to let the state claim, especially during peacetime. However, as economic pressures increase and state responsibilities grow, the government must consider raising taxes to maintain fiscal balance.\n\nThis necessary action will not come without consequences. The Hanseatic Guild, which has long been cautious about increased government interference in commerce and finance, has already expressed its dissatisfaction. Additional taxation could exacerbate this rift, potentially threatening the delicate alliance between the government and the trade sector."
STE_relief_for_earned_incomes: "Relief for Earned Incomes"
STE_relief_for_earned_incomes_desc: "The current system has significant flaws. It is overly complex and places a disproportionately heavy burden on those who exert extra effort. We therefore believe that serious consideration should be given to reducing the gaps between different tax levels and addressing the current imbalance, where overtime and additional income from extra work are taxed at a much higher rate than regular wages.\n\nAdditionally, we recommend raising the threshold below which personal savings are excluded from means testing. We should also work to expand the range of modest savings that are exempt from income tax altogether."
STE_infrastructural_woes: "Infrastructural Woes"
STE_infrastructural_woes_desc: "We will formally request assistance from the British government, specifically seeking the expertise of their specialists to help develop and modernize the road and rail infrastructure in West Pomerania. They have decades of experience in complex transport systems and post-crisis reconstruction; British engineers can provide valuable insights and practical solutions. This collaboration will accelerate our regional recovery, enhance internal connectivity, and integrate West Pomerania more effectively into the European transport network. It represents a pragmatic step toward rebuilding our country with resilience, efficiency, and international cooperation. Without a good rail network and core infrastructure, our country cannot function properly."
STE_transport_of_the_common_man: "Transport of the Common Man"
STE_transport_of_the_common_man_desc: "The government has acquired several older double-decker buses from the United Kingdom to replenish the municipal and intercity bus fleets, which were either destroyed or requisitioned during the intervention.\n\n Although these vehicles are not new, they provide a practical and cost-effective solution to address the current shortage in public transportation. Their introduction will help restore connectivity between towns and cities, relieve the burden on local commuters, and symbolize the gradual return to normalcy. This temporary measure is part of a larger strategy to rebuild critical infrastructure across the region and allow citizens to use public transportation freely."
STE_chokehold_on_the_order: "Chokehold on the Odra"
STE_chokehold_on_the_order_desc: "We now control the entrance to the trade route that spans the entire Oder River basin. This strategic position enables us to gain significant economic and logistical advantages.\n\n By managing the flow of goods through one of Central Europe’s most important waterways, we are not only enhancing our economic standing but also gaining influence over regional trade dynamics. The state will ensure that the profits generated from this position are reinvested into infrastructure, port modernization, and social programs, so that all citizens, not just corporations, can benefit from the prosperity."
STE_partnerships_upstream: "Partnerships Upstream"
STE_partnerships_upstream_desc: "We are strategically positioned along a key trade corridor, and we are ready to sign trade agreements with interested states located along the Oder River and its tributaries.\n\n These agreements will enhance commerce for all involved parties by streamlining logistics, reducing barriers, and promoting regional interdependence. As the gateway to the Oder basin, we aim not only to achieve profits but also to take on a responsible leadership role in establishing a stable and cooperative economic zone. By fostering mutual benefits, we can strengthen both our neighbors and ourselves.\n\nFor prosperity!"
STE_youve_never_had_it_so_good: "You've Never Had It So Good"
STE_youve_never_had_it_so_good_desc: "After extensive coordination, heated debates, and necessary, but costly arrangements, we can finally say, without a doubt, that we have succeeded. Life for every citizen is now better than it ever was under the rule of Lindner or other warlords. We have achieved a significant milestone; most people believe we are beginning to exceed the living standards of Poland before the collapse. Our work is not yet finished, as the rest of the country still awaits our liberation. However, for now, we have much to celebrate. Our president, Piotr Krzystek, is a man of the people, a saviour of the country. Alright, enough of bullshiting, let's celebrate!"

unification.74.t: "[GetNewspaper]Szczecin unifies West Pomerania!"
unification.74.desc: "In West Pomerania, the stories of the old Hansa never truly died. For some, they proved to be the inspiration for their greatest struggle yet. In an unprecedented display of cooperation, the major corporations of Szczecin banded together, forming a council akin to the former merchant republics. Combining their strengths, they quickly overpowered both the remnants of Tusk's forces, as well as all other contenders for regional dominance. The confederation now faces its greatest test, as no longer bound by a common enemy, the corporations act independently once more, often in open competition and defiance of existing agreements. For the continued survival of the republic, the currently loose central authority of the council will have to be greatly strengthened, or else conflicting business interests will tear the fledgling state apart before it could even truly get off the ground."

szczecin.1.t: "Promised Land"
szczecin.1.desc: "He slept, as he had no more strength to weep over his sorrow state. Although his dreams were blank, dark canvases for thoughts that couldn't form, he found serenity in them. For the first time in years, he was free. At least for as long as he could dream. Feeling nothing of his poor and dirty body, he has throw aside all known limits of his consciousness. He swam through the dark canvases. He visited the memories of his old home at Kościuszki st. He climbed on the old cornices of tenement houses, and then he jumped. He knew that the empty, concrete street below wouldn't stop him from flying further into the dream. Into the never-ending space, pulsing with colours to the rhythm of his weak heart. At the end of it he hid in his room of confidence and safety. It was a literal imaginary room he often conjured up in his short sleep breaks. It helped him to hide form the cruel world since his middle school. Every time something bad happened, he went back to his home and hid his head into pillows, as if into proverbial sand. He was really good at daydreaming... but not this time.\n\nAnd then the sound screamed into his ears. It was a terrible, loud and silly jingle from his television he fell asleep in front of. Janusz opened his sore eyes, slowly but intensively feeling the increasing headache he was sentenced to. And sentenced he was rightfully, for his excessive alcohol consumption. His throat scratched without mercy, and the barely visible bottle of Paulaner still clenched in his hand appeared to be completely emptied. Just as the legion of similar ones, standing proudly around the old sofa Janusz was laid on, more like a dead body than an employee of the month. But still, even in his sorry state, he still was exactly that: recently named the best of the SEC's boiler stokers in Stettin. He had God given right to celebrate, as one of the few still valued poles in this once again german city. At least that's how it was in his mind. They might not pay him with the extra money he wants, but the shopping vouchers they threw at him, he eagerly spent to the last. Good thing the shop he used them at was not too picky on what exactly he could buy, or how much alcohol it had. He felt happy, or at least he wanted to. He needed a break though. His old body couldn't take another bottle of ambrosia, so all that was left was to just sit, wait, and watch the loud television in front of him. The sound and light from the Deutsche Welle programme filled his darkened room. And behind the flatscreen TV, there he was:\n\n"...indeed, your worries are over. As your appointed governor, I will continue to take care of the economic growth and integration of the city." - Christian Lindner spoke proudly. Janusz listened to the voice, whose haughty tone he already had time to get used to.\n"I promise you that from now on, this land and its people will only have good times ahead of them. There is much to be happy about..."\n\nUnfortunately, the next day the man was fired from his work. Had to make a place for someone younger and more able than him..."
szczecin.1.a: "Gott sei dank. Verdammt, das ist echt geil."

szczecin.2.t: "Rude Interruption"
szczecin.2.desc: "A sunny day in Stettin. It was a perfect day to lay back and appreciate the civilizing aspect of the European peacekeeping mission. Unfortunately for Helmuth and his squadmates from the antiterrorist tactical unit, it was the day to answer the call of duty. A secret informant leaked information about a partisan hideout.\n - Ungrateful Poles - Helmuth thought to himself. Once again their pitiful Rzeczpospolita turned out to be a Saisonstaat and instead of being thankful for the professional and quick German help, they rebel against our benevolent administration.\n\n His team approached a position in Kreckow at the edges of Stettin. As was established by their intel, the suspects were hiding in the old World War 2 bunkers. As always Poles preferred nostalgia and pathos instead of functionality and discretion.  Each soldier assumed his position ensuring no traitor could escape or mount a successful counterattack. The commander gave a sign for Helmuth to approach the rebel base to estimate the danger. Quiet like a leopard, Helmut moved closer to the bunker's timeworn brick walls.\n'Strike the German!' 'Drive Fritzes away!' 'Shoot!' 'Shoot'!\nYoung policeman couldn't understand all the words being said. Nevertheless, he came to the frightening conclusion that the Poles in the bunker were ready to execute an innocent captured German settler. In a matter of milliseconds, he gave the signal to the captain, who in turn authorized another member of the strike team to use gas grenades. \n - Get down on the ground! - the antiterrorists shouted in Polish once the grenades went off, throwing the suspects on the paved .\nFour men and one woman were apprehended. The base contained some sort of communication equipment with an independent energy source and a stash of Molotov cocktails. At least that could be determined with all this smoke around.\n What's weird, the criminals' victim was nowhere to be found. Come to think of it the terrorists weren't wearing any military gear or uniforms and they didn't seem to be in physical shape to live the demanding life of guerilla fighters. The dispersing of gas finally allowed policemen to realize what really happened. The communication equipment turned out to be self-repaired TV. The stash of Molotovs was in fact an enormous pile of bottles of moonshine. Helmuth, still cautious, approached the screen with his machine gun ready to fire. It turned out the Poles were just watching an archival Polish vs Germany match from 2014.\n - It's a drinking den. Not a rebel base. - the fresh recruit finally stated the obvious.\nNot long after one of the apprehended, free from the initial shock, began to explain the misunderstanding. Probably. Alcohol and burning rage made the rustling Polish language even more uncomprehensible.\n - We could still arrest them, sir. - Helmuth tried to salvage the situation. - Given the reports of rising Brzęczek partisan group deep in Poland, we could still file this under seditious activity.\n - No use - commander replied with a sigh - They're innocent. That'd only antagonize the Poles. Gentlemen, we're done here. Time to have a talk with guys from counter-intelligence."
szczecin.2.a: "'Let's move out.'"

szczecin.3.t: "Our Underworld"
szczecin.3.desc: "Jacek's heart raced like a car on a racetrack. That wasn't how it was supposed to be - he thought - as he fought through the dense Arkonian forest. The quick partisan action turned out to be a bloodbath. He heard the German soldiers catching up to him. He was scared. A few years before, he was an ordinary high school student with dreams, perspectives, and a bright future. When the collapse of Poland began, his stability was gone. After the unfortunate death of his parents during the German invasion, he was vengeful. Being a partisan eased up his pain.\n\nStill, after all, he was never ready for that. Their job primarily involved vandalizing government buildings and putting anti-Lidner posters within the city, which was substantially easy for them. He could potentially spend a few days in prison at most. He couldn't even imagine that they would shoot. Suddenly, he stumbled over an exposed tree root and fell. Jacek didn't know it was already over for him. When he got up and tried to overrun his tormentors, a bullet pierced his leg. \n\nHe let out a silent cry as he fell again. An unbearable pain spread throughout Jacek's entire body. As he endured this agony, his happiest memories flashed before his eyes. Beloved Kasia, vacations in Kołobrzeg with the long-gone parents, wandering through the streets of Szczecin with his classmates - it all seemed like a fever dream. Orders shouted by the captain of the approaching soldiers felt like a different realm. \n\nThe reality struck when a brutal German delivered a swift kick to his stomach. Jacek cought violently. And what do we have here? - the soldier spoke with arrogance combined with curiosity - another Polish scum?\nSoldiers cornered the young partisan from every side.\n\nLet me handle this, Hans. The uncompromising voice spoke from behind as it quickly advanced to the scene. The German officer crouched before Jacek and looked directly into his eyes.\nHello, young boy. What is your name?\nJacek, sir - as he replied, his voice cracked in fear\nI'm Colonel Helmuth Bluthgeld. I will be clear: your life depends entirely on your honesty with me in the coming moments.\nPlease tell me where your main base is, and I will let you go free. As simple as that - he smiled.\nI dunno, sir; they never provided me with all the details.\n\nBluthgeld glanced at his band as if giving them a silent command.\n No, no, please! - Jacek cried in despair. There is a house in Warszewo, on Urlopowa Street, where we all used to meet. I beg you not to kill me.\n\nThe colonel pretended to let out a slight sigh of relief.\n\nAs promised, I will set you free.\n\nIt was mere seconds when Helmuth reached for his gun. Jacek barely realized what was happening. Shot rang through the vast forest. Another innocent life has been lost, joining the many others who have suffered the same fate."

szczecin.4.t: "Ausweiss Bitte"
szczecin.4.desc: "Major Andrzej Biedrzycki was furious when the German garrison at Hansa Brücke detained him for several hours. Although he had all the documents necessary for passage they held him back, likely out of malice towards one of the few high-ranking Poles remaining in the Szczecin military command. They also made sure he felt like a lesser individual, sitting on a painfully uncomfortable stool in a dimly lit interrogation room.\n\nHe was just coming back from his \"work trip\" to the city's eastern bank. Officially collecting orders from the Eurokommissariat Westpolen's Military HQ, the true nature of his visit was a meeting with General Szymon Koziatek, who, like many other Poles still serving the EKW's machine, was disappointed with Tusk's regime. It became evident from the information he gathered that European rule in Szczecin was, indeed, coming to an end. Soon, the German garrison would retreat to Berlin, leaving the citizens of Szczecin a chance to reclaim their city. Biedrzycki's primary and most important role was to inform the Griffin Guard about this impending chance for revolution.\n\nAndrzej was not a revolutionary. Once news of the German intervention hit, he believed Szczecin would eventually return to Polish rule through gradual, evolutionary changes. However, he was mistaken – the germans gutted the Polish administration, made them second-class citizens in their own city. And the reports he read about Helmuth's Bluthgeld anti-guerilla operations? The senseless cruelty inflicted upon his people struck him deeply. That is why he contacted the Griffin Guard; to atone for his sins.\n\nThe inspection lasted for over an hour. Biedrzycki was seething with anger on the inside, but he kept his calm demeanor in the name of the mission. Hopefully this was the last time he had to endure such treatment. When they finally allowed Andrzej to pass, he just smirked, entered his military G-Wagon, and drove towards the west bank.\n\nSzczecin was not the city he had known throughout his life anymore. Even if the war had not significantly impacted it, the problem lay in the atmosphere. Life in the city felt uneasy - wealthy Germans occupied the homes once belonging to Polish elites, and foreign troops watched every corner. Living in Szczecin felt like sitting on a powder keg, ready to explode at any moment. Closing in on the designated meeting spot, his heart was pounding wildly - afraid of being followed, the major checked every car mirror at least a dozen times before making the final turn.\n\nHe entered the seemingly abandoned house in the Gumieńce district. There, sitting on a dilapidated couch, his handler greeted him. After confirming their loyalties to the cause with a simple code phrase, Biedrzycki passed along the necessary information about the German retreat. Then both men simply nodded and hurriedly left the house.\n\nWhen he drove to the station, he knew."

szczecin.5.t: "Sehr geehrter Herr Lindner..."
szczecin.5.desc: "Sitting idly in his office, Christian Lindner felt like a ruin of a man. Slouched, hands on his temples, breath anxiously quickened, and with a nervous tremor in his right leg that simply refused to go away no matter how hard he tried to still himself. By midday, the Eurogoverneur was on his fourth cup of double-brewed black coffee, not that he needed it to stay alert as the persistent feeling of impending doom did more than enough to keep him awake both during the day and especially at night. He could tell his regime was on its last legs, and yet, all he could see around him was apathy. Indifference. Despite the constant protests, despite armed insurgents openly chanting for his deposition, it seemed like nobody even cared enough to intervene on his behalf. The Fatherland failing him yet again was no surprise, though it did sting what little remained of Lindner's patriotic pride. No, it was his supposed 'partners' sitting by that irked him. They stood just as much to lose and still chose to leave him to do all the work? And now, despite repeated prods and pleas, they just... ignored him? Why would they not even have the courtesy to say ANYTHING?\n\nWhatever the reason may have been, the elegantly styled letter lying in front of Lindner was bound to provide at least some answers. Admiring its sleek design, defaced only by a single crease along one of its corners, the exhausted politician handled the note with utmost care despite his visible unsteadiness, feeling almost guilty as he broke its pristine trident seal. After a deep breath, he began to read the contents.\n\nSehr geehrter Herr Lindner,\n\nWe hope this letter finds You well. Though we express our utmost sympathy for You and Your precarious position, we must regretfully inform You that the recent increases in instability have forced us to temporarily suspend our current partnership and unilaterally void any and all arrangements, whether signed or verbal, with the Freistadt's administration. Should the situation permit it, we remain open to restoring our present ties at a more opportune time. Until then, we kindly ask You to refrain from attempting any contact with our organization or any of its individual members. Our representatives will reach out once we are ready to re-enter negotiations.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, listed below are the contracts that will no longer be in effect as of...\n\nUnwilling to read through the numerous blows dealt to his administration by the Hansa's proclamation, Lindner, overcome with anger at their brazen betrayal, chose to resort to the harshest outburst he could muster in his resigned state. Using all his force, he crumpled the letter, setting aside all concerns about its aesthetic qualities, and threw it carelessly towards the nearest trashcan. As the paper bounced off the metal rim and fell on the ground, the official stared at the unbearable disorder it brought to his otherwise orderly workspace, stood up with a sigh, and dropped it neatly where it belonged before sinking back into his chair, defeated."

szczecin.6.t: "Scold the Companies"
szczecin.6.desc: "Christian Lindner had grown tired of the Hanseatic Guild. His country was on the brink of collapse, and the Guild's support was minimal and filled with meaningless rhetoric. For heaven's sake, the Germans were soon going to abandon him, and the only forces capable of halting the city's decline were those three powerful corporations. As he paced in his office, moving from one corner to another, he contemplated a potential solution to this grave situation. After much deliberation, he decided to draft a strong letter. In his mind, this was the only way to compel them to take action.\n\nBefore getting started, he took a quick walk through City Hall. The news of the impending evacuation had spread rapidly, and many employees were already packing and sealing critical documents. It seemed that nobody believed in his victory. He wanted to proclaim that he would win, that he would prove those buffoons from Berlin wrong and secure the city with or without their support. However, deep down, he knew it was just a fever dream and that his impending doom was close at hand.\n\nUpon returning to his expansive headquarters, he poured himself a whisky. The letter he was about to write would significantly impact his future, and he was determined to craft it as well as possible. The first few sentences came slowly, but soon a flood of words began to flow.\n\nLiebe Mitglieder der Hanse,\n\nOur cooperation has significantly shaped Szczecin into what it is today. The combined strength of the government and the Guild has been more than just a necessary partnership. So why change that now? Why have you chosen to betray me and the German people? I have provided you with the influence, resources, and opportunities to thrive in my city. And this is how you repay me? By ignoring the needs of the state and its population? The Free City of Stettin is collapsing, and you are essentially doing nothing to prevent it from happening. I am deeply disappointed with your actions. Nonetheless, I still remember what you have done for the city. That is your last chance to rethink and reconsider your decisions. I expect your support in the coming days. I assure you that our partnership can bring you significant benefits if you follow very straightforward rules.\n\nFor the sake of clarity and understanding, I have listed them for you in a convenient way...\n\nCrafting a proper letter took him hours, but after numerous revisions, it was finally complete. Lindner felt a sense of fatigue mixed with satisfaction. He had always been seen as calm and submissive, but now he had shown his true strength. He was not weak. Regardless of whether his efforts to fix the city succeeded or failed, he would not back down. It was time to take decisive action to resolve this situation. Christian would certainly make his German colleagues envious, or die with this failed experiment."

szczecin.7.desc: "In the suburbs of Szczecin, just like any other day, punctually at 7 am, a small establishment came to life. "Paszteciki u Mariana" is a small restaurant, run by the same family, started by the namesake, Mr. Marian himself, in the 1960s. People from far parts of the city and beyond have been coming here to get their high-quality deep-fried snacks for decades. Today was just like any other day, when the current owner of the store folded the armoured curtains and opened the doors widely. The tiny shack has seen strife and crises since its establishment, but it stood throughout them proudly, with the recent collapse not being something out of the ordinary. After all, people've gotta eat, as grandpa always said - the owner thought to himself.\n\nStanding outside, his sight was caught by an elderly lady in a red dress and a fuzzy coat, approaching his store with her pommeranian at her side. The sounds of heels and high-pitched barks rang around the empty street covered with a morning haze. \n "Madame Gryzelda, good morning, what a pleasure to see you." - the owner exclaimed, bowing his head before the lady. \n "Gentleman like his father, good morning, Mr. Witold." - she responded while nodding gracefully, her gray locks bobbing softly. \n "I have already prepared your daily order as requested, Madame, and I made sure to pack a little extra for tiny Reksio." Witold smiled warmly and beckoned the lady inside, to which she obliged. \n "People are talking, Mr. Witold, that the new government is taking over small food businesses just like yours, to feed the masses," she whispered. \n "Madame, our little establishment weathered communism and the collapse, we'll survive this too." - With a forced smile, he answered while handing over a paper bag with the goods, alongside a cup with hot borscht. "This time it's on the house, Madame, thank you for your continued support." \n "God bless you, young man." - She gave him a reassuring smile, then left the store, leaving a strong scent of perfume behind her. \n \n Suddenly, a familiar van arrived in front of the store, but instead of jolly Mr. Tadek from the local bakery, it was a troop of armed police officers, heading inside the store, with a man in a black suit leading them, and a small group of engineers in reserve, arriving in a second van. \n "What can I help you with, gentlemen?" - the store owner spoke in an innocent, maybe even naive tone. \n "By the order declared by the city council, we are here to requisition any food and food production supplies, and you're obliged by law to comply." - the man in the suit spoke with a cold, calculated manner while putting a crudely printed out warrant with the city's stamp at the bottom. \n "No, no no no no no no..." - Witold started to plead. "Wait wait wait wait wait!". \n His cries were for naught, however, as the officers in the blink of an eye emptied his store of anything edible, and the engineers disassembled the 60-year-old pasztecik machine."

ekwrozpad.15.t: "The Simple Dream"
ekwrozpad.15.desc: "Piotr Krzystek entered the city hall with unease. As he walked through the main lobby, he resolved to never again rely on a foreign force to accomplish what he should handle himself. The feeling of betrayal lingered deeply in his heart. He realized he had let down his people, but from now on, things would be different - and better. The emptiness of the quickly abandoned building was unsettling, with tons of shredded documents on the floor and every door wide open. Nothing resembled the atmosphere that used to be here. He approached the stairs. A stroll to the upper levels of the city hall evoked many memories in Piotr. Such as he used to greet his hard-working secretary, miss Grażyna. The always cheerful administration. All of this is gone, in the abyss.\n\nAs he approached his former office, his heart began to race. Could this be it? Is he back? His hand shook when he slowly opened the door. After taking a glance throughout the room, he froze. Krzystek looked into the eyes of his biggest enemy, Christian Lindner. He sat at his desk, in his chair, just like Piotr used to do. His heart filled with rage; the only thing he wanted was to tear apart the butcher who had oppressed his people for so long. He slowly approached and sat in front of him. Both men looked into each other's eyes with indifference.\n\nWhy have you stayed here and not escaped like your colleagues? - Krzystek asked with sincere curiosity. I know my wrongdoings. I know what I have done and what I allowed to happen. Honestly, I never wanted this at all: the violence, occupation, and abasement. That slipped through my hands with continuous orders from Berlin and Tusk. You asked why I stayed; I did it because I wanted to face the consequences. I could not live knowing I did not do the bare minimum to atone for my sins.\n\nThat was not the answer he had anticipated. Piotr imagined this conversation differently. He, the savior, stands against the bloodsucking invader and frees his people. He never realized that the mirror had two sides. Linder was just a broken man, used by the system, much like himself. The devils responsible for everything that happened were safe in Berlin or buried underground. His city, the beautiful Szczecin, has played only a minor role in the complex game of international politics.\n\nAnd what should I do with you, huh? As I mentioned, I accept full responsibility for my actions during the occupation of Szczecin. Please, I was only a mere pawn in all this. I want to go home. I wish I had not left Germany and had returned to Wuppertal. I miss my country, Piotr.\n\nKrzystek thought for a while. Is it just to punish a man who only desires to visit his home? Is it fair to deny the people a sense of justice? Every decision seems to have its drawbacks. After deep calculations, he was confident about what to do."

Here are the details, Mr. President. - The man said placing a file on Krzystek's desk - The Vikings made a critical mistake demanding jewelry instead of banknotes. The coffers with valuables were too heavy to effectively transport them during their retreat on the few remaining ships.\nHe couldn't hide his amusement. Krzystek answered with an encouraging smile.\n - You're dismissed.\n\nHaving been left alone, Krzystek sat in the most comfortable pose he could achieve in his office. Things were better than expected. He never thought they would retrieve loot taken by the Danes. Already, his mind painted the prospects of developing Szczecin with the additional funds concentrated in his hands. Of course, after the president rewards himself for the way his impeccable rule enabled such a superb execution of this military operation that retrieved the people's money back to Szczecin...\n- Oh, right. The people - Krzystek brought himself down to earth.\nHe could hide the fact that those stolen goods belonged to his citizens. And the fact Danegeld functioned more or less like a tax and extensive documentation showed who lost what and now everybody could easily issue a claim to the jewelry or money we retrieved.\n - Perhaps, I could hide the fact we retrieved the valuables. - Not that he was against giving people their rightful possessions. Krzystek just wanted to explore all the angles of the situation. - No, too dangerous.\nThe people would be disappointed that the recent war gave them nothing. And hiding such treasure would involve black market shenanigans and that could be quickly uncovered by the press, either independently or with the help of...\n - The Guild - The companies would surely want a piece of that cake for their 'noble' help in overthrowing the German occupation. Of course, if I gave the money to myself they'd pay up the press agencies to milk the topic to hell and back.

szczecin.10.desc: "Their success has been quite surprising. Due to political pressure, the brass issued an order for a single infantry battalion to commence a risky attack against the enemy capital of Koszalin. In spite of the unsupplanted battlefield losses and the fact their lieutenant colonel had fallen ill, the determined unit under its acting commander, Major Robert Rosiak, achieved their objective. As soon as the Szczecinian soldiers saw the Koszalin city sign with 'Basketline' ridiculously sprayed all over it, the Kolonkists raised the white flag. Major remained at a safe distance as his soldiers marched into the town to disarm their adversaries.\n Colonel wanted to burn the city for the raids against civilian property conducted by Polish-Americans. It was merely a suggestion and not a direct order. And the Colonel was not here. Rosiak wanted the occupation to be as smooth and civilized as possible. He wasn't prone to vengeful actions and was of the opinion that early acts of surrender shouldn't be punished by needless violence. If possible he wanted to be remembered as a benign liberator and at the time it seemed doable. So doable that the officer decided to celebrate the incoming victory with a quick smoke. He reached for his favorite Winstons. His wife was always complaining to him about his supposed addiction and asked him to get through at least one day without a single cigarette. Mrs. Rosiak's wish was about to come true though unfortunately not because of the reasons she desired as the major's hand wasn't stopped by his conscience, but by a sharpshooter's shot that hit the officer's arm. Second later, Kolonkist soldiers hidden in the homes opened fire at the Szczecinian battalion. In their last stand, the Americans decided to go down with dishonor. Rosiak fell to the floor of his military jeep. His adjutant immediately approached him after signaling the medics.\n - And to think, I wanted to spare those bastards - Rosiak muttered to himself as his uniform turned redder and redder from his own blood.\n Other soldiers formed a defensive formation around his car providing covering fire as the major was being taken behind the car to be bandaged.\n- Captain - Rosiak wanted to quickly give one last order before being transported to the medical tent - Burn them. Burn all of the government buildings. Don't touch civilian buildings.\nThe defenders forced his hand. Now he had to give this order. He was afraid his own soldiers would torch the city no matter what order he would give. Trying to stem them would only create division among ranks and potential mutiny. The anger of his men couldn't stopped, but Rosiak hoped that thanks to his conditional approval, it could be contained.\n\nAfter the definite pacification of enemy soldiers, the vindictive Szczecinians set ablaze city hall, delegature of voivodeship office and district court. Their white walls soon turned to charcoal black as soldiers cheered at the sight. Still, they listened to their wounded commander's instructions and tried to prevent the fire from consuming the housing district. With mixed results."

In a place where everyone hates him and wishes him death. Alone, among the wolves. The seeming peace seen outside was only a facade. The order that he had imposed was already gone. Although with the constant pressure from Berlin and this traitorous smuck Tusk, he sometimes found moments of peace. Such like this. Outside, life went as usual. Like the hell of the past years, have never actually happened.\n\nIf someone had thought Lindner was fond of the idea of the German intervention, he would have been far from the truth. He never fully supported it. Some speculate that this was the thing that got him here, speaking against those who were higher than him. Deep inside, he knew about his wrongdoings. Poles wanted freedom, which he perfectly understood. His actual desire was to return home, visit the Bundestag, and wander through the streets of Berlin. \n\nBut his dreams and personal views were irrelevant. He had to impose order or end up worse than in the position of Eurogouverneur. This so-called Griffin Guard was a significant ick for him. Another problem was the blood-sucking Hanseatic Guild. Surrounded by enemies everywhere, his power was limited. Krzystek's clique had silent approval and support from the general population, and the resources were too scarce to diminish this threat. Guild, on the other hand, had total control over the state's economy and could shuffle him whenever they wanted. \n\nHis inner peace was no more. Dark thoughts overcame Lindner's mind. Christian extinguished his cigar and slowly walked over to his desk. A load of various reports was already there. He briefly riffled through them with boredom. Military posts attacked there, supply lines disrupted elsewhere - only the worst news, as always. In Stettin, only the most atrocious things can happen to me - Lindner thought. After finishing the reports, before even getting a chance to take a short break to rest, he heard a persistent knock on the door. \n\nIt was his closest ally, Herman Otto Soms. It was a short conversation. Even if Lindner considered a chance to keep peace in Stettin, now he knows his every move is meaningless. At least they have been notified about Germany's intention to abandon Eurokommisariats. After Soms left, he poured himself a glass of whisky, likely left by Krzystek. He must have found joy in governing this city; he never opened it - Lindner murmured to himself. Abandoned by his own country, Christian finally realized how his predecessor felt. There was no hope for him. He had no chance to see his beloved fatherland once again. He knew that judgment day was just around the corner. \n\nHe was ready."

He had inflicted too much pain on the citizens of Szczecin, and his actions had led to the deaths of many, including his people. Therefore, it did not shock him when Piotr Krzystek decided that fateful night to imprison him and hold him accountable for his crimes. In Krzystek's position, he would have done the same. Yet, acknowledging his mistakes did not erase his longing for his homeland. Christian wanted desperately to see Wuppertal again, but that possibility no longer existed.\n\nHe was being held on Kaszubska Street. The cell was cramped and reeking of damp concrete, a far cry from the spacious halls and well-furnished apartments Lindner had once called home. Two days had passed since they threw him in here. They fed him, yes, but only the bare minimum, just enough to keep him upright. No one had told him when his trial would begin. That was deliberate. The uncertainty was a tactic, designed to keep him anxious, off balance, constantly bracing for the sound of footsteps in the corridor. Nevertheless, Christian knew it would not take them too long to finally get rid of him.\n\nIronically, just as the thought crossed his mind, the door of his cell creaked open. Two broad-shouldered guards stepped in and wordlessly hauled him to his feet. As they marched him through the prison corridors, the Polish inmates jeered from behind the bars, hurling insults and mockery with twisted delight. He kept his head down, jaw clenched.\nThey shoved him into a van with blacked-out windows. The engine roared to life, and they drove through the city. Somehow, word must have gotten out, because people had gathered along the streets, shouting, spitting, and screaming slurs as the vehicle passed. It was not a regular transfer. It was a parade of humiliation of Christian.\n\nSuddenly, as they crossed Grunwaldzki Square, gunshots rang out. The van swerved violently as the driver lost control, slamming into a streetlamp with a metallic crunch. Lindner was thrown forward, his head colliding hard with the divider. Pain bloomed instantly, and the world spun in a chaotic blur of noise and motion. Dazed and bleeding, he barely registered the rear doors being torn open. Masked men dragged him out into the open before he could comprehend what was happening. Everything was spinning, and then, darkness.\n\nWhen he regained consciousness, he found himself seated beside armed men, their faces cold and unreadable. Every question he asked was met with silence; they did not even glance his way. Their focus was singular: escorting their prisoner. A creeping dread settled in Lindner’s chest. He did not know what had happened, but every instinct told him it was not good.\nAs the van sped down the road, he caught sight of a road sign through the window. The letters were all too familiar:\nPolice – 5 km.\nHe had a sinking feeling it would be the end of the road, in more ways than one."

Spain?\n\nHe had gotten used to the strict rationing regulations under Eurokomissariat rule, and whatever a Polish citizen might’ve been able to get for their lot was generally the dubious scraps off the tables of the other Europuppets… but they worked… alright? Alright was probably the best he was willing to give it. Same with sourcing everything locally after the Hansezirkel collapsed… but now? Looking at these products, pasta, ham, even a chocolate bar or two, plastered with well-known logos and flags of nations the Polish could barely dream of traveling to made him think two things. For one, what kind of wizardry did those corpos use to supply all this into this region of the world? And for two, well…\n\n“What the hell am I going to get?”\n\nWhen he returned home, he was greeted to, as always, his wife. Mistrustful as ever, though some would say for good reason, she dove into the shopping bag of her husband with the swiftness of a dolphin, and there she found something which she at the same time had and hadn’t expected. While she was used to her husband spending… a little more than expected, usually on a little cheap wine, this was an especially egregious case. Laid out in the bag was a smorgasbord of products with enough multinational markings on them to simulate touring the world three times over. Irish butter, exotic french cheese, various kinds of Mediterranean ham, it was a sight to behold for sure.\n\n“Where in the name of Christ did you get all this?”, she questioned him, clearly agitated.\n\n“I… Netto!”, he answered after a bit of struggle. She was probably just as surprised as he was in the store, he thought. But hey! There was never a better time to check if they liked blue cheese-\n\n“Bullshit, Netto doesn’t sell this kind of stuff, and if they do, probably cost a fortune… oh, and let’s not forget that you didn’t get any buns, ketchup, tea…”, as she went on, Jarosław felt the feeling sink in. The embarrassment made him want to tie a stone around his neck and drown himself in the Baltic. But… could have anyone he knew resisted in his place?"

szczecin.47.desc: "We called it a patrol, but it was never meant to be.\n\nEight of us moved single-file through the marshes somewhere north of Stare Drawsko, with muck sucking at our boots and rifles clenched in sweating hands. The rain hadn't stopped in days, and the fog was thick enough to choke. Somewhere above, a drone buzzed like a fly over a corpse, but in that damned wetland, eyes meant nothing. They were already watching us. I remember Sergeant Wilczek whispering, “Keep tight. Too quiet”. That was a minute before his head exploded. Just gone. One second he was there, mouth open mid-word, and then he was a stump spraying pink mist.\n\nThen the world erupted. The Lizards hit us like ghosts, crawling from the water, the reeds, the goddamn trees. Camouflaged like moss and muck, their eyes gleamed behind homemade gas masks shaped like wolf snouts. The first volley of arrows and bullets cut down Janek and Bartek - Bartek didn't even scream, just slipped under the water like it was pulling him home. We fired blindly. Return fire in a foggy hell. A flamethrower lit up the mist, but all it caught was a tree - and then the tree caught us. Burning bark and screaming filled the air. I ran. I don't remember choosing to, but my legs moved. Beside me, Piotrek tripped and screamed as something dragged him by the ankle into the reeds. His scream cut off with a wet crunch.\n\nWe regrouped - what was left of us. Four out of eight. Dawid was muttering prayers between sobs. They didn't chase us. They hunted us. Slow. Patient. One by one. We'd see movement, open fire, then nothing but silence. And then, the howling. God-damned howling. Minutes later, we'd find another one gone. I saw Kazek go down to a pit lined with sharpened rebar - one moment he was there, then the ground swallowed him. We couldn't even pull him out. We tried.\n\nI crawled God knows how long on my stomach, drenched in blood and swamp water, until I hit the edge of the patrol perimeter. The extraction team found me, but I could only mutter about hell. Of eight, three came back breathing. One shot himself the next day. They called us soldiers of Szczecin, but we were just amateurs in old uniforms pretending to be someone we're not. And they, those freaks, those monsters, howling through the fog - were home in that place.\n\nWe called it a patrol. We were trespassing.\n\n And wolves don't forgive trespassers. Not anymore. Not since the Lizard Union claimed our fate."

szczecin.54.desc: "Christian Lindner still could not believe that Krzystek had decided to let him go. As he sat in the apartment provided to him after the events at the city hall, he wondered why someone who had suffered so much because of him would casually allow him to return to Germany. Lindner imagined various outcomes of the revolution, fearing that he would be persecuted and eventually hanged for his crimes. Yet, here he was, waiting i his former apartment for transport to the German border.\n\nHe knew nothing was waiting for him there. His failures sealed his fate; no one would ever trust him with real power again. To his people, he was a disgrace, the man who had lost the city that had begun to feel German once more. And yet, to his surprise, he didn’t care.\nLeadership had never truly suited Christian. He was never seen as the ideal chairman of the Free Democratic Party, nor a particularly capable Eurogovernor of Szczecin. That was his exit, his chance to leave behind the cesspit of politics for good. He could live in a small home in Wuppertal, do gardening, and enjoy life. A peace he had longed for many years.\n\n His daydreaming was cut short by a sharp, persistent knock at the door. When he opened it, two Griffin soldiers stood before him.\n“Your transport is ready,” one of them said. “It’s time.”\n\nWithout a word, Christian picked up the small handbag containing the few belongings he was permitted to take. He took the last glance at the apartment in central Szczecin, once his home, now just another space waiting for another citizen to live in, and stepped out into the corridor, leaving it all behind.\n\nChristian sat silently in the back seat as the car rolled through Szczecin. The city was already settling into its rhythms, but the scars of the revolution were still raw, shattered windows, scorched walls, and streets that remembered too much. So many had died for nothing, clinging to a cause that had been lost long before the first shots were fired.\nYet something had changed. The usual gloom that clung to Szczecin seemed to have lifted. People looked lighter, freer, almost happy. It was then that Lindner realized, with bitter clarity, that he had been the villain in their story all along, not any officer or soldier, but him.\nAfter a brief drive, they reached the Lubieszyn-Linken border crossing. To Lindner's surprise, Piotr Krzystek was already there, waiting. On the other side, a small unit of German soldiers stood in formation, ready to receive and take him somewhere only they knew. Lindner stepped out of the car and walked toward the crossing. But just before the threshold, he paused. Turning back, he met Krzystek’s gaze, steady, unreadable.\n“Danke schön” Lindner said softly. Then he turned, crossed the border, and nodded to his German comrades. Without ceremony, he climbed into the waiting vehicle and disappeared toward Berlin. Piotr stood still, watching the convoy fade into the horizon. Only one thought echoed in his mind:"
