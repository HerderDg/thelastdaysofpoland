STE_loza_biznesmenow_desc: "TBD"
STE_piotr_krzystek_desc:"Elected as Mayor of Szczecin all the way back in 2006, Piotr Krzystek has been resisting against PiS policies alongside with his contemporary mayors from other western cities. After falling out of grace with Donald Tusk in 2010, he was a bulwark of nonpartisanship on the edge of a tempestous political storm that took over Poland, especially when Warsaw sent the military to put down riots in 2025.\n\nUpon the announcement of the Eurokorps intervention on request of Tusk, unnotified Krzystek welcomed the mainly German troops in the city. On one hand, his ideology gravitated way closer to Berlin than to Warsaw, on the other, the geographical location of Szczecin so close to the German border put in a precarious position, so the intervention was welcomed without resistance. However what was meant to be a peaceful operation, soon turned to be an all out war with the loyalist units of the Polish army.\n\nKrzystek was deposed from his position as situation on the front worsened. The new German administration called it "prevention from a possible local insurgency", but in his mind it was surely a petty revenge from Tusk. The ex-mayor went into hiding and formed an underground resistance group, the Griffin Guard, with the aim to depose the occupying German forces.\n\nNow, after months of conflict with local authorities, with support from two out of three Hanza corporations, victory has finally been achieved. As the Eurokorps retreated, the Gryphon flies over Szczecin once more. Now Krzystek, as the leader of a Western Pomeranian powerhouse can consolidate his rule and his loyal populace can finally live free from mistakes of both Warsaw and Berlin."
STE_lindner_desc: "The leader of the Freie Demokratische Partei and former Minister of Finance of the Eurostaat, upon less than fruitful power struggles in Berlin on the eve of the intervention, has been appointed the Gouverneur of the Free City of Stettin. Whether the move was truly a promotion, as the lavish ceremony at the old Pomeranian Dukes' castle would seem to suggest, or simply a punishment for speaking out too loudly against his colleagues' actions during the operation remains unknown, at least officially; however, being pushed aside, thrown out from the halls of the Bundestag to guard an unwilling prize of a conflict he personally opposed has left Christian Lindner feeling strongly embittered towards his compatriots in Berlin.\n\nHaving found himself in the land of his ancestors, the new governor is trying desperately to maintain order and bring prosperity to the Lübeck of Vorpommern, yet constant protests and insurgent activities of the Polish citizenry make the process all but easy. Desperate to ascertain a modicum of autonomy from the controlling grasp of Eurokommissariat Westpolen and too proud to rely on aid from those who spurned him, Lindner has been forced to make pragmatic deals with those he was supposed to govern with a strong hand, stacking his administration with advisors from the region's influential corporations: Polsteam, Netto, and Chemiewerke Pölitz.\n\nWhile Lindner hoped that the considerable economic privileges granted to the local companies would help him maintain order, he soon found himself backed into yet another corner. Seeing the influence they could yield if they combined their operations, the Big Three joined forces, forming the Hanseatic Guild - an organization that quickly established an oligopoly on the city's whole financial sector, effectively tying the noose on which to hang the governor should he ever step out of line.\n\nPlagued with violent insurgents, hordes of protesters, and ruthless capitalists, Lindner's administration stands, at best, on dangerously shaky ground. For now, the Stadtpolizei, with middling support from the local garrison of Eurokorps from Eurokommissariat Westpolen, maintains the fragile peace, or at least the illusion thereof, but it remains to be seen whether this balance shall hold, or if, just like when German formations rolled through Polish soil, Stettin is doomed to be the first domino to fall."

STE_griffon_partisans: "The Griffon Guerilla"
STE_griffon_partisans_desc: "The city of Stettin is plagued with countless bands of insurgents who sabotage the regime at just about every level of operation. Subversive activity ranges from plastering public spaces with anti-government flyers and indiscriminate vandalism to, at times, an armed militia that often clashes with the local police forces. The Stadtpolizei is spread thin trying to put out the fires of rebellion, but just like a hydra, one flame extinguished causes two more to start elsewhere. Backed against the increasingly enclosing walls, Lindner's administration is struggling to get anything done in the current situation."
STE_anti_partisan: "Anti-Guerilla Operations"
STE_anti_partisan_desc: "The recent influx of fresh officers and newly ingrained zeal in the form of various overly generous bonuses have allowed the Stadtpolizei to resist and push back against local insurgencies. With the tide turning in favor of the government, a large-scale witch hunt spearheaded by the Eurokorps has begun across the entire city and its surroundings to snuff out any remaining forms of organized resistance. Lindner's administration is hopeful that this final crackdown will be enough to quell the rebellious spirit of the populace."
STE_zamek_idea: "Conservative-Liberal Union 'Castle'"
STE_unia_idea: "Summer Union"
##First Tree##
STE_so_ist_leben: "So ist das Leben"
STE_so_ist_leben_desc: "Standing by the window in his office at the city hall, Christian Lindner, the man tasked with governing this bustling trade hub of a coastal metropolis, was deeply immersed in his observations. On the street level, he could see simple, cheerful people about their daily lives, enjoying and cherishing boons provided by the Bundesrepublik. He sighed with glee as he watched a fresh delivery to his favourite cafe, then turned to his assistant.\n\n- Lübeck is so beautiful at this time of year, don't you think Hermann?\n- Sir, it's Stettin.\n- Shut up Hermann.\n"

STE_wild_goose_chase: "Wild Goose Chase"
STE_wild_goose_chase_desc: "We've recieved a report from a Stadtpolizei commandant, which indicates that there are insurgents ammasing in the allotment gardens of Krzekowo. Source of this information is unknown, however Stadtpolizei is ready and able to send a squad to investigate this situation, in case the report is genuine."
STE_fortify_buildings: "Fortify Government Buildings"
STE_fortify_buildings_desc: "The pushback against recent policies and actions has been greater than expected. Angry mobs of disgruntled citizens have started forming around both government and police buildings. To maintain order without escalating the conflict, we should request the Stadtpolizei to establish fortifications, put up planks in windows and set up sandbags. A few rolls of barbed wire wouldn't hurt either."
STE_call_reinforcements: "Call For Reinforcements"
STE_call_reinforcements_desc: "With growing unrest within and around the city, Stadtpolizei headquarters report that their officers are spread too thin. Policemen are simply unable to respond to all calls against anti-government hooligans. The Inspector has voiced concerns and asked for support from the Eurokommisariat command, military action is required to maintain control."
STE_insurgent_whackamole: "Insurgent Whack-a-mole"
STE_insurgent_whackamole_desc: "Tonight was a nightmare for the entire Stettin Stadtpolizei. Seemingly across the entire city, groups of hooligans banded together and performed acts of synchronised vandalism on government related buildings. Police already spread thin, fell completely disorganised. Morning sun shown the full extent of hooliganism, including but not limited to caricature posters of Lindner in the city center, police cars with broken windows and eurokommisariat supply trucks vandalised and robbed clean. However the most prominent "artpiece" is a massive graffiti on the city hall's wall saying "Lindner wypierdalać"."
STE_smoke_them_out: "Smoke Them Out"
STE_smoke_them_out_desc: "It's time to show the hooligans who's riding this thing. Stadtpolizei with Eurokorps support has been rallied and outfitted for full counter-insurgent shakedown. Each suburban house will be checked, all forests will be searched thoroughly, no stone will be left unturned. This certainly will be an unpopular decision, but surely faithful and loyal citizens that have nothing to hide won't mind a justified search."
STE_ausweiss_bitte: "Ausweiss Bitte"
STE_ausweiss_bitte_desc: "Ever since the intervention, Szczecin has been divided into two halves along the Oder river - the right bank under Eurokommisariat Westpolen and left bank under the new administration of Christian Lindner. With the insurgent situation worsening by the day, bridges have been turned into highly restricted military checkpoints. "
STE_scold_companies: "Scold the Companies"
STE_scold_companies_desc: "Governor Lindner was deeply engulfed in his thoughts sitting at his desk, pen in hand, in front of an empty piece of paper.\n\n- "Dear entrepreneurs"... no no no, this has to be more stern, but... not too stern...\n- Sir, you've been sitting over this paper for over 7 hours now.\n- Oh! Hermann, make yourself useful, tell me how to start this letter.\n- Is it about the corporations again, sir?\n- Yes! They don't take me seriously! ME! Christian Lindner! All those hyenas just want to bleed me dry!\n- Aren't you the one to invite them to the city, sir?\n- Shut up, Hermann... "I hereby declare"... no not like that...\n"
STE_word_from_sponsors: "Word From Our Sponsors"
STE_word_from_sponsors_desc: "In todays 7 o'clock news: Christian Lindner's strong worded letter to the Hanzeatic Guild chairmen has leaked, in it he speaks of lack of respect for his position as governor. Will growing tensions in the highest positions of power rock Stettin in its foundations? Stay with us for full coverage of the letter, and now a word from our sponsors - the Hanzeatic Guild."
STE_hall_of_the_mountain_king: "Claws of the Griffon"
STE_hall_of_the_mountain_king_desc: "Sun rose slowly above Stettin accompanied by birds singing, but also blaring air raid sirens piercing the air. Governor Lindner was awaken from his sleep by a ringing red phone on his night stand. Once he recovered from the initial shock, he immediately picked it up.\n\n- Lindner here.\n- Governor! The insurgents! They're everywhere!\n- Hermann? What's going on, Westpolen troops were keeping the order fine.\n- They... They are gone, Governor, recalled by Tusk!\n- Mein Gott...\n\nHe quickly rushed to the window of his apartment overseeing the city. To his shock, the right bank of the Oder was in chaos, with countless pillars of dark smoke rising to the sky. To his dismay, one thing was sticking out of the darkness... a flag with a red griffon upon it."
STE_hanse_brucke_falling: "Hansa-Brücke is Falling"
STE_hanse_brucke_falling_desc: "As insurgent troops amassed in front of the city hall, last soldiers and policemen that remained loyal quickly barricaded the main entrance. Governor Lindner could be found in a messy suit, running across his office with a big bucket.\n\n- Sir? Why the bucket?\n- Shut up Hermann.\n\nQuickly, he began to throw documents and papers into the bucket, then setting them aflame.\n\n- Come on Hermann, help me, before our convoy comes!\n- Sir... They aren't coming.\n- What? What about our Hansa allies?\n- Netto and Polsteam turned coat, sir.\n- Quick, get me the Chemiewerke CEO then.\n- He's... in Pölitz already, along with the rest of Eurokorps, sir.\n- Scheisse...\n\nGovernor with his assistant stood in the glow of the flaming bucket, as the main doors to the city hall have fallen..."

unification.74.t: "[GetNewspaper]Szczecin unifies West Pomerania!"
unification.74.desc: "In West Pomerania, the stories of the old Hansa never truly died. For some, they proved to be the inspiration for their greatest struggle yet. In an unprecedented display of cooperation, the major corporations of Szczecin banded together, forming a council akin to the former merchant republics. Combining their strengths, they quickly overpowered both the remnants of Tusk’s forces, as well as all other contenders for regional dominance. The confederation now faces its greatest test, as no longer bound by a common enemy, the corporations act independently once more, often in open competition and defiance of existing agreements. For the continued survival of the republic, the currently loose central authority of the council will have to be greatly strengthened, or else conflicting business interests will tear the fledgling state apart before it could even truly get off the ground."
