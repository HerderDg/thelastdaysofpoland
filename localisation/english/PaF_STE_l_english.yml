STE_so_ist_leben: "So ist das Leben"
STE_so_ist_leben_desc: "Standing by the window in his office at the city hall, Christian Lindner, the man tasked with governing this bustling trade hub of a coastal metropolis, was deeply immersed in his observations. On the street level, he could see simple, cheerful people about their daily lives, enjoying and cherishing boons provided by the Bundesrepublik. He sighed with glee as he watched a fresh delivery to his favourite cafe, then turned to his assistant.\n\n- Lübeck is so beautiful at this time of year, don't you think Hermann?\n- Sir, it's Stettin.\n- Shut up Hermann.\n"

STE_wild_goose_chase: "Wild Goose Chase"
STE_wild_goose_chase_desc: "We've recieved a report from a Stadtpolizei commandant, which indicates that there are insurgents ammasing in the allotment gardens of Krzekowo. Source of this information is unknown, however Stadtpolizei is ready and able to send a squad to investigate this situation, in case the report is genuine."
STE_fortify_buildings: "Fortify Government Buildings"
STE_fortify_buildings_desc: "The pushback against recent policies and actions has been greater than expected. Angry mobs of disgruntled citizens have started forming around both government and police buildings. To maintain order without escalating the conflict, we should request the Stadtpolizei to establish fortifications, put up planks in windows and set up sandbags. A few rolls of barbed wire wouldn't hurt either."
STE_call_reinforcements: "Call For Reinforcements"
STE_call_reinforcements_desc: "With growing unrest within and around the city, Stadtpolizei headquarters report that their officers are spread too thin. Policemen are simply unable to respond to all calls against anti-government hooligans. The Inspector has voiced concerns and asked for support from the Eurokommisariat command, military action is required to maintain control."
STE_insurgent_whackamole: "Insurgent Whack-a-mole"
STE_insurgent_whackamole_desc: "Tonight was a nightmare for the entire Stettin Stadtpolizei. Seemingly across the entire city, groups of hooligans banded together and performed acts of synchronised vandalism on government related buildings. Police already spread thin, fell completely disorganised. Morning sun shown the full extent of hooliganism, including but not limited to caricature posters of Lindner in the city center, police cars with broken windows and eurokommisariat supply trucks vandalised and robbed clean. However the most prominent "artpiece" is a massive graffiti on the city hall's wall saying "Lindner wypierdalać"."
STE_smoke_them_out: "Smoke Them Out"
STE_smoke_them_out_desc: "It's time to show the hooligans who's riding this thing. Stadtpolizei with Eurokorps support has been rallied and outfitted for full counter-insurgent shakedown. Each suburban house will be checked, all forests will be searched thoroughly, no stone will be left unturned. This certainly will be an unpopular decision, but surely faithful and loyal citizens that have nothing to hide won't mind a justified search."
STE_ausweiss_bitte: "Ausweiss Bitte"
STE_ausweiss_bitte_desc: "Ever since the intervention, Szczecin has been divided into two halves along the Oder river - the right bank under Eurokommisariat Westpolen and left bank under the new administration of Christian Lindner. With the insurgent situation worsening by the day, bridges have been turned into highly restricted military checkpoints. "
STE_scold_companies: "Scold The Companies"
STE_scold_companies_desc: "Governor Lindner was deeply engulfed in his thoughts sitting at his desk, pen in hand, in front of an empty piece of paper.\n\n- "Dear entrepreneurs"... no no no, this has to be more stern, but... not too stern...\n- Sir, you've been sitting over this paper for over 7 hours now.\n- Oh! Hermann, make yourself useful, tell me how to start this letter.\n- Is it about the corporations again, sir?\n- Yes! They don't take me seriously! ME! Christian Lindner! All those hyenas just want to bleed me dry!\n- Aren't you the one to invite them to the city, sir?\n- Shut up, Hermann... "I hereby declare"... no not like that...\n"
STE_word_from_sponsors: "Word From Our Sponsors"
STE_word_from_sponsors_desc: "In todays 7 o'clock news: Christian Lindner's strong worded letter to the Hanzeatic Guild chairmen has leaked, in it he speaks of lack of respect for his position as governor. Will growing tensions in the highest positions of power rock Stettin in its foundations? Stay with us for full coverage of the letter, and now a word from our sponsors - the Hanzeatic Guild."
STE_hall_of_the_mountain_king: "Claws of The Griffon"
STE_hall_of_the_mountain_king_desc: "Sun rose slowly above Stettin accompanied by birds singing, but also blaring air raid sirens piercing the air. Governor Lindner was awaken from his sleep by a ringing red phone on his night stand. Once he recovered from the initial shock, he immediately picked it up.\n\n- Lindner here.\n- Governor! The insurgents! They're everywhere!\n- Hermann? What's going on, Westpolen troops were keeping the order fine.\n- They... They are gone, Governor, recalled by Tusk!\n- Mein Gott...\n\nHe quickly rushed to the window of his apartment overseeing the city. To his shock, the right bank of the Oder was in chaos, with countless pillars of dark smoke rising to the sky. To his dismay, one thing was sticking out of the darkness... a flag with a red griffon upon it."
STE_hanse_brucke_falling: "Hansa-Brücke is Falling"
STE_hanse_brucke_falling_desc: "As insurgent troops amassed in front of the city hall, last soldiers and policemen that remained loyal quickly barricaded the main entrance. Governor Lindner could be found in a messy suit, running across his office with a big bucket.\n\n- Sir? Why the bucket?\n- Shut up Hermann.\n\nQuickly, he began to throw documents and papers into the bucket, then setting them aflame.\n\n- Come on Hermann, help me, before our convoy comes!\n- Sir... They aren't coming.\n- What? What about our Hansa allies?\n- Netto and Polsteam turned coat, sir.\n- Quick, get me the Chemiewerke CEO then.\n- He's... in Pölitz already, along with the rest of Eurokorps, sir.\n- Scheisse...\n\nGovernor with his assistant stood in the glow of the flaming bucket, as the main doors to the city hall have fallen..."

unification.74.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Merchant Republic of Szczecin unifies West Pomerania!"
unification.74.desc:0 "In West Pomerania, the stories of the old Hansa never truly died. For some, they proved to be the inspiration for their greatest struggle yet. In an unprecedented display of cooperation, the major corporations of Szczecin banded together, forming a council akin to the former merchant republics. Combining their strengths, they quickly overpowered both the remnants of Tusk’s forces, as well as all other contenders for regional dominance. The confederation now faces its greatest test, as no longer bound by a common enemy, the corporations act independently once more, often in open competition and defiance of existing agreements. For the continued survival of the republic, the currently loose central authority of the council will have to be greatly strengthened, or else conflicting business interests will tear the fledgling state apart before it could even truly get off the ground."
