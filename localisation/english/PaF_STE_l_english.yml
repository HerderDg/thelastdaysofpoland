STE_loza_biznesmenow_desc: "TBD"
STE_piotr_krzystek_desc:"Elected as Mayor of Szczecin all the way back in 2006, Piotr Krzystek has been resisting against PiS policies alongside with his contemporary mayors from other western cities. After falling out of grace with Donald Tusk in 2010, he was a bulwark of nonpartisanship on the edge of a tempestous political storm that took over Poland, especially when Warsaw sent the military to put down riots in 2025.\n\nUpon the announcement of the Eurokorps intervention on request of Tusk, unnotified Krzystek welcomed the mainly German troops in the city. On one hand, his ideology gravitated way closer to Berlin than to Warsaw, on the other, the geographical location of Szczecin so close to the German border put it in a precarious position, so the intervention was welcomed without resistance. However what was meant to be a peaceful operation, soon turned to be an all out war with the loyalist units of the Polish army.\n\nKrzystek was deposed from his position as situation on the front worsened. The new German administration called it "prevention from a possible local insurgency", but in his mind it was surely a petty revenge from Tusk. The ex-mayor went into hiding and formed an underground resistance group, the Griffin Guard, with the aim to depose the occupying German forces.\n\nNow, after months of conflict with local authorities, with support from two out of three Hanza corporations, victory has finally been achieved. As the Eurokorps retreated, the Gryphon flies over Szczecin once more. Now Krzystek, as the leader of a Western Pomeranian powerhouse can consolidate his rule and his loyal populace can finally live free from mistakes of both Warsaw and Berlin."
STE_lindner_desc: "The leader of the Freie Demokratische Partei and former Minister of Finance of the Eurostaat, upon less than fruitful power struggles in Berlin on the eve of the intervention, has been appointed the Gouverneur of the Free City of Stettin. Whether the move was truly a promotion, as the lavish ceremony at the old Pomeranian Dukes' castle would seem to suggest, or simply a punishment for speaking out too loudly against his colleagues' actions during the operation remains unknown, at least officially; however, being pushed aside, thrown out from the halls of the Bundestag to guard an unwilling prize of a conflict he personally opposed has left Christian Lindner feeling strongly embittered towards his compatriots in Berlin.\n\nHaving found himself in the land of his ancestors, the new governor is trying desperately to maintain order and bring prosperity to the Lübeck of Vorpommern, yet constant protests and insurgent activities of the Polish citizenry make the process all but easy. Desperate to ascertain a modicum of autonomy from the controlling grasp of Eurokommissariat Westpolen and too proud to rely on aid from those who spurned him, Lindner has been forced to make pragmatic deals with those he was supposed to govern with a strong hand, stacking his administration with advisors from the region's influential corporations: Polsteam, Netto, and Chemiewerke Pölitz.\n\nWhile Lindner hoped that the considerable economic privileges granted to the local companies would help him maintain order, he soon found himself backed into yet another corner. Seeing the influence they could yield if they combined their operations, the Big Three joined forces, forming the Hanseatic Guild - an organization that quickly established an oligopoly on the city's whole financial sector, effectively tying the noose on which to hang the governor should he ever step out of line.\n\nPlagued with violent insurgents, hordes of protesters, and ruthless capitalists, Lindner's administration stands, at best, on dangerously shaky ground. For now, the Stadtpolizei, with middling support from the local garrison of Eurokorps from Eurokommissariat Westpolen, maintains the fragile peace, or at least the illusion thereof, but it remains to be seen whether this balance shall hold, or if, just like when German formations rolled through Polish soil, Stettin is doomed to be the first domino to fall."

STE_griffon_partisans: "The Griffon Guerilla"
STE_griffon_partisans_desc: "The city of Stettin is plagued with countless bands of insurgents who sabotage the regime at just about every level of operation. Subversive activity ranges from plastering public spaces with anti-government flyers and indiscriminate vandalism to, at times, an armed militia that often clashes with the local police forces. The Stadtpolizei is spread thin trying to put out the fires of rebellion, but just like a hydra, one flame extinguished causes two more to start elsewhere. Backed against the increasingly enclosing walls, we are struggling to get anything done in the current situation."
STE_anti_partisan: "Anti-Guerilla Operations"
STE_anti_partisan_desc: "The recent influx of fresh officers and newly ingrained zeal in the form of various overly generous bonuses have allowed the Stadtpolizei to resist and push back against local insurgencies. With the tide turning in favor of the government, a large-scale witch hunt spearheaded by the Eurokorps has begun across the entire city and its surroundings to snuff out any remaining forms of organized resistance. Lindner's administration is hopeful that this final crackdown will be enough to quell the rebellious spirit of the populace."

The majority of the populace who took up arms in our quest for liberation has dispersed, returning to their homes and families.

We wouldn't be anywhere near as capable without their help, and for better or worse, our fates intertwine tighter and tighter. We might've signed a pact with the devil, however as long as the Hanseatic League sees us as a worthwhile partner, our war machine will remain financed and well oiled, able to put down our enemies. Such help is never without a cost however – and once the dust of war settles, we will surely be reminded of our side of this bargain."
STE_revolutionary_chaos: "Revolutionary Chaos"
STE_revolutionary_chaos_desc: "Since our successful liberation of Szczecin, revolutionary fervour made way to the wish for a return to normality. However, our northern frontiers are under constant pressure from the remaining Eurokorps, requiring a non-stop attention from our army, as well as law enforcement. The revolutionary power vacuum left many districts ridden with gangs and criminal syndicates which terrorise our citizens. Countless citizens don't have access to basic services and essential products. Our newly formed state is being stretched to its limits, we must quickly act to remedy the situation, before the loyalty of our people wavers."

STE_so_ist_leben_desc: "Dear Citizens Of Freie Stadt Stettin!\n\n Our beautiful city has faced problems caused by unlawful dissidents for many years. Theft, assassinations, and disruption of peace were caused by the enemies of the state, known as the Griffin Guard. You should not be fooled by their seemingly good intentions. The thing that they want is to mock the law and spark a rebellion.\n\n Our bravest sons protect the streets, households, and families from those brutes.

Last night, groups of hooligans across the city banded together and vandalized government buildings in a synchronized manner. Unknown destabilizing elements are suspected to be involved. The morning sun has shown the full extent of hooliganism, including but not limited to caricature posters of Eurogouvernor Lindner in the city center, police cars with broken windows, and Eurokommisariat supply trucks vandalized and robbed clean. However, the most prominent "art piece" is massive graffiti on the city hall's wall saying "Lindner wypierdalaj"; citizens who can identify potential suspects will receive a substantial reward.\n\n For Stettin!"

STE_scold_companies_desc: "Dear Citizens of Frei Stadt Stettin!\n\n Today marks an important event: Eurogouvernor Christian Lindner is meeting with leaders of the Hanseatic Guild. The subject of the discussions is unclear, but our reporters speculate that it is related to the recent activities of the anti-government group known as the Griffin Guard. Many believe that the future of our city depends on those talks. It is not a secret that the situation has been tense lately. From our secret contact, we know that the dissidents were targeting essential employees of Chemiewerke AG. These dangerous tendencies must be dealt with quickly.

In the letter, he expresses his concerns about the lack of respect for his position as governor. Lindner criticizes the fundamental principles that uphold our state. It is particularly concerning that the leader of our state is publicly attacking the Hanseatic Guild, which is the largest sponsor of our newspaper. We will closely watch the unfolding situation. We remind every citizen to report any suspicious activity.\n\n For Stettin!"

Everyone who will support that guerilla will be executed on the spot. Loyal citizens, we need to fight with those motherf *ripped in half*\n\nThere is no time to waste, dear Szczecinians!

STE_hanse_brucke_falling: "Hansa-Brücke is Falling"
STE_hanse_brucke_falling_desc: "Blood swept through the city of Szczecin. The old town, the gardens of Krzekowo, and the center were all submerged in violence. The people's anger after years of humiliation finally erupted. The judgment of the seemingly peaceful and quiet citizens was unforgiving. In just one night, the oppressors became the oppressed. Authority and law vanished completely. As the Germans evacuated, they left behind only massive chaos and disorganized administration. The city was abandoned, left to fend for itself.\n\n Only one person can save it: Piotr Krzystek and his Griffin Guard must clean up the chaos and restore the city's former glory. No one knows what another day will bring upon them.\n\n Szczecin's future lies in the hands of its people."

STE_i_vow_to_thee_desc: "Sun began to set over the city, as sounds of fighting slowly died out. Outside was illuminated only by burning piles of tyres, and torches held by jubilant insurgents. Inside the city hall, Piotr Krzystek made his way to his old office, after delegating his subordinates to capture all Eurokorps troopers and Policemen that surrendered. Greeted with a mess of papers and documents scaterred everywhere by the occupant governor, he sighed with a slight smile painting across his face. He was back home, where he belonged. Upon entering the balcony, crowd cheered his name.\n\n”People of Szczecin! We won! Today is the time to celebrate, for the occupation is no more. Go forth my friends and comrades, as tomorrow, we shall begin work on making this city, our city!”\n\nCrowds gathered upon the main square cheered loudly, waving their torches and improvised weapons. With a strong move, Krzystek broke off the German flag from the balcony and threw it down to the ground. Jubilant mob quickly ripped it and set the fragments aflame. Now, a new era begins for Szczecin, era of freedom."

STE_the_first_session_desc: "As the first gathering of the newly formed government of Szczecin drew closer and closer, grand preparations took place at the Chrobry Embankment. Within the walls of the Voivodeship Council house, Piotr Krzystek oversaw a grand refurbishment process to turn it into a prestigious building of the new parliament of the West Pomeranian metropolis. The largest room available was designated to be a gathering chamber, with seats for representatives from Summer and Castle factions on either side and the seat at the top reserved for the Leader himself. The building is now unrecognizable. While many see it as a new jewel of the city, others believe it may be a waste of public funds to create such an extravagant place."
STE_szczecin_charter: "The Szczecin Charter"
STE_szczecin_charter_desc: "Long days filled with loud speeches went by, as the first draft of the Szczecinian constitution was finally brought before the gathered representatives. President Krzystek stepped up to the speaker's pedestal, cleared his throat and held up the long, paper draft. His speech now broadcasted to all citizens of Szczecin.\n\n”Dear representatives, we discussed long, made promises and compromises, but now, with this charter of laws and rights, we can finally make this land, truly our own, for all people's of Szczecin.”\nHe set down the paper atop the pedestal, with a pen weighing it down. The leaders of each party took spots at his sides, glancing at each other as the President signed the charter. \n”Mr. Bogucki, Mr. Jaroszewicz, gentlemen, shall we?”\n\nFew seconds have passed in silence, as the two politicians gave each other glances of distrust, unable to decide who should go first. To break the stalemate, President produced a second pen from a pocket in his suit, giving one each. The two gentlemen signed the charter simultaneously, to a wide, standing applause across the room. With this concluded, Szczecin stands with it's own constitution, united as one."

unification.74.desc: "In West Pomerania, the stories of the old Hansa never truly died. For some, they proved to be the inspiration for their greatest struggle yet. In an unprecedented display of cooperation, the major corporations of Szczecin banded together, forming a council akin to the former merchant republics. Combining their strengths, they quickly overpowered both the remnants of Tusk’s forces, as well as all other contenders for regional dominance. The confederation now faces its greatest test, as no longer bound by a common enemy, the corporations act independently once more, often in open competition and defiance of existing agreements. For the continued survival of the republic, the currently loose central authority of the council will have to be greatly strengthened, or else conflicting business interests will tear the fledgling state apart before it could even truly get off the ground."

szczecin.1.t: "Promised Land"
szczecin.1.desc: "He slept, as he had no more strength to weep over his sorrow state. Although his dreams were blank, dark canvases for thoughts that couldn't form, he found serenity in them. For the first time in years, he was free. At least for as long as he could dream. Feeling nothing of his poor and dirty body, he has throw aside all known limits of his consciousness. He swam through the dark canvases. He visited the memories of his old home at Kościuszki st. He climbed on the old cornices of tenement houses, and then he jumped. He knew that the empty, concrete street below wouldn’t stop him from flying further into the dream. Into the never-ending space, pulsing with colours to the rhythm of his weak heart. At the end of it he hid in his room of confidence and safety. It was a literal imaginary room he often conjured up in his short sleep breaks. It helped him to hide form the cruel world since his middle school. Every time something bad happened, he went back to his home and hid his head into pillows, as if into proverbial sand. He was really good at daydreaming... but not this time.\n\nAnd then the sound screamed into his ears. It was a terrible, loud and silly jingle from his television he fell asleep in front of. Janusz opened his sore eyes, slowly but intensively feeling the increasing headache he was sentenced to. And sentenced he was rightfully, for his excessive alcohol consumption. His throat scratched without mercy, and the barely visible bottle of Paulaner still clenched in his hand appeared to be completely emptied. Just as the legion of similar ones, standing proudly around the old sofa Janusz was laid on, more like a dead body than an employee of the month. But still, even in his sorry state, he still was exactly that: recently named the best of the SEC's boiler stokers in Stettin. He had God given right to celebrate, as one of the few still valued poles in this once again german city. At least that's how it was in his mind. They might not pay him with the extra money he wants, but the shopping vouchers they threw at him, he eagerly spent to the last. Good thing the shop he used them at was not too picky on what exactly he could buy, or how much alcohol it had. He felt happy, or at least he wanted to. He needed a break though. His old body couldn't take another bottle of ambrosia, so all that was left was to just sit, wait, and watch the loud television in front of him. The sound and light from the Deutsche Welle programme filled his darkened room. And behind the flatscreen TV, there he was:\n\n"...indeed, your worries are over. As your appointed governor, I will continue to take care of the economic growth and integration of the city." - Christian Lindner spoke proudly. Janusz listened to the voice, whose haughty tone he already had time to get used to.\n"I promise you that from now on, this land and its people will only have good times ahead of them. There is much to be happy about..."\n\nUnfortunately, the next day the man was fired from his work. Had to make a place for someone younger and more able than him..."

szczecin.2.t: "Rude Interruption"
szczecin.2.desc: "A sunny day in Stettin. It was a perfect day to lay back and appreciate the civilizing aspect of the European peacekeeping mission. Unfortunately for Helmuth and his squadmates from the antiterrorist tactical unit, it was the day to answer the call of duty. A secret informant leaked information about a partisan hideout.\n - Ungrateful Poles - Helmuth thought to himself. Once again their pitiful Rzeczpospolita turned out to be a Saisonstaat and instead of being thankful for the professional and quick German help, they rebel against our benevolent administration.\n\n His team approached a position in Kreckow at the edges of Stettin. As was established by their intel, the suspects were hiding in the old World War 2 bunkers. As always Poles preferred nostalgia and pathos instead of functionality and discretion.  Each soldier assumed his position ensuring no traitor could escape or mount a successful counterattack. The commander gave a sign for Helmuth to approach the rebel base to estimate the danger. Quiet like a leopard, Helmut moved closer to the bunker's timeworn brick walls.\n'Strike the German!' 'Drive Fritzes away!' 'Shoot!' 'Shoot'!\nYoung policeman couldn't understand all the words being said. Nevertheless, he came to the frightening conclusion that the Poles in the bunker were ready to execute an innocent captured German settler. In a matter of milliseconds, he gave the signal to the captain, who in turn authorized another member of the strike team to use gas grenades. \n - Get down on the ground! - the antiterrorists shouted in Polish once the grenades went off, throwing the suspects on the paved .\nFour men and one woman were apprehended. The base contained some sort of communication equipment with an independent energy source and a stash of Molotov cocktails. At least that could be determined with all this smoke around.\n What's weird, the criminals' victim was nowhere to be found. Come to think of it the terrorists weren't wearing any military gear or uniforms and they didn't seem to be in physical shape to live the demanding life of guerilla fighters. The dispersing of gas finally allowed policemen to realize what really happened. The communication equipment turned out to be self-repaired TV. The stash of Molotovs was in fact an enormous pile of bottles of moonshine. Helmuth, still cautious, approached the screen with his machine gun ready to fire. It turned out the Poles were just watching an archival Polish vs Germany match from 2014.\n - It's a drinking den. Not a rebel base. - the fresh recruit finally stated the obvious.\nNot long after one of the apprehended, free from the initial shock, began to explain the misunderstanding. Probably. Alcohol and burning rage made the rustling Polish language even more uncomprehensible.\n - We could still arrest them, sir. - Helmuth tried to salvage the situation. - Given the reports of rising Brzęczek partisan group deep in Poland, we could still file this under seditious activity.\n - No use - commander replied with a sigh - They're innocent. That'd only antagonize the Poles. Gentlemen, we're done here. Time to have a talk with guys from counter-intelligence."

szczecin.3.desc: "Jacek's heart raced like a car on a racetrack. That wasn't how it was supposed to be - he thought - as he fought through the dense Arkonian forest. The quick partisan action turned out to be a bloodbath. He heard the German soldiers catching up to him. He was scared. A few years before, he was an ordinary high school student with dreams, perspectives, and a bright future. When the collapse of Poland began, his stability was gone. After the unfortunate death of his parents during the German invasion, he was vengeful. Being a partisan eased up his pain.\n\nStill, after all, he was never ready for that. Their job primarily involved vandalizing government buildings and putting anti-Lidner posters within the city, which was substantially easy for them. He could potentially spend a few days in prison at most. He couldn't even imagine that they would shoot. Suddenly, he stumbled over an exposed tree root and fell. Jacek didn't know it was already over for him. When he got up and tried to overrun his tormentors, a bullet pierced his leg. \n\nHe let out a silent cry as he fell again. An unbearable pain spread throughout Jacek's entire body. As he endured this agony, his happiest memories flashed before his eyes. Beloved Kasia, vacations in Kołobrzeg with the long-gone parents, wandering through the streets of Szczecin with his classmates - it all seemed like a fever dream. Orders shouted by the captain of the approaching soldiers felt like a different realm. \n\nThe reality struck when a brutal German delivered a swift kick to his stomach. Jacek cought violently. And what do we have here? - the soldier spoke with arrogance combined with curiosity - another Polish scum?\n\Soldiers cornered the young partisan from every side.\n\nLet me handle this, Hans. The uncompromising voice spoke from behind as it quickly advanced to the scene. The German officer crouched before Jacek and looked directly into his eyes.\n\Hello, young boy. What is your name?\n\Jacek, sir - as he replied, his voice cracked in fear\n\I'm Colonel Helmuth Bluthgeld. I will be clear: your life depends entirely on your honesty with me in the coming moments.\n\Please tell me where your main base is, and I will let you go free. As simple as that - he smiled.\n\I dunno, sir; they never provided me with all the details.\n\nBluthgeld glanced at his band as if giving them a silent command.\n\ No, no, please! - Jacek cried in despair. There is a house in Warszewo, on Urlopowa Street, where we all used to meet. I beg you not to kill me.\n\nThe colonel pretended to let out a slight sigh of relief.\n\nAs promised, I will set you free.\n\nIt was mere seconds when Helmuth reached for his gun. Jacek barely realized what was happening. Shot rang through the vast forest. Another innocent life has been lost, joining the many others who have suffered the same fate."

szczecin.5.t: "Sehr geehrter Herr Lindner..."
szczecin.5.desc: "Sitting idly in his office, Christian Lindner felt like a ruin of a man. Slouched, hands on his temples, breath anxiously quickened, and with a nervous tremor in his right leg that simply refused to go away no matter how hard he tried to still himself. By midday, the Eurogoverneur was on his fourth cup of double-brewed black coffee, not that he needed it to stay alert as the persistent feeling of impending doom did more than enough to keep him awake both during the day and especially at night. He could tell his regime was on its last legs, and yet, all he could see around him was apathy. Indifference. Despite the constant protests, despite armed insurgents openly chanting for his deposition, it seemed like nobody even cared enough to intervene on his behalf. The Fatherland failing him yet again was no surprise, though it did sting what little remained of Lindner's patriotic pride. No, it was his supposed 'partners' sitting by that irked him. They stood just as much to lose and still chose to leave him to do all the work? And now, despite repeated prods and pleas, they just... ignored him? Why would they not even have the courtesy to say ANYTHING?\n\nWhatever the reason may have been, the elegantly styled letter lying in front of Lindner was bound to provide at least some answers. Admiring its sleek design, defaced only by a single crease along one of its corners, the exhausted politician handled the note with utmost care despite his visible unsteadiness, feeling almost guilty as he broke its pristine trident seal. After a deep breath, he began to read the contents.\n\nSehr geehrter Herr Lindner,\n\nWe hope this letter finds You well. Though we express our utmost sympathy for You and Your precarious position, we must regretfully inform You that the recent increases in instability have forced us to temporarily suspend our current partnership and unilaterally void any and all arrangements, whether signed or verbal, with the Freistadt's administration. Should the situation permit it, we remain open to restoring our present ties at a more opportune time. Until then, we kindly ask You to refrain from attempting any contact with our organization or any of its individual members. Our representatives will reach out once we are ready to re-enter negotiations.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, listed below are the contracts that will no longer be in effect as of...\n\nUnwilling to read through the numerous blows dealt to his administration by the Hansa's proclamation, Lindner, overcome with anger at their brazen betrayal, chose to resort to the harshest outburst he could muster in his resigned state. Using all his force, he crumpled the letter, setting aside all concerns about its aesthetic qualities, and threw it carelessly towards the nearest trashcan. As the paper bounced off the metal rim and fell on the ground, the official stared at the unbearable disorder it brought to his otherwise orderly workspace, stood up with a sigh, and dropped it neatly where it belonged before sinking back into his chair, defeated."

szczecin.7.desc: "The Simple Dream Piotr Krzystek entered the city hall with unease. As he walked through the main lobby, he resolved to never again rely on a foreign force to accomplish what he should handle himself. The feeling of betrayal lingered deeply in his heart. He realized he had let down his people, but from now on, things would be different - and better. The emptiness of the quickly abandoned building was unsettling, with tons of shredded documents on the floor and every door wide open. Nothing resembled the atmosphere that used to be here. He approached the stairs. A stroll to the upper levels of the city hall evoked many memories in Piotr. Such as he used to greet his hard-working secretary, miss Grażyna. The always cheerful administration. All of this is gone, in the abyss.\n\nAs he approached his former office, his heart began to race. Could this be it? Is he back? His hand shook when he slowly opened the door. After taking a glance throughout the room, he froze. Krzystek looked into the eyes of his biggest enemy, Christian Lindner. He sat at his desk, in his chair, just like Piotr used to do. His heart filled with rage; the only thing he wanted was to tear apart the butcher who had oppressed his people for so long. He slowly approached and sat in front of him. Both men looked into each other’s eyes with indifference.\n\nWhy have you stayed here and not escaped like your colleagues? - Krzystek asked with sincere curiosity. I know my wrongdoings. I know what I have done and what I allowed to happen. Honestly, I never wanted this at all: the violence, occupation, and abasement. That slipped through my hands with continuous orders from Berlin and Tusk. You asked why I stayed; I did it because I wanted to face the consequences. I could not live knowing I did not do the bare minimum to atone for my sins.\n\nThat was not the answer he had anticipated. Piotr imagined this conversation differently. He, the savior, stands against the bloodsucking invader and frees his people. He never realized that the mirror had two sides. Linder was just a broken man, used by the system, much like himself. The devils responsible for everything that happened were safe in Berlin or buried underground. His city, the beautiful Szczecin, has played only a minor role in the complex game of international politics.\n\nAnd what should I do with you, huh? As I mentioned, I accept full responsibility for my actions during the occupation of Szczecin. Please, I was only a mere pawn in all this. I want to go home. I wish I had not left Germany and had returned to Wuppertal. I miss my country, Piotr.\n\nKrzystek thought for a while. Is it just to punish a man who only desires to visit his home? Is it fair to deny the people a sense of justice? Every decision seems to have its drawbacks. After deep calculations, he was confident about what to do."

szczecin.9.desc: " - Report - Piotr Krzystek threw an order at an orderly arriving in his office.\n - The mission turned out to be a success. Here are the details, Mr. President. - The man said placing a file on Krzystek's desk - The Vikings made a critical mistake demanding jewelry instead of banknotes. The coffers with valuables were too heavy to effectively transport them during their retreat on the few remaining ships.\nHe couldn't hide his amusement. Krzystek answered with an encouraging smile.\n - You're dismissed.\n\nHaving been left alone, Krzystek sat in the most comfortable pose he could achieve in his office. Things were better than expected. He never thought they would retrieve loot taken by the Danes. Already, his mind painted the prospects of developing Szczecin with the additional funds concentrated in his hands. Of course, after the president rewards himself for the way his impeccable rule enabled such a superb execution of this military operation that retrieved the people's money back to Szczecin...\n- Oh, right. The people - Krzystek brought himself down to earth.\nHe could hide the fact that those stolen goods belonged to his citizens. And the fact Danegeld functioned more or less like a tax and extensive documentation showed who lost what and now everybody could easily issue a claim to the jewelry or money we retrieved.\n - Perhaps, I could hide the fact we retrieved the valuables. - Not that he was against giving people their rightful possessions. Krzystek just wanted to explore all the angles of the situation. - No, too dangerous.\nThe people would be disappointed that the recent war gave them nothing. And hiding such treasure would involve black market shenanigans and that could be quickly uncovered by the press, either independently or with the help of...\n - The Guild - The companies would surely want a piece of that cake for their 'noble' help in overthrowing the German occupation. Of course, if I gave the money to myself they'd pay up the press agencies to milk the topic to hell and back. On the other hand, if I were to share with them, they'd help me cover my tracks.\n- Decisions, decisions..."

szczecin.10.t: "Koszalin Burns"
szczecin.10.desc: "Their success has been quite surprising. Due to political pressure, the brass issued an order for a single infantry battalion to commence a risky attack against the enemy capital of Koszalin. In spite of the unsupplanted battlefield losses and the fact their lieutenant colonel had fallen ill, the determined unit under its acting commander, Major Robert Rosiak, achieved their objective. As soon as the Szczecinian soldiers saw the Koszalin city sign with 'Basketline' ridiculously sprayed all over it, the Kolonkists raised the white flag. Major remained at a safe distance as his soldiers marched into the town to disarm their adversaries.\n Colonel wanted to burn the city for the raids against civilian property conducted by Polish-Americans. It was merely a suggestion and not a direct order. And the Colonel was not here. Rosiak wanted the occupation to be as smooth and civilized as possible. He wasn't prone to vengeful actions and was of the opinion that early acts of surrender shouldn't be punished by needless violence. If possible he wanted to be remembered as a benign liberator and at the time it seemed doable. So doable that the officer decided to celebrate the incoming victory with a quick smoke. He reached for his favorite Winstons. His wife was always complaining to him about his supposed addiction and asked him to get through at least one day without a single cigarette. Mrs. Rosiak's wish was about to come true though unfortunately not because of the reasons she desired as the major's hand wasn't stopped by his conscience, but by a sharpshooter's shot that hit the officer's arm. Second later, Kolonkist soldiers hidden in the homes opened fire at the Szczecinian battalion. In their last stand, the Americans decided to go down with dishonor. Rosiak fell to the floor of his military jeep. His adjutant immediately approached him after signaling the medics.\n - And to think, I wanted to spare those bastards - Rosiak muttered to himself as his uniform turned redder and redder from his own blood.\n Other soldiers formed a defensive formation around his car providing covering fire as the major was being taken behind the car to be bandaged.\n- Captain - Rosiak wanted to quickly give one last order before being transported to the medical tent - Burn them. Burn all of the government buildings. Don't touch civilian buildings.\nThe defenders forced his hand. Now he had to give this order. He was afraid his own soldiers would torch the city no matter what order he would give. Trying to stem them would only create division among ranks and potential mutiny. The anger of his men couldn't stopped, but Rosiak hoped that thanks to his conditional approval, it could be contained.\n\nAfter the definite pacification of enemy soldiers, the vindictive Szczecinians set ablaze city hall, delegature of voivodeship office and district court. Their white walls soon turned to charcoal black as soldiers cheered at the sight. Still, they listened to their wounded commander's instructions and tried to prevent the fire from consuming the housing district. With mixed results."

In a place where everyone hates him and wishes him death. Alone, among the wolves. The seeming peace seen outside was only a facade. The order that he had imposed was already gone. Although with the constant pressure from Berlin and this traitorous smuck Tusk, he sometimes found moments of peace. Such like this. Outside, life went as usual. Like the hell of the past years, have never actually happened.\n\nIf someone had thought Lindner was fond of the idea of the German intervention, he would have been far from the truth. He never fully supported it. Some speculate that this was the thing that got him here, speaking against those who were higher than him. Deep inside, he knew about his wrongdoings. Poles wanted freedom, which he perfectly understood. His actual desire was to return home, visit the Bundestag, and wander through the streets of Berlin. \n\nBut his dreams and personal views were irrelevant. He had to impose order or end up worse than in the position of Eurogouverneur. This so-called Griffin Guard was a significant ick for him. Another problem was the blood-sucking Hanseatic Guild. Surrounded by enemies everywhere, his power was limited. Krzystek's clique had silent approval and support from the general population, and the resources were too scarce to diminish this threat. Guild, on the other hand, had total control over the state's economy and could shuffle him whenever they wanted. \n\nHis inner peace was no more. Dark thoughts overcame Lindner's mind. Christian extinguished his cigar and slowly walked over to his desk. A load of various reports was already there. He briefly riffled through them with boredom. Military posts attacked there, supply lines disrupted elsewhere - only the worst news, as always. In Stettin, only the most atrocious things can happen to me - Lindner thought. After finishing the reports, before even getting a chance to take a short break to rest, he heard a persistent knock on the door. \n\nIt was his closest ally, Herman Otto Soms. It was a short conversation. Even if Lindner considered a chance to keep peace in Stettin, now he knows his every move is meaningless. At least they have been notified about Germany's intention to abandon Eurokommisariats. After Soms left, he poured himself a glass of whisky, likely left by Krzystek. He must have found joy in governing this city; he never opened it - Lindner murmured to himself. Abandoned by his own country, Christian finally realized how his predecessor felt. There was no hope for him. He had no chance to see his beloved fatherland once again. He knew that judgment day was just around the corner. \n\nHe was ready."
