STE_loza_biznesmenow_desc: "TBD"
STE_piotr_krzystek_desc:"Elected as Mayor of Szczecin all the way back in 2006, Piotr Krzystek has been resisting against PiS policies alongside with his contemporary mayors from other western cities. After falling out of grace with Donald Tusk in 2010, he was a bulwark of nonpartisanship on the edge of a tempestous political storm that took over Poland, especially when Warsaw sent the military to put down riots in 2025.\n\nUpon the announcement of the Eurokorps intervention on request of Tusk, unnotified Krzystek welcomed the mainly German troops in the city. On one hand, his ideology gravitated way closer to Berlin than to Warsaw, on the other, the geographical location of Szczecin so close to the German border put it in a precarious position, so the intervention was welcomed without resistance. However what was meant to be a peaceful operation, soon turned to be an all out war with the loyalist units of the Polish army.\n\nKrzystek was deposed from his position as situation on the front worsened. The new German administration called it "prevention from a possible local insurgency", but in his mind it was surely a petty revenge from Tusk. The ex-mayor went into hiding and formed an underground resistance group, the Griffin Guard, with the aim to depose the occupying German forces.\n\nNow, after months of conflict with local authorities, with support from two out of three Hanza corporations, victory has finally been achieved. As the Eurokorps retreated, the Gryphon flies over Szczecin once more. Now Krzystek, as the leader of a Western Pomeranian powerhouse can consolidate his rule and his loyal populace can finally live free from mistakes of both Warsaw and Berlin."
STE_lindner_desc: "The leader of the Freie Demokratische Partei and former Minister of Finance of the Eurostaat, upon less than fruitful power struggles in Berlin on the eve of the intervention, has been appointed the Gouverneur of the Free City of Stettin. Whether the move was truly a promotion, as the lavish ceremony at the old Pomeranian Dukes' castle would seem to suggest, or simply a punishment for speaking out too loudly against his colleagues' actions during the operation remains unknown, at least officially; however, being pushed aside, thrown out from the halls of the Bundestag to guard an unwilling prize of a conflict he personally opposed has left Christian Lindner feeling strongly embittered towards his compatriots in Berlin.\n\nHaving found himself in the land of his ancestors, the new governor is trying desperately to maintain order and bring prosperity to the Lübeck of Vorpommern, yet constant protests and insurgent activities of the Polish citizenry make the process all but easy. Desperate to ascertain a modicum of autonomy from the controlling grasp of Eurokommissariat Westpolen and too proud to rely on aid from those who spurned him, Lindner has been forced to make pragmatic deals with those he was supposed to govern with a strong hand, stacking his administration with advisors from the region's influential corporations: Polsteam, Netto, and Chemiewerke Pölitz.\n\nWhile Lindner hoped that the considerable economic privileges granted to the local companies would help him maintain order, he soon found himself backed into yet another corner. Seeing the influence they could yield if they combined their operations, the Big Three joined forces, forming the Hanseatic Guild - an organization that quickly established an oligopoly on the city's whole financial sector, effectively tying the noose on which to hang the governor should he ever step out of line.\n\nPlagued with violent insurgents, hordes of protesters, and ruthless capitalists, Lindner's administration stands, at best, on dangerously shaky ground. For now, the Stadtpolizei, with middling support from the local garrison of Eurokorps from Eurokommissariat Westpolen, maintains the fragile peace, or at least the illusion thereof, but it remains to be seen whether this balance shall hold, or if, just like when German formations rolled through Polish soil, Stettin is doomed to be the first domino to fall."

##Ideas##
STE_griffon_partisans: "The Griffon Guerilla"
STE_griffon_partisans_desc: "The city of Stettin is plagued with countless bands of insurgents who sabotage the regime at just about every level of operation. Subversive activity ranges from plastering public spaces with anti-government flyers and indiscriminate vandalism to, at times, an armed militia that often clashes with the local police forces. The Stadtpolizei is spread thin trying to put out the fires of rebellion, but just like a hydra, one flame extinguished causes two more to start elsewhere. Backed against the increasingly enclosing walls, we are struggling to get anything done in the current situation."
STE_anti_partisan: "Anti-Guerilla Operations"
STE_anti_partisan_desc: "The recent influx of fresh officers and newly ingrained zeal in the form of various overly generous bonuses have allowed the Stadtpolizei to resist and push back against local insurgencies. With the tide turning in favor of the government, a large-scale witch hunt spearheaded by the Eurokorps has begun across the entire city and its surroundings to snuff out any remaining forms of organized resistance. Lindner's administration is hopeful that this final crackdown will be enough to quell the rebellious spirit of the populace."

STE_pomeranian_vietnam: "Drawsko Insurgency"
STE_pomeranian_vietnam_desc: "The chaotic times of rebellion and wars are over. The majority of the populace who took up arms in our quest for liberation has dispersed, returning to their homes and families. However not all freedom fighters have put down their arms, and some continue fighting with us as their target. This blemish on our new society has to be removed, else it begins to threaten our people."
STE_griffon_legacy: "Griffin Legacy"
STE_market_forces: "Market Forces"
STE_market_forces_desc: "With its board supporting our endeavours, the Hansa has become a fundamental piece our military might. We wouldn't be anywhere near as capable without their help, and for better or worse, our fates intertwine tighter and tighter. We might've signed a pact with the devil, however as long as the Hanzeatic League sees us as a worthwhile partner, our war machine will remain financed and well oiled, able to put down our enemies. Such help is never without a cost however – and once the dust of war settles, we will surely be reminded of our side of this bargain."
STE_revolutionary_chaos: "Revolutionary Chaos"
STE_revolutionary_chaos_desc: "Since our successful liberation of Szczecin, revolutionary fervour made way to the wish for a return to normality. However, our northern frontiers are under constant pressure from the remaining Eurokorps, requiring a non-stop attention from our army, as well as law enforcement. The revolutionary power vacuum left many districts ridden with gangs and criminal syndicates which terrorise our citizens. Countless citizens don't have access to basic services and essential products. Our newly formed state is being stretched to its limits, we must quickly act to remedy the situation, before the loyalty of our people wavers."

STE_so_ist_leben: "So ist das Leben"
STE_so_ist_leben_desc: "Standing by the window in his office at the city hall, Christian Lindner, the man tasked with governing this bustling trade hub of a coastal metropolis, was deeply immersed in his observations. On the street level, he could see simple, cheerful people about their daily lives, enjoying and cherishing boons provided by the Bundesrepublik. He sighed with glee as he watched a fresh delivery to his favourite cafe, then turned to his assistant.\n\n- Lübeck is so beautiful at this time of year, don't you think Hermann?\n- Sir, it's Stettin.\n- Shut up Hermann.\n"

STE_wild_goose_chase: "Wild Goose Chase"
STE_wild_goose_chase_desc: "We've recieved a report from a Stadtpolizei commandant, which indicates that there are insurgents ammasing in the allotment gardens of Krzekowo. Source of this information is unknown, however Stadtpolizei is ready and able to send a squad to investigate this situation, in case the report is genuine."
STE_fortify_buildings: "Fortify Government Buildings"
STE_fortify_buildings_desc: "The pushback against recent policies and actions has been greater than expected. Angry mobs of disgruntled citizens have started forming around both government and police buildings. To maintain order without escalating the conflict, we should request the Stadtpolizei to establish fortifications, put up planks in windows and set up sandbags. A few rolls of barbed wire wouldn't hurt either."
STE_call_reinforcements: "Call For Reinforcements"
STE_call_reinforcements_desc: "With growing unrest within and around the city, Stadtpolizei headquarters report that their officers are spread too thin. Policemen are simply unable to respond to all calls against anti-government hooligans. The Inspector has voiced concerns and asked for support from the Eurokommisariat command, military action is required to maintain control."
STE_insurgent_whackamole: "Insurgent Whack-a-mole"
STE_insurgent_whackamole_desc: "Tonight was a nightmare for the entire Stettin Stadtpolizei. Seemingly across the entire city, groups of hooligans banded together and performed acts of synchronised vandalism on government related buildings. Police already spread thin, fell completely disorganised. Morning sun shown the full extent of hooliganism, including but not limited to caricature posters of Lindner in the city center, police cars with broken windows and eurokommisariat supply trucks vandalised and robbed clean. However the most prominent "artpiece" is a massive graffiti on the city hall's wall saying "Lindner wypierdalać"."
STE_smoke_them_out: "Smoke Them Out"
STE_smoke_them_out_desc: "It's time to show the hooligans who's riding this thing. Stadtpolizei with Eurokorps support has been rallied and outfitted for full counter-insurgent shakedown. Each suburban house will be checked, all forests will be searched thoroughly, no stone will be left unturned. This certainly will be an unpopular decision, but surely faithful and loyal citizens that have nothing to hide won't mind a justified search."
STE_ausweiss_bitte: "Ausweiss Bitte"
STE_ausweiss_bitte_desc: "Ever since the intervention, Szczecin has been divided into two halves along the Oder river - the right bank under Eurokommisariat Westpolen and left bank under the new administration of Christian Lindner. With the insurgent situation worsening by the day, bridges have been turned into highly restricted military checkpoints. "
STE_scold_companies: "Scold the Companies"
STE_scold_companies_desc: "Governor Lindner was deep in his thoughts sitting at his desk, pen in hand, in front of an empty piece of paper.\n\n- "Dear entrepreneurs"... no no no, this has to be more stern, but... not too stern...\n- Sir, you've been sitting over this paper for over 7 hours now.\n- Oh! Hermann, make yourself useful, tell me how to start this letter.\n- Is it about the corporations again, sir?\n- Yes! They don't take me seriously! ME! Christian Lindner! All those hyenas just want to bleed me dry!\n- To be fair sir, you're at least partially to blame for this situation.\n- Shut up, Hermann... "I hereby declare"... no not like that...\n"

STE_word_from_sponsors_desc: "In todays 7 o'clock news: Christian Lindner's strong worded letter to the Hanzeatic Guild chairmen has leaked, in it he speaks of lack of respect for his position as governor.

STE_hall_of_the_mountain_king: "Claws of the Griffon"
STE_hall_of_the_mountain_king_desc: "Sun rose slowly above Stettin accompanied by birds singing, but also blaring air raid sirens piercing the air. Governor Lindner was awaken from his sleep by a ringing red phone on his night stand. Once he recovered from the initial shock, he immediately picked it up.\n\n- Lindner here.\n- Governor! The insurgents! They're everywhere!\n- Hermann? What's going on, Westpolen troops were keeping the order fine.\n- They... They are gone, Governor, recalled by Tusk!\n- Mein Gott...\n\nHe quickly rushed to the window of his apartment overseeing the city. To his shock, the right bank of the Oder was in chaos, with countless pillars of dark smoke rising to the sky. One thing was sticking out of the darkness... a flag with a red griffon upon it."
STE_hanse_brucke_falling: "Hansa-Brücke is Falling"
STE_hanse_brucke_falling_desc: "As insurgent troops amassed in front of the city hall, last soldiers and policemen that remained loyal quickly barricaded the main entrance. Governor Lindner could be found in a messy suit, running across his office with a big bucket.\n\n- Sir? Why the bucket?\n- Shut up Hermann.\n\nQuickly, he began to throw documents and papers into the bucket, then setting them aflame.\n\n- Come on Hermann, help me, before our convoy comes!\n- Sir... They aren't coming.\n- What? What about our Hansa allies?\n- Netto and Polsteam turned coat, sir.\n- Quick, get me the Chemiewerke CEO then.\n- He's... in Pölitz already, along with the rest of Eurokorps, sir.\n- Scheisse...\n\nGovernor with his assistant stood in the glow of the flaming bucket, as the main doors to the city hall have fallen..."

STE_i_vow_to_thee: "A New Sun Sets"
STE_i_vow_to_thee_desc: "Sun began to set over the city, as sounds of fighting slowly died out. Outside was illuminated only by burning piles of tyres, and torches held by jubilant insurgents. Inside the city hall, Piotr Krzystek made his way to his old office, after delegating his subordinates to capture all Eurokorps troopers and Policemen that surrendered. Greeted with a mess of papers and documents scaterred everywhere by the occupant governor, he sighed with a slight smile painting across his face. He was back home, where he belonged. Upon entering the balcony, crowd cheered his name.\n\n”People of Szczecin! We won! Today is the time to celebrate, for the occupation is no more. Go forth my friends and comrades, as tomorrow, we shall begin work on making this city, our city!”\n\nCrowds gathered upon the main square cheered loudly, waving their torches and improvised weapons. With a strong move, Krzystek broke off the German flag from the balcony and threw it down to the ground. Jubilant mob quickly ripped it and set the fragments aflame. Now, a new era begins for Szczecin, era of freedom."

Garnering more popularity among younger populace, the Summer Union is expected to finish their upcoming convent with a concert of the famous singer: Margaret."
STE_the_castle: "The 'Castle'"
STE_the_castle_desc: "Within the Palace of Pommeranian Princes, the Conservative-Liberal Party "Castle" has emerged.

STE_the_first_session: "The First Session"
STE_the_first_session_desc: "As the first gathering of the newly formed government of Szczecin drew closer and closer, grand preparations took place at the Chrobry Enbankment. Within the walls of Voivodeship Councilhouse, Piotr Krzystek was overseeing a grand refurbishment process, to turn it into a prestigious building of the new parliment of the West Pommeranian metropolis. The largest available room was reserved for the gathering chamber, with seats for both Summer and Castle representatives at left and right side, as well as a biggest seat at the top of the room, for the Leader himself."
STE_szczecin_charter: "The Szczecin Charter"
STE_szczecin_charter_desc: "Long days filled with loud speeches went by, as the first draft of the Szczecinian constitution was finally brought before the gathered representatives. President Krzystek stepped up to the speaker's pedestal, cleared his throat and held up the long, paper draft. His speech now broadcasted to all citizens of Szczecin.\n\n”Dear representatives, we discussed long, made promises and compromises, but now, with this charter of laws and rights, we can finally make this land, truly our own, for all people's of Szczecin.”\nHe set down the paper atop the pedestal, with a pen weighing it down. The leaders of each party took spots at his sides, glancing at each other as the President signed the charter. \n”Mr. Bogucki, Mr. Jaroszewicz, gentlemen, shall we?”\n\nFew seconds have passed in silence, as the two politicians gave each other glances of distrust, unable to decide who should go first. To break the stalemate, President produced a second pen from a pocket in his suit, giving one each. The two gentlemen signed the charter simultaneously, to a wide, standing applause across the room. With this concluded, Szczecin stands with it's own constitution, united as one."

But no longer shall we endure their blasphemous incursions. The time has come to strike back, to drive them from our lands, and to shatter their pagan strongholds.

unification.74.t: "[GetNewspaper]Szczecin unifies West Pomerania!"
unification.74.desc: "In West Pomerania, the stories of the old Hansa never truly died. For some, they proved to be the inspiration for their greatest struggle yet. In an unprecedented display of cooperation, the major corporations of Szczecin banded together, forming a council akin to the former merchant republics. Combining their strengths, they quickly overpowered both the remnants of Tusk’s forces, as well as all other contenders for regional dominance. The confederation now faces its greatest test, as no longer bound by a common enemy, the corporations act independently once more, often in open competition and defiance of existing agreements. For the continued survival of the republic, the currently loose central authority of the council will have to be greatly strengthened, or else conflicting business interests will tear the fledgling state apart before it could even truly get off the ground."

szczecin.1.t: "Promised Land"
szczecin.1.desc: "He slept, as he had no more strength to weep over his sorrow state. Although his dreams were blank, dark canvases for thoughts that couldn't form, he found serenity in them. For the first time in years, he was free. At least for as long as he could dream. Feeling nothing of his poor and dirty body, he has throw aside all known limits of his consciousness. He swam through the dark canvases. He visited the memories of his old home at Kościuszki st. He climbed on the old cornices of tenement houses, and then he jumped. He knew that the empty, concrete street below wouldn’t stop him from flying further into the dream. Into the never-ending space, pulsing with colours to the rhythm of his weak heart. At the end of it he hid in his room of confidence and safety. It was a literal imaginary room he often conjured up in his short sleep breaks. It helped him to hide form the cruel world since his middle school. Every time something bad happened, he went back to his home and hid his head into pillows, as if into proverbial sand. He was really good at daydreaming... but not this time.\n\nAnd then the sound screamed into his ears. It was a terrible, loud and silly jingle from his television he fell asleep in front of. Janusz opened his sore eyes, slowly but intensively feeling the increasing headache he was sentenced to. And sentenced he was rightfully, for his excessive alcohol consumption. His throat scratched without mercy, and the barely visible bottle of Paulaner still clenched in his hand appeared to be completely emptied. Just as the legion of similar ones, standing proudly around the old sofa Janusz was laid on, more like a dead body than an employee of the month. But still, even in his sorry state, he still was exactly that: recently named the best of the SEC's boiler stokers in Stettin. He had God given right to celebrate, as one of the few still valued poles in this once again german city. At least that's how it was in his mind. They might not pay him with the extra money he wants, but the shopping vouchers they threw at him, he eagerly spent to the last. Good thing the shop he used them at was not too picky on what exactly he could buy, or how much alcohol it had. He felt happy, or at least he wanted to. He needed a break though. His old body couldn't take another bottle of ambrosia, so all that was left was to just sit, wait, and watch the loud television in front of him. The sound and light from the Deutsche Welle programme filled his darkened room. And behind the flatscreen TV, there he was:\n\n"...indeed, your worries are over. As your appointed governor, I will continue to take care of the economic growth and integration of the city." - Christian Lindner spoke proudly.
