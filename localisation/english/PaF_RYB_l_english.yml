unification.49.t: "[GetNewspaper]Free Fishermen's Army unifies Wrocławskie!"
unification.49.desc: "The first bit of news in a long while has arrived from Lower Silesia. A group of angler-warriors that took power in the vicinity of the Milicz Ponds managed to organize themselves into a de facto state. Whether because of luck or the incompetence of their rivals, or for some other reason, they strengthened their position in the eastern half of the former voivodeship. Their leader, Andrzej Gałecki, leads his fellow anglers in the spirit of complete freedom to catch fish wherever and whenever they want. Of course, with respect to the traditional fishing spots and spawning seasons. Most of the authorities' offices are located along the Oder and various smaller rivers, as well as near the majority of lakes and ponds. The leader himself sails around the territory on a mighty boat, the state's flagship. The citizens are dismayed, but thanks to the lessons taught by the anglers, they slowly adapt to the new reality."
unification.49.a: "At least they're not trawling?"

super.49.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.49.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.49.a: "United at last."
