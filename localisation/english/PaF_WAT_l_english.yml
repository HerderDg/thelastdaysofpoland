unification.213.t: "[GetNewspaper]WAT unifies the Capital District!"
unification.213.desc: "Military Technical Academy (WAT) has proclaimed itself the sole authority responsible for governance of the Warsaw Capital Region. As for now, the area is speculated to remain under semi-military governance, led by the academic authorities. While not considered in peacetime among the most notable institutions located in the capital, after the Fall WAT was singled out by many as one of the most likely candidates to gain an upper hand in the region. The technical edge provided by the facilities and experts, as well as a formidable proportion of trained manpower, has proven crucial in establishing firm control over the divided city. Should the new regime be able to exploit multiple assets of Warsaw, its resources, location and dense urban network, it could prove a formidable contender in further fighting for reunification."
