unification.213.t: "[GetNewspaper]WAT unifies the Capital District!"
unification.213.desc: "It has been announced recently that the WAT, or Military Technical Academy, has proclaimed itself the sole authority responsible for governance of the Warsaw Capital Region. As for now, the area is  speculated to remain under semi-military governance, led by the academic authorities. \n\nWhile not considered in peacetime among the most notable institutions located in the capital, after the Fall WAT was singled out by many as one of the most likely candidates to gain an upper hand in the region. The technical edge provided by the facilities and experts, as well as a formidable proportion of trained manpower, has proven crucial in establishing firm control over the divided city. \n\nShould the new regime be able to exploit multiple assets of Warsaw, its resources, location and dense urban network, it could prove a formidable contender in further fighting for reunification. Independent observers fear that in its newfound position WAT is primed to exploit its technological prowess to the furthest, possibly escalating the still ongoing conflict through proliferation of modern weaponry."
unification.213.a: "No one lasts forever."
