 POLITICS_STANISLAW_DEREHAJLO_DESC:0 "He’s just doing his job. Father, husband, teacher, local statesman. He believes that every human has their rights and their dignity should be protected – especially during these times. Why would you laugh then? Do you find him funny? Are we really going to laugh at someone’s appearance? Did he hurt you? \n\nEnter the hidden world behind Stanisław Derehajło’s bulky stature and explore the hellscape of absent employee rights, disregard of legal and safety norms, semi-feudal professional relations and overwhelming, mind-numbing paternalism. \n\nAnd please remember, Mr Areczek: the focus tree is for the executive, you’ll make do with the console!"
