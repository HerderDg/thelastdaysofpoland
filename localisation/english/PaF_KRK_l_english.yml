unification.136.t: "[GetNewspaper]Free City of Kraków unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.136.desc: "Even in the chaos of the Polish anarchy, some things simply always stay the same. Such is the case in Kraków, where neither the attacks from numerous warlords nor the disorder within the metropolis itself would prove sufficient in unseating its lifelong president. Jacek Majchrowski's 25 years in charge seem to have no end in sight, as the considerable unrest and uprisings from both sides of the political spectrum proved to only shake him from his previous complacency, allowing for the expansion of his rule beyond the city's borders after a quarter of a century of status quo. In the notoriously conservative Małopolskie, Majchrowski will find no shortage of potential supporters, as the citizens of the region rally behind the politician in search of stability, yearning for peace after years of factional conflict. But with external threats converging on the metropolis, their dream may not be as lasting as they'd wish it to be."

super.136.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.136.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
