unification.149.t: "[GetNewspaper]Women's Protection Brigades unify Kuyavia!"
unification.149.desc: "According to the latest reports, fortunes have truly changed in Kuyavia as the Women’s Protection Brigades, the hopeless exiles of the brutal Toruń Anarchy, defied fate’s will and unified the entire region. Though they were expected to perish after their desperate flight from the city, the disparate flock managed to reform into a professional, determined unit that successfully held back far more established forces. Built upon a foundation of feminist theory and a wide range of social justice concepts, the resurgence of progressive sentiments brought upon by the movement’s victory stands in sharp contrast to the increasingly reactionary population of the voivodeship. Despite attempts to promote equity, the Brigades have thus far been met with far from a warm welcome, with dissatisfied elements close to the new government allegedly pushing for harsher measures to ensure an end to direct and indirect discrimination of the underprivileged. For now, however, the peaceful approach prevails."
unification.149.a: "Strong, independent, and armed to the teeth."

Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.149.a: "United at last."
