unification.149.t: "[GetNewspaper]Women's Protection Brigades unify Kuyavia!"
unification.149.desc: "According to the latest reports, fortunes have truly changed in Kuyavia as the Women's Protection Brigades, the hopeless exiles of the brutal Toruń Anarchy, defied fate's will and unified the entire region. Though they were expected to perish after their desperate flight from the city, the disparate flock managed to reform into a professional, determined unit that successfully held back far more established forces. Built upon a foundation of feminist theory and a wide range of social justice concepts, the resurgence of progressive sentiments brought upon by the movement's victory stands in sharp contrast to the increasingly reactionary population of the voivodeship. Despite attempts to promote equity, the Brigades have thus far been met with far from a warm welcome, with dissatisfied elements close to the new government allegedly pushing for harsher measures to ensure an end to direct and indirect discrimination of the underprivileged. For now, however, the peaceful approach prevails."
unification.149.a: "Strong, independent, and armed to the teeth."

super.149.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.149.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.149.a: "United at last."

 ##IDEAS##
 
AMA_konserwatywki: "Self-Imposed Oppression"
AMA_konserwatywki_desc: "We've always been advocates for greater personal choice. We protested, fought, and died so that women wouldn't have their decisions made by others. Now that the world lies open before them, however, some of them make... questionable choices. They willingly submit themselves to the same oppression endured by past generations, forcing themselves to suffer as willing victims of traditionalist dogmas. We can offer alternatives, educate... but ultimately, we are left to watch as our sisters throw their futures away. As long as the old system stands, many will sacrifice themselves at its altar."

AMA_exiles: "A Nation of Exiles"
AMA_exiles_desc: "Back in '25, from our balconies in Toruń, we popped corks when the government finally collapsed. It was almost cathartic seeing the end of a regime that did everything in its power to take our rights away. For a time, we had every reason to celebrate. Life really got better. Then came the Anarchy. Seeing the writing on the wall, we took all we could and left. The lucky ones found safe havens in one of the few cities that welcomed us. The rest reorganized in the empty swathes of Southern Kuyavia. One day, we will return. For now, we are forced to call the overpopulated temporary encampments our home."

AMA_siostrzenstwo: "The Sisterhood Protects"
AMA_siostrzenstwo_desc: "We were weak. We were alone - just a disorganized, defeated band of refugees trying to survive on hostile soil. We tried to run, but there was nowhere left to run to. The hardship brought us together. It didn't matter who you were before; the Sisterhood welcomes all. The desperate, the outcasts - in our protective embrace, they have found a new purpose. We do not make demands of our members. They work freely for the benefit of the community, realizing their true callings that society so cruelly suppressed. We share the same struggle. It binds us. Together, we will survive."
