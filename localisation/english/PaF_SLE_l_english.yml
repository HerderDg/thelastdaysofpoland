SLE_TESCHIN.1.t: "Purchase of Trans-Olza?"
SLE_TESCHIN.1.desc: "Since after the second world war, territory of Trans-Olza belonged to our country, and now it has fallen into Polish hands. They managed to topple the Eurogovernment that was installed after the Fall of Czechia, and if we don't act - they actually might stay there. It's obvious we can't really force ourselves into another border war with Poles, not at this time at least. But maybe if we offer them money, military equipment, some supplies - we can barter for our rightful lands. Of course...we might not like the answer. But we have to try."
SLE_TESCHIN.1.a: "Back to the status quo?"

SLE_TESCHIN.2.t: "Purchase of Trans-Olza - Czech Proposition"
SLE_TESCHIN.2.desc: "We've managed to get rid of the European Czech forces that were occupying Cieszyn Silesia. And now...Trans-Olza is ours! This was once land full of Polish people, and now we came back again. But now, majority of those lands are Czechs, and it might be a bit of a problem to properly govern these lands. Czech government of Petr Pavel have send us a proposition to purchase Trans-Olza. They would provide us with funds, military help and even civilian supplies. Maybe we should think about it..."
