chiny.1.t: "[GetNewspaper]Death of Xi Jinping "
chiny.1.desc: "The Chairman of the Chinese People's Republic passed away during his sleep after suffering a major stroke. The longtime leader has served China for nearly 30 years. His death marks the end of an era in the nation. After years of stability, the country enters into uneasy times. After acquiring a humiliating defeat during the Second Korean War, China's influence over the region decreased dramatically. In addition, Xi hasn't picked his direct successor, which has resulted in substantial disagreements among the party.\nThe race for power has started, and the rancid state of the economy isn't helping. This tremendous situation puts China's prosperity in question. What is certain is that the People's Republic won't ever be the same. The country declared a long-week national mourning. Who knows what will come after, but the experts have agreed - it will end poorly. "
chiny.1.a: "Another setback for the Red Empire."
