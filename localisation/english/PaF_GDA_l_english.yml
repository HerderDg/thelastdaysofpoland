POLITICS_ALEKSANDRA_DULKIEWICZ_DESC:0 "For some, the decision to betray their country is an obvious one. In this group one can find Aleksandra Dulkiewicz – the mayor of the Free City of Gdańsk. Coming from a bastion of Polish liberalism, and loyal to those beliefs herself, the youthful politician quickly climbed the steps of the political ladder before finally ending up in charge of Poland’s largest coastal city. As much as she wished for her term to be a peaceful one, that wasn’t meant to be, as Mrs. Dulkiewicz found herself increasingly disgusted by the direction her country was heading in. \n\nShe tried to oppose the total political control of PiS. She protested when they tried to centralize power. She even joined the riots when abortion was banned throughout the nation. But no matter what she did, she was powerless to stop the increasingly authoritarian government. And just as Dulkiewicz was about to give up on her attempts, she was handed the greatest chance of her lifetime. \n\nWhen the German invasion came, she didn’t hesitate for even a second before she took the deal with the devil and delivered Mr. Tusk the city of Gdańsk on a silver platter. Finally, she would make things right, help rebuild Poland from the ground up and who cares if it’s under the boot of the Germans? Anything was better than PiS. Surely her countrymen would understand. Surely. \n\nAnd yet, the occupiers failed, with the mayor of Gdańsk now finding herself increasingly isolated in the easternmost territories of the occupation zone. The vultures begin to circle as even the slightest sign of dissent could spiral into a full-blown revolution. \n\nWill Aleksandra Dulkiewicz once again find herself swept up by the tide, this time for good?"

unification.86.desc:0 "Celebrations have erupted all around the coast as Pomerelia finds itself united for the first time since the fall of Poland. Liberals rejoice as despite the efforts of nationalists, reactionaries, and other madmen, the collaborationist forces of the Free City of Gdańsk have expanded their control to include the entirety of the voivodeship. Tipped by experts as having little-to-no chance of making a comeback after their initial collapse due to the overall resentment stemming from their betrayal of Poland during the invasion, Aleksandra Dulkiewicz was nevertheless able to mobilize enough support to not only hold on to Gdańsk, but strike out against all other warlords. Now the real work begins, as rubble from the fighting still covers the region. But with nobody breathing immediately down her neck for the first time in ten years, the ambitious politician should finally be able to implement her long-planned reforms. "
