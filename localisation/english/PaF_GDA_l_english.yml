POLITICS_ALEKSANDRA_DULKIEWICZ_DESC:0 "For some, the decision to betray their country is an obvious one. In this group one can find Aleksandra Dulkiewicz – the mayor of the Free City of Gdańsk. Coming from a bastion of Polish liberalism, and loyal to those beliefs herself, the youthful politician quickly climbed the steps of the political ladder before finally ending up in charge of Poland’s largest coastal city. As much as she wished for her term to be a peaceful one, that wasn’t meant to be, as Mrs. Dulkiewicz found herself increasingly disgusted by the direction her country was heading in. \n\nShe tried to oppose the total political control of PiS. She protested when they tried to centralize power. She even joined the riots when abortion was banned throughout the nation. But no matter what she did, she was powerless to stop the increasingly authoritarian government. And just as Dulkiewicz was about to give up on her attempts, she was handed the greatest chance of her lifetime. \n\nWhen the German invasion came, she didn’t hesitate for even a second before she took the deal with the devil and delivered Mr. Tusk the city of Gdańsk on a silver platter. Finally, she would make things right, help rebuild Poland from the ground up and who cares if it’s under the boot of the Germans? Anything was better than PiS. Surely her countrymen would understand. Surely. \n\nAnd yet, the occupiers failed, with the mayor of Gdańsk now finding herself increasingly isolated in the easternmost territories of the occupation zone. The vultures begin to circle as even the slightest sign of dissent could spiral into a full-blown revolution. \n\nWill Aleksandra Dulkiewicz once again find herself swept up by the tide, this time for good?"

unification.86.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Free City of Gdańsk unifies Pomerelia!"
unification.86.desc: "Celebrations have erupted all around the coast as Pomerelia finds itself united for the first time since the fall of Poland. Liberals rejoice as despite the efforts of nationalists, reactionaries, and other madmen, the collaborationist forces of the Free City of Gdańsk have expanded their control to include the entirety of the voivodeship. Tipped by experts as having little-to-no chance of making a comeback after their initial collapse due to the overall resentment stemming from their betrayal of Poland during the invasion, Aleksandra Dulkiewicz was nevertheless able to mobilize enough support to not only hold on to Gdańsk, but strike out against all other warlords. Now the real work begins, as rubble from the fighting still covers the region. But with nobody breathing immediately down her neck for the first time in ten years, the ambitious politician should finally be able to implement her long-planned reforms. "

Is this merely an isolated incident or the beginning of something larger? Uncertainty shrouds these events. In the background, the influence of President Dulkiewicz's poor decisions can be discerned, which have led to the escalating chaos."

gdansk.collapse.2.desc: "A seven days after the unstable night, in the Old Town of Gdańsk, peculiar events capture the attention of the authorities. A mysterious corsair is gathering people and encouraging them to join his crew by telling incredible stories. This could be the spark of something larger, but cautious observation of the situation is necessary. We don't know where he came from, what his intentions are, and what his impact will be on the city's future development."

Previously ignored by the authorities and with a sense that their needs have been disregarded, they have been prompted into action.

Residents of the northern districts, who were ignored in the past, are now openly expressing dissatisfaction. The streets are filled with protests and demonstrations. Escalating emotions are fueling radicalization, and the opposition is loudly criticizing the authority. Support for the ruling party is dwindling, putting the city's stability in question. The choice lies before President Dulkiewicz: to yield under pressure, attempt negotiations, or maintain her position, risking larger unrest. The fate of the city depends on the decisions of Madam President, which will shape the future of Gdańsk."

gdansk.collapse.5.t: "Osowa declares independence"
gdansk.collapse.5.desc: "Over the past few days, the district of Osowa has declared independence and joined the Kashubians in response to the city's instability caused by the poor decisions of President Dulkiewicz. The residents of Osowa, neglected by the authorities, see secession as an opportunity for a better future. This is a continuation of misguided choices that are plunging Gdańsk into chaos, all due to the neglect of other districts in favor of the south."
gdansk.collapse.5.a: "This is a very painful lesson"
