unification.59.t: "[GetNewspaper]Wałbrzych Government unites Wrocław Voivodeship!"
unification.59.desc: "Though the eventual outcome in the region has been known for quite a while, the confirmation has finally come in from Lower Silesia. The Wałbrzych government has taken full control of the former voivodeship's eastern territories, including the former seat of the Eurokommissariat's authorities - Wrocław. The state - a splinter of the occupying forces' regime - had its goals of quelling dissent dashed by the eruption of the Alcoholic Rebellion. Emerging victorious, it reorganized itself and made further conquests, eliciting careful suspicion from the voivodeship's citizenry. The government in charge of the post-EK territories has been described by some as a pathological paradox, maintaining the pretenses of a normally functioning civilian government while retaining the worst excesses and traditions of Poland's Alcoholic Basin. Whether this amalgam will be able to function in any way akin to a capable state remains questionable, as the ever-tempting call of the bottle threatens to subdue the ailing administration."
unification.59.a: "Running the country while sober is just too much of a hassle."

super.59.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.59.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.59.a: "United at last."
