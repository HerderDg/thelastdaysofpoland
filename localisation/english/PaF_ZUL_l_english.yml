unification.59.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Wałbrzych Government Unites Lower Silesia"
unification.59.desc:0 "Interesting information has come in from Lower Silesia. The Wałbrzych government has taken full control of the former voivodeship’s territories. The state regained its independence from the Eurokommissariat and soon after fought against the Alcoholic Rebellion in its subregion. Emerging victorious, it reorganized itself and made further conquests to the delight of the lower silesian citizens.\n\nPresident Roman Szełemej, who ruled the city of Wałbrzych before the Fall,had become a somewhat controversial visionary keen on huge money-consuming projects and the reorganization of the various areas for the greater good of the region. Despite the eccentric frills that more often than not get in the way of daily life, the people like the new government, which allows them many liberties, guarded by an army of bicycle riding infantry."
