unification.59.t: "[GetNewspaper]Wałbrzych Government unites Lower Silesia"
unification.59.desc: "Interesting information has come in from Lower Silesia. The Wałbrzych government has taken full control of the former voivodeship’s territories. The state - a splinter of EKS's government - was born as a military district tasket with quelling the Alcoholic Rebellion in its subregion. Emerging victorious, it reorganized itself and made further conquests to the delight of the Lower Silesian citizens.\n\nRoman Szełemej - the head of city's European administration and its president from 2011 to 2023 - is a somewhat controversial visionary keen on huge money-consuming projects and reorganization of the various areas for the greater good of the region. Despite the eccentric frills that more often than not get in the way of daily life, the people like the new government, which allows them many liberties, guarded by an army of bicycle-riding infantry."
unification.59.a: "Brrrrriing, Brrriiing!"
