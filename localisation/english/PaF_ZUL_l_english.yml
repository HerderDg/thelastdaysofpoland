The state regained its independence from the Eurokommissariat and after that fought the Alcohol Rebellion in its subregion, after that organised itself and made further conquests to the delight of the lower silesian citizens.\n\nPresident Roman Szełemej, who ruled the city of Wałbrzych before the Collapse, became a leader resistant to hardships as well as a visionary introducing experimental and controversial social campaigns, huge money-consuming constructions and reorganization of the various areas, of course with the support of his ministers, who have many different opinions but are in agreement for the common good. Despite the eccentric frills that make life more difficult, people like the new government, which allows liberties, stablity, economic growth and security ensured by army of bicycle infantry."
