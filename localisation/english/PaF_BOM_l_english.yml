unification.100.t: "[GetNewspaper]Free Army of Bombas unifies Podlachia!"
unification.100.desc: "Major Suchodolski. A name that used to strike only laughter and ridicule in the ears of many, now echoes with respect and fear across the lands of Podlachia. The Free Army of Bombas, under his command, has successfully defeated all rivals in the region. How? No one knows for sure. Some say it's due to sheer luck, others claim it's because of the mysterious 'Nitrotrips' that the Free Army's soldiers are rumored to take before battles, granting them unnatural strength and resilience. Whatever the reason, the Free Army has proven to be an unstoppable force, conquering all opposition and establishing control over Podlachia. The region now looks to Major Suchodolski as its new leader, hoping for stability and prosperity under his rule. Oh, how they are wrong. They don't know yet that Wojciech Suchodolski is simply a drugged lunatic that uses his fame to lead this army. And he has no idea what's happening around him."
