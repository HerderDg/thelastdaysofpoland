POLITICS_MONIKA_JARUZELSKA_DESC: "When the role and weight of a person is determined just by their name, are they destined to save it, or defame it? \n\nWhat could be said about Monika Jaruzelska without mentioning the elephant in the room? A journalist, fashion expert, controversial interviewer – there are quite a few of those in Poland. While not understating her talent, it’s obvious why she was and is in the center of attention. But did she really became the leader of a revolutionary army just because she was the daughter of her father? Revolutions are not the stage of a communist regime when hereditary power is in fashion. Maybe her resolve was strong enough to carry on the weight her father left her in its most farcical manner? \n\nThe legacy Jaruzelska embodies is that of the last stage of communist regime, the one that, bluntly speaking, beat the shit out of opposition, kept the boat afloat for as long as possible and allowed for transformation satisfactory for both sides. There is a promise of overcoming the crisis, ensuring stability and turning back to good old times in that, all the while socialism embodied by General’s dimmed glasses is somewhat more pragmatic then dogmatic. Notwithstanding that, a lot of zealous and radical leftists flock to Żyrardów, hoping they’ve put their bet on the socialist contender that won’t be too soft on anyone opposing. Meanwhile Jaruzelska was known for sympathising once with right-wing loons and outcasts, which could speak freely in her show. \n\nWill she hold the Red Regiment together? Will she act according to the situation bizarre and cruel loop of history put her into? Her father did, and maybe that’s why she’s in charge."

unification.114.desc: "As the People's Militia continues to persecute the inhabitants of Warsaw, Monika Jaruzelska declares herself to be a triumphant in the struggle for the Capital Region. A daughter of controversial communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, she tries to recreate his harsh policy by implementing a martial law until Poland is united. Although she stylises herself as a sincere communist dictator, some left-wing critics claim it's just a way of invoking nostalgia in older generation and in truth 'Lady Comrade's' policies will appease the neoliberals and the far-right."
