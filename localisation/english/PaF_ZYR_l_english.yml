POLITICS_MONIKA_JARUZELSKA_DESC: "When the role and weight of a person is determined just by their name, are they destined to save it, or defame it? \n\nWhat could be said about Monika Jaruzelska without mentioning the elephant in the room? A journalist, fashion expert, controversial interviewer – there are quite a few of those in Poland. While not understating her talent, it’s obvious why she was and is in the center of attention. But did she really became the leader of a revolutionary army just because she was the daughter of her father? Revolutions are not the stage of a communist regime when hereditary power is in fashion. Maybe her resolve was strong enough to carry on the weight her father left her in its most farcical manner? \n\nThe legacy Jaruzelska embodies is that of the last stage of communist regime, the one that, bluntly speaking, beat the shit out of opposition, kept the boat afloat for as long as possible and allowed for transformation satisfactory for both sides. There is a promise of overcoming the crisis, ensuring stability and turning back to good old times in that, all the while socialism embodied by General’s dimmed glasses is somewhat more pragmatic then dogmatic. Notwithstanding that, a lot of zealous and radical leftists flock to Żyrardów, hoping they’ve put their bet on the socialist contender that won’t be too soft on anyone opposing. Meanwhile Jaruzelska was known for sympathising once with right-wing loons and outcasts, which could speak freely in her show. \n\nWill she hold the Red Regiment together? Will she act according to the situation bizarre and cruel loop of history put her into? Her father did, and maybe that’s why she’s in charge."

unification.114.t: "[GetNewspaper]Red Regiment unifies the Capital District!"
unification.114.desc: "Persecution of Warsaw’s inhabitants continues, as The People’s Militia sweep across the capital, snuffing out any remaining embers of resistance. The red wave carries on its shoulders Lady-Comrade Jaruzelska, daughter of the controversial communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski. Soon after taking the reins in the region, she followed in her father’s footsteps instituting martial law, meant to keep order across her dominion until Poland is reunified.\n\nAlthough styled after the final years of the People’s Republic, many left-wing critics claim that the Lady-Comrade’s invocations of “the good old days” under communism are nothing more than a means to invoke nostalgia in the older generation and radical youths. Communist or not, it is clear that Jaruzelska’s state will bring with it the iron fisted rule of an autocrat, one not too different from her right-adjacent counterparts."
unification.114.a: "Like father, like daughter"
