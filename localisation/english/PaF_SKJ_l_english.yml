SKJ_money: "The Bottomless Pocket"
SKJ_money_desc: "A shrewd businessman understands that investments often require a considerable financial jumpstart. The bigger the project, the more resources are needed to prop up its early stages. Despite the costs, for Kulczyk Investments, bankrolling the city-state into following orders is nothing more than pocket change, barely registering in the company's checkbooks. Antiquated technical infrastructure? A modernization effort should do the trick. Diplomatic isolation? Protection can always be bought. Protests? Just throw some money at the most disaffected, and the rest will disperse. Money can solve almost any problem. Some just have a higher pricetag than others."

SKJ_technologia: "Closing the Technological Gap"
SKJ_technologia_desc: "R&D has always been a weak point of the Polish corporate sector. After all, why spend billions on costly projects that bring no guaranteed revenue when you can always copy the designs of our Western partners? Now, with Poland forcefully cast back by two whole ages and a hostile Union unwilling to trade its secrets without demanding the country's submission, we must build our own technological base from scratch. Many industry giants began with a single computer operating from a private garage. Similarly, our nation's research base will start with repurposed warehouses on the outskirts of a local business park. With enough funding, we may yet turn it into something respectable."
