unification.99.t: "[GetNewspaper]Tatar Imamate unifies Podlasie!"
unification.99.desc: "An unfamiliar sound calls to the people of Podlasie. A song, unlike any other in Poland resonating from the newly constructed minarets. It speaks of the Creator's glory, but what separates it from the countless religious chants popular in the country, is that this one is dedicated to Allah. In the greatest time of need, the Tatar community opened its arms and provided aid to the suffering Poles. Together, they built a state based on religious tolerance, where Christianity and Islam coexist. Under the guidance of Tomasz Miśkiewicz a new system of governance was established, combining the previously disparate moralities of the two faiths into one codex. This peaceful synthesis attracted many within the area as the ranks of the Tatars grew, allowing them to survive the following wars of unification. It's clear, though that Poland will not accept Muslim rule peacefully, no matter how tolerant it may be."
unification.99.a: "Allahu Akbar. Ashhadu alla ilaha illallah. Hayya ‘alas-Salah."

super.99.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.99.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.99.a: "United at last."
