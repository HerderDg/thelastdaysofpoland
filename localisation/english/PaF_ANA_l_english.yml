unification.57.desc:0 "Disturbing reports are coming from Wrocław. All of Lower Silesia was united by terrocommandos of the Alcoholy State. The last points of resistance are brutally suppressed. The state enforces its authoritarian alcoholic-caste doctrine by any means, including terrorism and repressions on massive scale.\n\nGeneralissimo Czak Noris - a man with a powerful body andeven greater political power, as well as his council of warriors, who guard the entire state with an iron fist. After the alcoholic split, Czak's fighters were the weakest and smallest group, but they were the fiercest and most radical, which contributed to their victory. Now comes the time for them to take revenge and consolidate their dominion so that no one chooses to oppose them again."
