unification.57.t: "[GetNewspaper]Alcoholy State unifies Wrocław Region"
unification.57.desc: "Disturbing reports are coming from Wrocław. Half of Lower Silesia was united by terro-commandos of the Alcoholy State - a military junta of alcoholics under the leadership of Generalissimo Czak Noris - a man with a powerful body and even greater political power. The last points of resistance are brutally suppressed. The state enforces its authoritarian alcoholic caste doctrine by any means, including terrorism and repressions on a massive scale.\n After the alcoholics from Świdnica and Dzierżoniów split into two groups Czak's fighters came out as a weaker and smaller force, but also as the fiercer one of the two, whose radicalism contributed to their victory. Now comes the time for them to take their revenge and consolidate their dominion so that no one chooses to oppose them again."
