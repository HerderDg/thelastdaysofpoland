unification.57.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Alcoholy State Unites Lower Silesia"
unification.57.desc:0 "Disturbing reports are coming from Wrocław. All of Lower Silesia was united by terrocommandos of Alcoholy State. The last points of resistance are brutally suppressed. The state enforces its authoritarian alcoholic-caste doctrine by any means, including terrorism and repressions on massive scale.\n\nGeneralissimo Czak Noris - a man with powerful body and political power, as well as his council of warriors, with a hard fist, protect the entire territory. After the alcoholic split, the Czak's fighters were the weakest and smallest group, but they were the most fierce and radical, which contributed to their victory. Now is the time for them to take revenge and consolidate their domination so that no one chooses to oppose them again."
unification.57.a:0 "Terrible."
