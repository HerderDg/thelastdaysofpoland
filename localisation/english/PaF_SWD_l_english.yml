unification.10.t: "[GetNewspaper]Świdnik Commune unifies the Lublin Voivodeship!"
unification.10.desc: "After years of struggle, liberation has finally come for the people of Lubelskie as the Commune of Świdnik has unified the voivodeship. The fledgling anarchic state born from a rebellion against the forces of the National Front sent shockwaves throughout the region, as even the halting of their initial advance on the banks of the Bystrzyca did little to shake the resolve of the free men. Mother Anarchy’s children quickly rallied, to the point that now not a single contender remains to try to put the shackles of statism so bravely broken by the people of Świdnik back on. The communes now turn inward, aiming to rebuild the ailing region. Critics remain unconvinced, however, as to whether this construct can survive now that the people are no longer united in conflict. "
