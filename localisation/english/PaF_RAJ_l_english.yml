unification.192.t: "[GetNewspaper]Free Masurian Army Unites Masurian Voivodeship!"
unification.192.desc: "The Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship has been united under the banner of the Masurian Free Navy, ushering in a new era of regional identity—if not maritime law. Celebrations spread from Olsztyn to Giżycko as officials, fishermen, and sailors embraced the newfound naval cause, eager to shape the future of their vast inland waters. With shimmering lakes as its domain and a determined fleet at the ready, the MFN charts a bold course ahead.\n\n Committed to defending local waters, preserving sailing traditions, and enforcing a strict (if self-imposed) order—especially regarding paddle boat etiquette—it proudly raises its flag high.Though lacking a coastline, the Masurian Free Navy sails forward with ambition, unity, and an unshakable belief in its nautical destiny. From misty morning regattas to twilight patrols of the Great Masurian Lakes, it stands as a proud symbol of regional pride, adventure, and unrelenting maritime enthusiasm." 
unification.192.a: "Ciepła krew poleje się strugami!"
