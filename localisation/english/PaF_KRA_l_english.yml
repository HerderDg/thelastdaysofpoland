unification.143.t: "[GetNewspaper]Republic of Kraków unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.143.desc: "Hope returns to Małopolskie, as one of the nation's most fractured regions has now been unified. Furthermore, unlike certain other parts of Poland, a sense of normalcy now persists in Kraków as a relatively moderate force - one loyal to the ideals of liberalism takes the reins of power. Łukasz Gibała has long sought to take the highest office in the city, slowly growing his base of support with each electoral failure, and thus, when Majchrowski finally failed in controlling unrest and a civil war erupted within the former capital, Gibała quickly became one of the favorites to win. His victory means a visible leftward shift in the notoriously conservative region as sweeping reforms aiming to heal the war-torn area have already been rolled out. And it seems more change is already on the way."
unification.143.a: "Status quo lies broken"

super.143.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.143.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.143.a: "United at last."
