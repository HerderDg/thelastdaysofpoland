unification.8.t: "[GetNewspaper]National State of Puławy unifies the Lublin Voivodeship"
unification.8.desc: "New information has reached us from Eastern Poland. The entire Lublin Voivodeship has fallen under control of ONR, National Radical Camp – a far-right movement, which has been by many considered to be a fascist or even neo-Nazi organization.\n\nThe new state seems to be ruled by Marian Kowalski, who has been a well known nationalist in the 2010s, before he fell into political obscurity. Considering his lack of influence and notoriety in the decade prior to the country's collapse, as well as his previously long-severed connections to ONR, some are wondering to what extent he's the real decision maker in the far-right government, instead of only being used a recognizable face to rally local nationalists behind. In any case, ONR is said to be introducing harsh policies in their territory, including oppression of ethnic minorities and apparent militarization of everyday life."
unification.8.a: "Falange flies high over Lublin."
