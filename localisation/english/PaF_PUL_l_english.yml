unification.8.t: "[GetNewspaper]National State of Puławy unifies Lubelskie!"
unification.8.desc: "New information has reached us from the oft-forgotten Eastern Poland. The entire Lublin Voivodeship has fallen under the control of ONR - the National Radical Camp - a far-right movement, which has been considered to be a fascist or even neo-Nazi organization by many. The new state appears to be ruled by Marian Kowalski, who had been a well-known nationalist in the 2010s before falling into political obscurity. Considering his lack of influence and notoriety in the decade prior to the country's collapse, as well as his previously long-severed connections to the ONR, some are wondering if he truly is the real decision-maker in the radically reactionary government instead of serving solely as a recognizable face to rally the local nationalists behind. In any case, regardless of who is truly in charge, what matters is that ONR is said to be introducing harsh policies in their newly conquered territory, including oppression of ethnic minorities and apparent militarization of everyday life."
unification.8.a: "The falange flies high over Lublin."
