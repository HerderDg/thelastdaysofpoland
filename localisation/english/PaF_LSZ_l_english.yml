 LSZ_leszczynski_house: "Leszczyński House"
 LSZ_leszczynski_house_desc: "Leszno and lands around it are governed and ruled by the Leszczyński dynasty. A bloodline originating in XV century has had the pleasure of holding the crown of The Commonwealth upon head of one of its members, even if for a short time and during very troubled times. The house has now began a journey to reclaim its legitimacy and glory the name Leszczyński should carry."
 LSZ_illegitimate_prince: "Illegitimate Prince"
 LSZ_illegitimate_prince_desc: "The current head of the house and ruler of Leszno, is quite unpopular among his subjects. Seen as more of a madman than a true ruler, he's facing a lack of legitimacy of his reign. The future of Leszno is covered in fog, just as his is. The Prince has to maintain his rule decisively, before the duchy slips from his grasp."

unification.157.t: "[GetNewspaper]Leszno unites Southern Greater Poland!"
unification.157.desc: "Following a streak of military victories and shrewd diplomacy by court ambassadors, various new territories across Southern Greater Poland swore fealty to Count Leszczyński. With more and more territories under the rule of house Leszczyński, it became clear that the Principality hailing from Leszno is the new regional hegemon. The royal palace of the Count, normally a location forbidden to an average citizen, opens its gates as a grand ball shall take place, celebrating newly appointed lords joining the ranks of Leszno nobility. As his personal retinue of elite knights takes in new, noble individuals, and as his domain expands and grows more prosperous, Wojciech Edward I's questionable legitimacy seems to be gaining ground and only time will tell if more people gather around the Count, as his authority spreads across new lands."
unification.157.a: "Long Live the Count!"
