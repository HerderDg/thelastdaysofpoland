 LSZ_leszczynski_house: "Leszczyński House"
 LSZ_leszczynski_house_desc: "Leszno and lands around it are governed and ruled by the Leszczyński dynasty. A bloodline originating in XV century has had the pleasure of holding the crown of The Commonwealth upon head of one of its members, even if for a short time and during very troubled times. The house has now began a journey to reclaim its legitimacy and glory the name Leszczyński should carry."
 LSZ_illegitimate_prince: "Illegitimate Prince"
 LSZ_illegitimate_prince_desc: "The current head of the house and ruler of Leszno, is quite unpopular among his subjects. Seen as more of a madman than a true ruler, he's facing a lack of legitimacy of his reign. The future of Leszno is covered in fog, just as his is. The Prince has to maintain his rule decisively, before the duchy slips from his grasp."
