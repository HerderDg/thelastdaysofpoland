unification.198.t: "[GetNewspaper]Slavic National Front unifies West Pomerania!"
unification.198.desc: "The tides of war have shifted once again in West Pomerania. A different flag flies over the Baltic, one that speaks of unity - but on whose terms? Szczecin has fallen under the rule of the Slavic National Front, an ultranationalist regime bound to the old dreams of 'endecja' and a new belief in Slavic brotherhood. At its helm stands Eugeniusz Sendecki, a man who sees himself as the true heir of Roman Dmowski, with Wojciech Olszański serving at his right hand, whipping up fury against all who stand in their way. Poland of his dreams is not one of Western democracy, nor of full Russian submission, but of an alliance built on blood and faith - where Moscow is a partner against the corrupting influence of Berlin, Brussels, and Washington. Observers may wonder if this is merely a prologue to a forced Polish-Russian integration. One thing needs to be admitted - West Pomerania may not yet become just another Russian oblast. For now, it retains a Polish soul..."
unification.198.a: "... burdened with many sins, however."

unificationreg.732.t: "[GetNewspaper]The "Lizards" become the Polish National Union"
unificationreg.732.desc: "It seems like all the traces of the EU intervention in Poland are getting closer to being completely removed, as soldiers of the Polish National Union have recently marched into Gdańsk and taken over the entire territory of the Pomeranian Voivodeship. All remnants of Germanic influence are being aggressively weeded out, with many ethnic Germans being forced into exile, with the campaign being compared to the USSR's actions in Poland following World War 2. Jabłonowski seems to have committed to his alter ego/persona quite a bit more, with some people no longer associating the name of "Wojciech Olszański" with him. As Jabłonowski's government, the "Polish National Council of Comrades", becomes increasingly belligerent, the future of Western Poland seems to be one decided by strength and dedication, and it would without a doubt take significant military effort to stop the Lizards' momentum now."
unificationreg.732.a: "We will rip out our enemies' hearts!"

unificationsupreg.732.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Polish National Union tightens their grip over western Poland"
unificationsupreg.732.desc: "Aleksander Jabłonowski's "Lizards" have expanded beyond Pomerania, successfully conquering Greater Poland and the Łódzkie Voivodeship, and consolidating power as the Polish National Union. Their mission to "rebuild" Poland is nearing completion, but they still need to beat a powerful contender, the current Silesian government which also controls Polish Lusatia. Their enemies' industrial might is now the only thing which stands in their way before they can attack the eastern bank of the Vistula river. As the Polish National Council of Comrades continues ruling with an iron hand, people all across the 4 voivodeships under Jabłonowski's control prepare for the next battle, and under Jabłonowski and Sendecki's ever-ruthless leadership, that battle is sure to be a bloody one"
unificationsupreg.732.a: "We're gonna fucking fight! You human louse, you motherfucker!"

super.732.t: "[GetNewspaper]Polish People's National Republic takes control"
super.732.desc: "Today, Poland has officially been unified and changed in an unexpected fashion. The Polish National Council of Comrades led by Wojciech Olszański AKA Aleksander Jabłonowski and his right-hand man Eugeniusz Sendecki. The ideology of this ruling institution has been described by foreign observers as a form of "National Bolshevism" combining communist collectivism with violent ethno-nationalism. What this means in practice is a burning hatred for anything western, the desire to preserve the Polish catholic identity at all costs, and a policy of putting the Polish people first... As long as the government considers them upstanding citizens, of course. This naturally comes at the expense of minorities' rights and Poland's integration with the west. Most western European countries are shocked by this turn of events, and human rights activists have already accused the Republic's government of committing ethnic cleansing. It is unknown how the situation will evolve, but Poland will surely never be the same again."
super.732.a: "The abyss stares back"
