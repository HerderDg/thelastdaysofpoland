CAL_treaty_of_kornik_idea_desc: "Following a recent border incident, a treaty has been negotiated and signed in the city of Provent, preventing war with our northern neighbours. Diplomatic solution was preferable, however certain factions in the Senate and groups of citizens are disgruntled about the embarassing treaty."

CAL_taxxed_the_barbarians_desc: "Imperium giveth and Imperium taketh. After providing the outsiders with food and housing, a state ordered initiative was implemented to make them work and pay taxes like all other citizens of Calisia. This will certainly boost the economy, but also anger disgruntled and marginalised barbarian minority."

CAL_abducted_women: "Abductions of Women"

CAL_citizenship_for_the_few_desc: "It is foolish for a person to think that every man, woman and child can be named worthy of calisian identity. Our empire was born thanks to the strength of the best the former polish nation could provide. It is then obvious that being a calisian, should be seen as the next stadium of being polish. Chosen by Mars himself, we truly are the Augustus of the nations."

CAL_earn_your_citizenship: "Earn your Citizenship!"
CAL_earn_your_citizenship_desc: "Being a calisian is not only an idea, it is a state of being. An ultimate stage of maturity a human can aspire for. Our great nation was build on a ruins of old Poland, but it is not polish blood that risen the foundations of new cities. It was hard work, will of steel and virtuous loyality to the emperor. Not every man can be named a calisian, but every single one of you can certinaly try to become one!"

The senators’ trial is set to take place within a month’s time, however reports of their actions seem grim. Counts of exploitation against plebis workers, falsifying tax documents, paying insufficient tribute to Emperor Ricardus Calisius and slavery.

With charity, goodwill and no motive but a wish to restore justice and order to our fair city, Ricardus will judge all day and night, until the matter is put to rest.

Let us heed this clarion call to reason amidst fervor worthy of Cicero itself!\n\nThough reform beckons, let us tread with measured steps, guided by the steady hand of deliberation. For in the crucible of governance, it is wisdom, not impulse, that shall shape the course of our noble endeavor.\n\nMay the words of the consul echo through the annals of time, together with enduring spirit of our revered Res Publica and the timeless pursuit of justice tempered by reason."

CAL_rozkradanie_res_publici_desc: "Consul Andreas Compa fails to bring the Senate to function as the Senators continue to squabble among each other, and any attempts to choose a solution to the corruption among the land administration have stopped. Progress on designing plans to redistribute the land and tend to Calisians' woes has been made since the last month, and the Optimates and Populares declare readiness to start implementing their measures. No approach can be decided upon, however, and the Curia Calisia is effectively in complete deadlock."

CAL_stracone_szanse: "Lost Chances"
CAL_stracone_szanse_desc: "News on the situation in the Senate! The Optimates' proposal to form a special quaestorial office for abuses of public land has led to a temporary thaw in the Optimate-Popular conflict in the Curia Calisia, allowing the Senate to partially resume work on the Ager Publicus case. The Senators agreed with the need for an administrative anti-corruption body, and with the punishments provided for by the proposal. \n\nFollowing, the Senate has once again fallen victim to chaos and bickering."

CAL_gniewnosc_demostenesa_desc: "The consul hath spoken with fervor and fervency, delivering a vehement harangue against the Optimates, decreeing that reform of the Ager Publicus is not only essential but must be executed with radical, unyielding precision!\n\nLet his words echo through the hallowed halls of governance, a clear call to arms against the oppressors of the plebeians! For in the crucible of reform, there can be no compromise, no quarter given to those who would defy the will of the people.\n\nConsul's impassioned rhetoric ignites a fervent spirit of rebellion against the established order, propelling the Popular faction towards a future where justice reigns supreme and the Ager Publicus stands as a testament to the triumph of the populace over tyranny!"

CAL_ubozenie_zwyklych_obywateli: "Impoverishing Common Citizens"
CAL_ubozenie_zwyklych_obywateli_desc: "News from the Senate! As Ager Publicus reforms continue, a new resolution has been proposed. All lands falling under Ager Publicus will be confiscated from their respective landowners in order to be evenly redistributed among the patricians. While cases of severe crimes were not found on properties of many honest proprietors, abundant cases of oversized and undersized lots were found. This legislation drafted by the populares will only serve to right the injustices of apparent monopolization attempts by certain landlords. Plebes who do not possess land are encouraged to contact the appropriate authorities with requests for plots of arable land, if experienced or certified in the field."

CAL_glod_ziemi_o_stali: "Hungering for Land and Steel"
CAL_glod_ziemi_o_stali_desc: "More news on Ager Publicus reform! The populares latest stroke on the legislature has been announced. Upon the reform’s passing, effective across every Provincia, Centurial Committees will be granted the additional responsibility of enforcing the rules of Ager Publicus. The Committee members are to be held personally accountable for any breaches of the new laws put in place within their jurisdictions, with punishments of deductions from their paychecks, the loss of their positions or even jail time in extreme cases. Solving any cases of corruption, nepotism or monopolistic practices will be put in the hands of the Committees through any means available to them."

CAL_chaos_na_komisjach_desc: "Chaos hath gripped our fair nation, stemming from tumult within the Senate over the reform of the Ager Publicus. Yet lo, this turmoil hath spread its tendrils, ensnaring even the centuriate assemblies and lower echelons, at times devolving into vigilante justice against landholders.\n\nOnce-steadfast pillars of governance now tremble under the weight of discord and dissent. Factional strife rends the fabric of our society, threatening the very foundation of our beloved Republic.\n\nMARTIAL LAW has been announced in some provincial areas as sanctity of law and order hangs by a thin thread. May the gods forgive our beloved Republic and don’t lose faith in Ricardus Augustus Calisius as he is yet to grace us with his resolve!"

CAL_armia_obywatelska: "Question of Donativum"
CAL_armia_obywatelska_desc: "A question of Donativum, long since filibustered by the Senate, will be heard today by Ricardus’ court!

No one may feel safe as the barbarians kill both the hardworking plebian settlers, but also the illustrious patricians. Both men and women and even the children fall victim to their spears as those horse-riding monsters know no mercy. The might Calisius has sent his faithful legions to the region to punish the rebels.

CAL_lex_indentatae_servitutis_desc: "The question of slavery raised during the Senate's ongoing session! Following the tragic events in Rawicz, a handful of Populares have occupied the rostrum, demanding an immediate end to Calisia's system of forced labor! After a long spat, the factions have agreed to put the matter to a vote, resulting in a more moderate proposal by the reformers to transition to a temporary form of servitude with an option to buy out one's contract after a specified period of work. Concerned about the economic impact, the Optimates demand the labor to instead be performed by subservient populations, enshrining their status as Servi in return for the state providing them housing and appropriate sustenance. Large protests of barbarian groups have erupted in opposition to the proposal."

CAL_lex_militae_desc: "Reinforcements for the army imminent as the Senate finalizes a new bill regarding conscription! In response to requests by Legate Vinicius and other high military commanders, the chamber has swiftly and collectively agreed to expand current conscription laws to ensure a larger force capable of supporting all theaters of war. After a promising start, the issue has bogged down around the matter of which groups should be included in the decree, with the Populares advocating for the founding of barbarian formations as a supplement for the current manpower issues. Claiming them to be untrustworthy and their loyalty to Calisia to be unclear, the Optimates vehemently oppose this idea, claiming that size can be sacrificed and that their smaller, professional army will be far more effective against external threats. While the factions remain polarized on the issue, the final shape of the bill will likely be decided by a handful of undecided senators, unless a passable compromise can be found."

CAL_lex_tributorum_desc: "The solution to the Empire's financial woes drawing nearer! A consensus has been reached among all factions regarding the necessity of a tax reform, and plans have been introduced to the Senate by both parties highlighting the areas where further funds could be obtained for the treasury. True to their name, the Populares insist on an increased tax on the wealthy to not only fix the budgetary deficit but also ease the burden on the impoverished. Outraged at what they refer to as "an attack on those contributing the most to our shared prosperity," the Optimates have instead opted for increased financial obligations on barbarians residing within imperial territory, deemed a more-than-overdue repayment for the benefits they reap. Due to multiple factions and action groups weighing in on the issue, the deadlock is expected to continue for now."

They say the the most vile of criminals should die a painful death for their transgressions, in public might I add. Despite the rumors only a slight minority of Optimates supports crucifixion and this method of execution will not find itself in the official act. As always, they are opposed by the Populares, who are of the opinion that if we can in time civilize the barbarians then we should succeed at civilizing the bandits, especially since some of them are native Calisians."

The Populares promise sweeping change, aiming to extend citizenship to anyone of sufficient status residing on the Empire's territory, should they prove their service to His Grace, Ricardus Calisius. The bipartisanship of this proposal has been rejected by the Optimates, who instead advocate for a one-time financial tribute, equal to the monthly upkeep of a maniple.

At the personal request of the Emperor, as a result of our growing territory and constant increase in non-Calisian subjects, the Senate has agreed to consider the issue of whether barbarian-born individuals can truly be inducted into our superior culture. As per the statement of the Populares, 'to be Calisian is a matter not of birth, but rather a result of embracing our common values.' Senators loyal to the faction wish to secure funding for extensive cultural programs to enlighten the subjugated populations. In response, the Optimates postulate that certain groups are inherently barbaric, and to teach them our ways would merely be a waste of resources. \n\nCitizens are welcome to voice their opinions on the matter.

A vocal progressive sub-faction of the Populares managed to force the inclusion of the matter in the chamber's proceedings, pushing for legislation to recognize and grant protections for long-standing partnerships. The proposal has sparked outrage within the conservative wing of the Optimates, who claim it to be an overt attack on Calisian values and traditions. Their counter-bill vows to evoke the example of our ancient forebearers, allowing males to sleep with others of strictly lower status, as long as the citizen in question takes the dominant role. \nThe final version of the act is expected to be signed into law by the conclusion of the next Mensis."

CAL_lex_religionis: "Lex Religionis"
CAL_lex_religionis_desc: "Matter of religious direction introduced before the Senate! Demands for complete secularization of the Empire by the radicals within the Populares have led to a rare three-way split within the chamber, with the opposition failing to decide on the one true pantheon. While the cult of Jupiter has gained significant popularity within the ranks of the Optimates, many see a return to polytheistic practices as a step too far. A wide coalition has formed, straddling both sides of the aisle, in a bid to preserve the special status of Catholicism and formally recognize it as the primary religion of Calisia.

His plan is for the deceased to be moved to newly built catacombs! Our best miners and architects will ensure that they will resemble those of the bygone times. Praying for the dead underground was the way of the first Christians in Rome, and from those catacombs, our predecessors spread the word of Christ to all the edges of the ancient empire.

With regular patrols along areas previously reported as hotbeds of criminal activity, all roads are henceforth considered safe, and additional precautions no longer need to be taken when moving between municipalities.

This has caused outrage not only within the ranks of their opposition but also among swathes of more moderate senators, who mostly organized their program around the idea of eliminating loopholes within the tax law and punishing known violators to boost public morale.

Small businesses run by Calisian citizens were the primary target of the looting. The plunderers left a trail of havoc and destruction in their path before legionaries could arrive at the scene.

However, some misguided Legions were unaware of Calisius' madness and began to plunder and attack law-abiding Calisian citizens. Most of them are simple soldiers, unaware of the wider complexities and intrigues shaking the Empire. Their minds were unable to recognize Populares' lies as evil demagogy! The consuls only want to punish the scheming traitors, and every sane person can see those legionaries are not the ones to blame. The lives of good Calisians are dear to magnanimous Cinastivicus and Caletus. That is why they send emissaries who shall convince the rogue legates to bow down before the new rule of tradition!

The Populares' cause is doomed and not worthy to die for. They promised land and wheat for the public. Have you seen any of it? They focused on appeasing the Barbarians, surely paid by foreign empires. If you want your well-deserved bounties, come to the Optimates' bosom. Under the wise rule of the Liberatores, you will receive all those things! Soldiers of the so-called 'rogue legions' that swear fealty to the new rule will receive swaths of lands full of fertile soil in Subcarpathia and wealthy villages in Venedia Minor.

As of now, he has not yet responded to the invitation of the Liberatores to discuss the future of Calisia. Ever prudent, he must have been unsure whether the new ruler would be able to save our Empire. All of us can act as witnesses that their combined rule has passed the test of time. The Legate sees it as well, and as of now, he is heading to the capital with his legions, ready to cooperate with the civil powers to reach a consensus for the benefit of all Calisians!

Unfortunately, the Liberatores' hands have been forced by the evil machinations of their enemies. However, we finally have a legal act showing that the execution of the poor, misguided Calisius was indeed justified. Even fanatically loyal Marcus Vinicius has admitted the righteousness of the Liberatores' actions. Now, our great leaders are debating when to hold new elections!

From now on, Calisia will be divided into three equal parts to govern the realm more efficiently! Each Triumvir will govern in a nearly independent manner, dealing with their lands as they see fit. Each will implement the reforms they think are the best.

One jealous Triumvir should not blackmail the others due to coveting their privileged position! That is why Triumvir Caletus demanded Vinicius to relinquish his surpluses of wheat. FOR FREE! That is right! Petrus Caletus represents the Senate; what legitimacy does Vinicius have to refuse his demand? If he is foolish enough to oppose us, we will march to Cracovia and take the food from him by force! We are ready for such a possibility, although we hope it will not come to such extremes, which is why, after lengthy deliberations, our Senators have composed a letter detailing the principles of harmonious cooperation, likening the Triumvirate to an organism, whose parts should work in unison or they all perish away. They wrote that we deserve a fair share of grain for our efforts of defending the border against the vilest kinds of barbarians. The greatest minds of our time have helped the Senators conjure up the most suitable words about the suffering the particularist selfishness could cause.

Because of his murder of our beloved Emperor? Because of his corrupt rule? Because of his fragmentation of Calisia? Yet, for the sake of peace, Legate Vinicius refrains from unwarranted aggression against the usurper despite his crimes. However, the threats of violence may force Vinicius's hand. From now on, not only the export of grain to the senatorial provinces is forbidden. Vinicius declared that all trade with the usurpers and traitors must be stopped.

Despite the agreement detailing the extent of our autonomy, they violated the very core of our national stability. We have a right to execute the Frumenatarii for their excesses and burn Varsovia for this insult. However, Triumvir Caletus is willing to give his former associate one last chance.

Their task is to ensure that the uprisings, especially those waged by Calisians, are not put down with too much excessive cruelty. But to suggest our people are responsible for THEIR troubles? Preposterous! It is clearly a way of blaming us for their own incompetence. How pitiful. As you may expect, our fearless leader is not going to bend under the weight of Caletus's lies.

Today, I am honored to announce that the previous words of condemnation against the great Calisius uttered by Marcus Vinicius during our Empire's darkest days were only a false testimony given under the threat of death.

As such, he will be forced to postpone his just crusade against the evil of Caletus. As of now, we will adopt the strategy of the vulpes instead of that of the leo.

Our people deserve proper bureaucracy, a capital in the form of Varsovia - the old capital of the Veneti. A new senate - free from the corrupt, virtueless senators. Our new senators will chosen from among the greatest; the bravest soldiers and officers who have already served Calisia faithfully, experienced warriors who will not throw away the lives of their fellow soldiers in vain. Do not mistake this focus on statehood for resting on our laurels and forgetting that our true capital remains in Calisia.

Now that tyrant-loving warmonger can no longer threaten us and we can enjoy some semblance of peace. Unfortunately, the semi-independent prefecture of the Praetorians has also benefitted from the pacification of the rebels.

As the faction with the most republican legitimacy and the original Senate within our border, we are well within our right to demand submission from the mere bodyguards. Unfortunately, the law alone cannot guarantee they will listen to us. We will need to build our military, our economy, and visible dignitas.

Thankfully, despite all of his flaws, the leader of the Eastern Provinces is not a barbarian and thus can be reasoned with. The state of our mutual border is less than ideal and will once again cause strain on our administration. There is also the problem of establishing a stable limes in such conditions.

This time, with the Praetorians overseeing the Senate so that a tragedy similar to the one caused by the Populares rule will not emerge.

We will also employ journalists who will monitor any attempts Caletus may undertake to persecute lawful opposition. Maybe they will ensure the peaceful and prosperous unification of our two states.

We will no longer wait like some mere landed cohort while the West basks in the light of imperial glory. No more! We will no longer act as inferiors. This also means greater centralization of our realm. And in turn, that means increased oversight of the local prefects, as there have been numerous complaints and reports about their misbehavior. From now on, the prefects will be chosen by a central body free from the intrigues of local cliques."

calisia.2.t: "Behind the Purple Curtains"
calisia.2.desc: " - What will the Emperor do now? - Conradus, one of the royal servants, unable to cope with the lingering stress, burst out.\n - I heard he plans to reform the system of public land - his colleague tried to ease his companion's worries.\n - Oh Kacper, don't be ridic... - despite the distress, he managed to refrain from saying something that could offend the Emperor. No one knew who could overhear them. - I mean, why would he?\n - Why, he was the one who curtailed the corrupt clergy and took their land. - Caspar backed up his case - He cares for the poor.\n - But redistributing it to the masses - Conradus tried to be much more careful with his words now - That would contradict his previous actions. He used those lands to appease the soldiers and the financial elite.\n\nThe conversation continued for some time, and just as Caspar feared, someone was indeed spying on them and many other servants. Imperator Ricardus Calisius ordered his agents to overhear the rumors surrounding him. To find any traces of a conspiracy and... to satisfy his ego. The Dominus bathed in the attention he was getting from the servants, soldiers, and senators alike. All unsure about his next move. However, the light of the imperial glory cannot outshine the burning flame of corruption that began to slowly consume his domain. Something meaningful had to be done. \nSomething inside him yearned for drastic actions to help the poor masses. A memory etched beyond the edge of his mind. A memory of the red and gold standards of a bygone empire, but not of the old Rome. Something more recent. Something he knew more... intimately. \nCalisius took a sip of his favorite Latium wine to calm his troubled mind. Whatever noble intentions he may have had, he has long since realized that the wealthy senators were the ones financing his state and providing economic progress. Still, the excesses of the corrupt quaestors had to be stopped, even if he needed to take the side of the patricians in the brewing conflict to accomplish it. \nOne thing was certain - he had to break the silence and implement reforms, either revolutionary or evolutionary, to the Ager Publicus system. His postponement of the matter has raised the tension and expectations so high, even the gods on Olympus were aware of them. He'll have to deliver a speech great enough to meet those expectations."

We've cut out half the east wall specifically for this! \n- ...oh Jesus-Christ-Jupiter just... go. Begone. Thanks. \n- O- o-o-of-of-of course. Ave Calisius... \n\nThe emperor was tired of this whole mess already. For the past 3 hours he's been listening to the panic and stutter of ashamed senators who failed to fit in the ceremony's theme, and his bum was really starting to hurt from sitting in the same position for all this time. \nThe fools who already laid their gifts in front of him also weren't helping - they've clumped themselves together in one of the hall's corners and were now bickering between each other about their incompetence and lack of organization. Some of them came to the ceremony with birthday cups and hats, others packed their gifts like Christmas presents, and some were even ostentatiously throwing themselves at the emperor's feet. And they were doing it the wrong way, too - as if he was a pharaoh, not an Augustus. \n\nAll, however, were beaten in their idiocy by certain two stooges: the one who decided to enter the hall in *great style*, whom the emperor've just dismissed after the Scoda Superbus meant as a gift to him failed to fit in the specially prepared hole in the room's wall, nearly robbing the Tłokinia Palace off of its restaurant wing's roof, and Jakub - previously a student, nowadays Calisius' personal aide (or maid, rather), who risked getting trampled to death by a crowd of senators and their guards leaving the hall just to present his ruler with a toaster. A fucking *toaster*. \n\nThe paralympics in sucking up to the emperor lasted for another hour or two, until the last senator promptly stormed out of the building after bestowing the throne with a pair of anti-slip socks and an Angry Birds-themed bedding set. Finally - the palace was emptied of any civil servants, a small wave of servants flooding the building's rooms in their stead. Immedeatly, Calisius himself started manually delegating them to various tasks in a tired, irritated voice. \n- You. Get a brush and tidy the shelves. You, you and you - deal with shit on the tables. You three will handle the floor. You! Call whatever builders still working at this time of the day and tell 'em to patch up the goddamn wall, and *YOU*, Jakub..."

calisia.4.desc: "Andrzej Kompa and Rafał Chwedoruk or Andreas Compa and Raphael Hvedorcus as they were called while addressing the Emperor started a meeting to hear the report of how the bestowments of gifts to Calisius went.\n - Great, oh [urząd], everything went fine completely. Hehe.\n - Get out! - Compa saw through the lies of the emissary. - Had it not been for the avalanche of work I had to do, I'd have gone there myself and done it properly.\nIndeed, as a qualified historian of late antiquity, Compa was the perfect candidate to navigate the meanders of courtly etiquette. Even though he mainly specialized in the Byzantine history.\n - At this point, we'll never convince Calisius to implement our plans - Lamented Hvedorcus.\n - Your plans, you mean? - Compa thought to himself.\nWhile all of the Populares wanted to ease the pain of the poor and democratize the Empire, Hvedorcus was one of the more radical members. He wanted for the workers' syndicates or sodalitates and collegia to be the main form of economic organization.\n - Thank God... or gods, I'm here to temper him - Compa congratulated himself in his mind. Truth be told together they were quite a political powerhouse with Hvedorcus coming up with the reform programs and Compa selling them to the Emperor wrapped in the authentic Roman terminology.\nWhile the duo shined at the court, as the intellectuals and outsiders they met certain difficulties while dealing with the supposed backbone of their movement, the lower classes. Of course, they liked their noble, academic presence, but direct interactions were usually quite awkward. That's why they had the men for the dirty work. When they needed to appease a local mayor they usually sent someone like Silvius Iacobinus, an elder of Ferrerum to visit him with alcohol et ecce, you've got a mayor on your side. However, even Iacobinus can't be everywhere and drink alcohol with all of the imperial subjects (despite what he claims). That's why someone like the leader of the legionaries, Marcus Vinicius would be a great asset to Populares' cause. Would be, as, despite his formal allegiance to the faction, he cares little for it, preferring to focus on his service to the Emperor, while remaining apolitical.\n - OK, the show's over! - ruled Compa - Everyone, get back to work. If the Optimates faces the same problem as we do, our government may yet hold to power."

calisia.5.t: "Arsetocracy"
calisia.5.desc: "- They really brought him a toaster? - Petrus Caletus couldn't stop laughing after hearing the news. The rest of the Optimates in the room joined him, though with much less enthusiasm\n- Oh, if that's how they handle things without supervision, maybe I shouldn't try to push them to do any better. That shit's just too funny - Caletus thought to himself - Alright, next time read some protocols and learn some Latin or you'll screw the... *admissio* again. The official part of the meeting is over. Let us enjoy wine in my atrium. You may go, I will join you in a short time.\nAs the fellow supporters of Optimates' cause were leaving the room, Caletus was pondering about the future of their faction.\nDespite the joy of witnessing numerous fuck-ups, Kaleta... Caletus knew he needed to get his stuff together if his faction was going to succeed. He already underestimated those Populares nerds and Calisius chose them as their current advisors. He did that despite the familiarity he and Thaddaeus Scarginscis had regarding the ins and outs of local politics. Despite the quiet approval of the Cinastovicus and his pretorians. Even despite the fact Optimates are more beloved by the very populus the Populares claim to represent.\n- Still, I shouldn't be surprised - Caletus thought to himself - despite their flaws the eggheaded outsiders were more pragmatic when it turned out Calisius was serious in his attempts to resurrect Rome in Poland. They quickly adopted the appropriate jargon, dressed in togas, and used Latin interjections as often as they could. The traditionalist leader of Optimates at the beginning was unwilling to comply with the new rules. And he paid the price. After Calisius humiliated him by siding with the Populares, MP Kaleta realized, he would need to become senator Caletus if he wanted to rule Calisia. Now that the transformation is complete, the well-oiled machine of Optimates with Caletus crowd-winning plainspokenness, helped by the authority of mighty Gaius Ceplus and secrets uncovered for them by tovicus will be unstoppable.\n - Ugh, enough thinking for one day.

calisia.8.desc: "Year: [GetYear]\nLocation: Abbasinum\n\nAve Imperator Ricardus Calisius.\nAs you highness dictated, I have conducted a thorough inspection into the matters of Ager Publicus in Abbasinum. Due to the proximity to Urbs, local patrician, Vilius Avarus, was determined to hide his crimes. While pretending to possess just an average-sized farm, he in truth has built his own latifundium. Using strongarm tactics, he either forced the coloni to pay rent to him or confiscated land for himself. The latter was achieved by his alliance with local iudex. His associate framed several coloni and sentenced them to a life of slavery. Avarus became the owner of the land, bought said slaves, landed them, and ordered them to present themselves as independent coloni in case a regular questor control appeared. That is why I had to act in secret. I have disguised myself as a worker looking for work. I was observed regularly and my freedom of movement was restricted. I became a slave, kept in truly Spartan conditions until I was able to escape to relate the state of Abbasinium to Your Highness. By my observation, the way he treated me is his modus operandi regarding all workers in his estate. As Your Majesty can guess the state of the Calisian countryside is catastrophic. Wealthy landowners control the land and reap the fruits of our fertile soil. The poor suffer under their iron fist. The dissonance between Your Majesty's vision and the practical implementation of Ager Publicus is striking. I suggest immediate and drastic action."

And he worked for less than minimal wage. \n– Enough with the talk. Show me your projects! – Calisius commanded. \nA few bills were set before him. On averse, there was the usual profile of emperor, on the reverse – the depictions of Legion’s crossing the Prosna on a makeshift bridge, capturing a tank or fighting barbarians. \n– Is that a German? Beaten on the helmet? Timeless classic. I’m sure the men will appreciate these. \n– Oh Emperor! You honor me, but please, reconsider whom you will reward. Those legionaries are dirty scoundrels, and their Vinicius is a good-for-nothing. Don’t let those bills fall into their dirty hands; they’ll squander them in one day. The pretorians, on the other hand, would-  \n– I know full well I’ll see this money once in my life and never again. The true problem is the feast for whoever gets the donativum. \n– You mean, oh divine? \n– The legionaries would prolly appreciate a whole load of huge, cheap Polish-style pizza. Greasy, thick, with a shitload of cheese. Plus a ton of cheap wine. Jabol, even. I’m not sure if this is what we want to strive for. Bread, circus and orgy all day long – Kalisz sighed. – Meanwhile, the pretorians would expect an actual Napoletana, and while I do enjoy a good Napoletana, it’s a bit on the nose. These men are thugs, first and foremost, and they won’t distinguish a good Umbrian wine from Żabka’s Fresco. They just want wealth, and with it, power. \n\nThe emperor grabbed a bill to wipe out sweat from his forehead. No matter whom he would choose..."

The barracks barely resembled their usual self, upscaled into a lavish, albeit impromptu dining hall. Still, all the forced decorum and self-aggrandizement of the late soirée could barely conceal the true brutishness of Calisia's upstart elite guard. With each swig of the finest local red, the carefully crafted mannerisms that allowed the praetorians to brush shoulders with the Emperor himself clashed with their plebeian nature, slowly devolving the meeting into a feast only Bacchus would look favorably upon. \n\nFrom among the dozen voices of high-ranking officers trying to shout over one another in their drunken stream of consciousness, the center of attention slowly shifted toward the central figure of the pack, still clad in his full suit of armor. Christianus Cinastovicus might not seem like the most imposing figure, yet the regal purple adorning his figure exuded a whole different aura - prestige, and authority. When he raised his cup into the air, the chatter immediately quieted down. \n\n- Enjoy yourselves tonight, men, for our drinks are paid from the Emperor's coffers! Ave Calisius! - an agreeing cheer followed the words. The praetorians needed no encouragement to empty another round, but knowing it was their sovereign's Denarius sponsoring the feast made the wine taste even sweeter. \n- His Highness finally decided to reward our exemplary service with a nice little bonus. Guess protection has a steep price when you're the most hated man in Calisia. - he snarkily continued. \n- Oh please. The old sod's gonna have his heart give out long before anyone could actually strike at him. - a jolly guard interrupted, forgetting himself amid the drunken conversation. \n- That 'old sod' is your only path to a paycheck, Gaius. And your only chance at actual relevancy. You better pray he lives long enough for you to earn yourself a comfortable pension. \n- And what if our beloved Emperor ever grows stingy with his protection money, Christianus? \nThe praetorian leader smiled in mutual understanding. \n- Oh, it's quite simple..."

The men picked fight about everything. Games, bitches, politics, past and future – you name it. They were worse than their fathers and brothers; the young men who came before. More drunk, more belligerent. Actually convinced about their impunity. That is, until they’ve started being whipped in the barracks. \n\nNonetheless, the old man looked on them with little fear or resentment. It’s true, some of them did not consider a ‘kebab’ something worth spending their salarium on. There was no arguing with them; just a quick nod to the cohortes urbanae, when they arrived to pick this night’s offenders. However, majority of guests were drunk and magnanimous enough to leave more pennies than necessary, just to show off. It would seem respect for the man behind the counter weighted more than esteem among one’s comrades. \n\nAs drunk legionaries were knocked down by either clubs or alcohol, old Turk thought to himself that this masquerade was somewhat... enjoyable. Everyone had to play his part, and his was fairly easy: no one knew how a ‘Roman kebab’ was supposed to be like, so he could improvise. But the clients, especially the legionaries, acted different. True, they were a bunch of aggresive, drunk and probably racist young men with need to knock someone up or down – just like before. But this time, they had a purpose. They wanted to fight for the city. To protect it. Maybe just because they were paid better now and then.\n\nOr maybe because they actually begun to care. \n\nThe owner shrugged, soaked the mop and started wiping vomit, blood and sauce from the floor.

calisia.13.desc: "Another gathering of the Senate, another few hours of listening to other Senators speak with audibly forced eloquence about the need to make a dog park somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Normally Consul Andreas Compa would be bored out of his mind, dozing off, exchanging glares with some optimates, or simply chatting with other senators to either of his sides, however today he had no time for meaningless chatter. In fact, he didn’t have much time for anything, as he sat there stressfully clenching a small file of papers in his hands. Compa was given the dubious honor of delivering a speech that could either kickstart, or kill the idea of reforming the Ager Publicus on arrival. Time flew by him, and soon enough it was finally his time to speak before his colleagues. He stood up and with the weight of the world crashing down upon his shoulders, stepped up to the podium. \n\n- The issue that I will be talking about today is one of grave importance. I speak today not as a populares, but instead as a senator concerned with the current ongoing crisis. As I assume you all know, recent findings have uncovered many inefficiencies and flaws in the system of Ager Publicus. Plebes working the lands of certain patricians and even some senators have been found to be exploited, overworked and unfairly rewarded for their labor. On top of that, cases of tax reports meant to fund the Res Publica being falsified have also been uncovered.\n\nMurmurs spread through the Senate hall, each quiet on their own, but gathering into a deafening clamor. The loudest and seemingly most concerned of the whispers spread from the seats occupied by the optimates. Before the noise could grow any louder, Compa cleared his throat, returning the hall’s attention back to himself. As he continued to speak, he locked eyes with one man in particular: Petrus Caletus, the unofficial leader of the optimates.\n\n- A glaring problem within this whole ordeal is the inexcusable behavior of the optimates. Ever since the news of overreaches within the Ager Publicus have been brought to light, they haven’t done as much as lifted a finger in the way of fixing this problem. These actions speak louder than words and every Calisian will be well aware of their inaction. It’s really not surprising seeing them in this position; most cases of corruption and exploitation to varying degrees have been noted in properties owned directly, or indirectly by members of the optimates.\n\nCompa couldn’t help but feel accomplished, seeing the face of Consul Caletus drop from a veneer of confidence to a grimace of poorly bottled up rage. Murmurs once again drowned out any other noise within the hall, this time interspersed with chuckles from the side of the populares. This time, the murmurs dispersed on their own after a short while, letting the Consul continue unimpeded.\n\n- However, members of the populares are not guilt-free. Despite what some in this hall may think, this is not a reason to squabble amongst each other. Ager Publicus is flawed and we, as humble servants of the Res Publica must work to fix it. The fact of the matter is however, that reform..."

calisia.14.desc: "Paulus was a wealthy man, his manor - a display of opulence so typical of the nouveau riche. Many speculated just how the former farmer managed to hoard enough wealth to become one of Calisia's largest landowners despite never having a meaningful source of income. He always seemed to have enough gold to keep them all quiet, though. With powerful friends in places both high and low, nothing happened in Calisia without Paulus' explicit acknowledgment. Until an angry mob showed up in front of his estate, that is. \n\nBy now, Paulus had been used to his serfs occasionally getting uppity. Every time some overly ambitious Popular introduced a clearly doomed reform, the rabble stirred, desperately seeking a chance to break free from their master. Nothing a few lashes couldn't fix. Still, the landowner had grown rather accustomed to getting an early warning from his proteges within the Optimates. Ever since he first started sponsoring the faction, not once have they forgotten to consider their benefactor. This was different. Something was definitely wrong. \n\nThough a tinge of fear gripped his chest, Paulus raised his chin proudly and approached his servants with a nobleman's typical poise. Almost upon sight, a particularly notable troublemaker, Andrzej, spat at his master's feet. \n\n- Your time's coming to an end, tyrant! We're done serving you! Soon you'll be the one breaking your back with the plow to make ends meet while we reap the rewards for our years of hard labor. \n- This again, Andrzej? We've been through it before. I don't know what crazy propaganda piece you've seen this time, but you seem to forget the strength of our wonderful status quo. Like always. Now, get back in the field, and I won't even double your quota. \n- Oh, sure you will! You have no power over us anymore. Once the reform of this ‘Ager Publicus’ you cling to finally passes the Senate, you’ll be left with nothing. If you have your brains still with you, I suggest you run, otherwise, we’ll take everything you owe by force. Though... actually, please do stay, we’ll get to enjoy it far more that way. \n\nPaulus could feel his heart race. He anticipated the situation in the capital to be dire, but the boldness of the peasants’ claims was enough to make him terrified for his life. In every other situation, they made sure to tone down their rhetoric, leaving themselves a peaceful way back into his graces in case things fell through. And he’d always been merciful, at least that’s what he always told himself. His neighbors were far worse, after all. He’d never burned, blinded, or castrated anyone, so if even he was the subject of such vitriol, things had to be critical. Foregoing his authoritative mannerisms, Paulus hurriedly ran back to his manor and readied his carriage. Once again, he was going straight to Calisia to fix the others’ mess."

calisia.15.desc: "In the shadow of looming clouds, the conquerors' march heralded the fall of Gniezno, once a proud bastion of Przemysł III's realm. The streets, once teeming with life, now whispered with lamentation as the Calisian legions imposed their dominion. The ancient stones, imbued with the echoes of Poland's storied past, beheld a scene of desolation - a kingdom's lament etched upon its very foundations. There was no cheer, no triumphant entry, no festivities to \n\nGniezno's citadel, now subdued, bore witness to the inexorable passage of fate. Przemysł III, once sovereign, now captive, trudged amidst his captors, his regal bearing eclipsed by the weight of defeat. The conquerors, merciless in their triumph, paraded the former king, the vanquished leader, the unbound defender of his vassals through the desolate thoroughfares, akin to Vercingetorix's ignominious procession in ancient Gaul. No jubilant cheers resounded through the streets, no banners waved in celebration. Instead, a pall of sorrow hung heavy in the air, mourning the loss of sovereignty and the end of an era. Legions paid no heed to the silent grief that enveloped the city, as their eyes were fixed on the horizon, where the sun of Calisian hegemony rose triumphant, consolidating their first important conquest.\n\nAnd so, amidst the ruins of a once-great city, Przemysł III, defeated but unbowed, marched on, he seemed to be a symbol of resistance in the face of adversity, his spirit unbroken despite the chains that bound him. But he was about to rot in the dungeons for the years ahead. Defiance of armies of the Principality of Gniezno sealed their fate, and there was no warm home that would welcome them back from their war campaign, there was only cold iron of shackles and prospect of spending the rest of their lives in a dark cell. Such was the future that Calisia has brought. A trip to the past as a prisoner of a rising empire."

calisia.16.desc: "In Leszno, once the historical seat of the Leszczyński family, the remains of a fire smoldered. Wojciech Edward Leszczyński ensured that nothing would fall into the hands of the advancing Calisian army. All the most important documents were destroyed, the main administrative centers burned down, and the city itself had the appearance of an initially deserted battlefield. Leszno's cobbled streets, which had echoed with the tumult of conflict, now reverberated with the disciplined steps of the Calisian troops. The citizens, emerging from the shadows of their homes, watched with wary eyes as the conquerors passed. Their faces bore the marks of recent hardships, but in their gazes flickered a tentative hope, kindled by the promise of stability and new beginnings that Calisian legions were bringing.\n\nIn the midst of this conquest, a grand triumph was to be held that would herald the dawn of Calisian rule over Leszno. The procession was led by Ricardus Calisius, the emperor himself, whose presence commanded both awe and reverence. He surveyed the assembled crowd with a serene yet authoritative gaze. Behind him followed the ranks of his legionnaires, their armor gleaming, their banners held high. The sight, though imposing, carried a promise of order and renewal. There was one missing spot in this whole parade - the leader of a conquered nation wasn’t there to see for himself the downfall of his whole kingdom.\n\nAs the procession advanced, the citizens of Leszno began to gather in greater numbers. Their initial hesitance gave way to cautious applause, a gesture of reluctant acceptance mingled with the hope for a better future. The Calisian soldiers, disciplined and resolute, acknowledged the people with nods of respect, signaling a departure from the cruelty of previous overlords. People of Leszno were yet to experience the true reality of life in a Calisian Empire, but for now it was just a province to be integrated so it was treated with utmost care. The emperor began his speech, painting a vision of a future where Leszno would flourish under the benevolent rule of Calisia, where the scars of war would heal, and where every citizen would have a stake in the city's resurgence. It was enough for them to believe. But loyalty will have to be earned."

At Kórnik's keep, the defeated Terra Felix leader, Jacek Kowalski, was compelled to ink an act of absolute surrender. Ancient Rome, renowned not for clemency, but for its harsh treatment of war-bound captives, left Kowalski anticipating the direst of fates. Yet, as often occurs, a destiny more grievous than death loomed - public humiliation. And so it arrived, heralded by the entrance of the Calisian Emperor, Ricardus Calisius, to celebrate his triumph in Środa Wielkopolska, officially renamed Mercuria Maior.\n\nThe townsfolk, estranged from the hegemonic rule of Kowalski emanating from his ancestral Kórnik, poured into the streets to hail their liberators, no matter how unfamiliar. Having endured a regression to the opulent aristocratic past of the golden era of polish nobility, they now traversed even further back in time. The market square of Mercuria was decorated in a manner never before seen in the town's history. The multitude of banners, standards, and imperial symbols created an impression of immense splendor, and the nearby stadium was filled with fireworks to enhance the entire event.\n\nThe Emperor's entry elicited resounding cheers from the legionnaires, met with warm smiles and regal salutations from Ricardus as he passed in his gilded chariot. Behind him trailed the Praetorians, driving a chariot carrying an iron cage, wherein lay the vanquished and humbled Kowalski. It was a sad sight, and the professor-hetman was further demoralized by the fact that the people were so joyous at his downfall. As they cheered with a thunderous applause, they had not known they traded their golden freedom for the emperor's whip.\n\nIn the very market square during Emperor Ricardus's speech, the crowd began to warm to their new governor. The discourse concluded not with discord, but with harmony - a symphony that transcended the exuberance of the Jarocin Festival. Guarded by sentinels, Kowalski ascended the stage to intone, in Latin's lyrical embrace, the verses of a song:\n\n- Per Poloniam gradiens durus passus legionum tonat..."

Others sported makeshift helmets and silvery fishscale overalls, which – apparently – were supposed to resemble lamellar armour. \n– You bunch of barbarian maggots ever heard of thermae or razors? – the prefect asked. \n– With all due respect, good sire – the horsemen leader rode forward – we were not keen on losing our identity, and our considerable facial hair, under new government. But, well, as we were recognised as equites of the empire, we, uh, found ourselves in need to adapt. We are still Sarmatians, only the ancient kind. The real one, if you prefer, good sire. \n\nThe silence was as uncomfortable as lamellar overalls. After a longer while, a young optio broke out. \n– Quintus... Quintus, don’t irritate yourself... \n– How I’m supposed not to irritate? \n– Easy, they’ll latinize... \n– They won’t latinize! Nothing will latinize! I won’t get another equites like that! We were supposed to recruit a good bunch of horsemen and not some steppe throatsinger wannabies! I bet they can’t even do Parthian shot! \n\nAs on command, a few arrows flew towards the Roman delegation.

The gates of palace was shut, and in each window, a rifleman waited for the command to open fire. \n\nRumour had it a whole legion was sent to capture the estates. How fitting that the Lechite monarchy was to be ended by its eternal Roman enemies! Or maybe not, the count thought. The cause of the Lechites would be taken up by another warlord elsewhere in Poland. There’s no need to be dramatic about it. \n\nAs Leszczyński walked through the halls of his palace, he noticed the portrait of his great ancestor, king of Poland, great duke of Lithuania, prince of Lotharingia Stanisław Leszczyński.

It's the third time this month. It has to be some mistake. Send him back, and make sure not to give him a penny. \n\nPaweł has seen his fair share of invasions in the years following the Fall. The Germans had just been the start. Since then, rarely has a month passed without some raiding party trying to burn and plunder his lands. So, too, has he grown accustomed to the almost bi-annual occupations. Limanówka has changed hands more times than he could count, and over the multitude of attacks and tyrannical overlords, it has learned how to defend itself. A private garrison, traps surrounding the estate's entire perimeter... far too much trouble for the meager amount of loot stored inside. \n\nThey felt safe. The magnanimous Praetorians must have had some administrative trouble and accidentally sent their official to the wrong place. Paweł expected the emissary to return with an apology. Instead, he had brought an army to their doorstep, set to make an example of anyone who dared defy the Praefectus. \n\nLimanówka put up one hell of a fight. Before the first units reached the perimeter, half of the vanguard had already been dead, while the rest were forced to retreat in shame. But for every fallen legionary, two more joined the fray like a vengeful, thousand-head hydra. With every passing minute, the invaders got closer, disregarding any losses through nearly fanatical iron discipline. Eventually, bullets started to run out for the defenders. Rationing became a necessity. The attackers stepped over the bodies of their slain comrades to continue their relentless push forward until Paweł saw no choice but to wave the white flag. \n\nThe leader of the estate's defenses had been granted mercy. At least that's what the Praetorians called it. Paweł would live to see another day, 	forced to watch as his entire livelihood burned before him. Whenever the defeated landowner averted his eyes from the bonfire engulfing his home, a crack of the captors' whip set him straight. Left out in the countryside without a single Denarius to his name, he has wandered the land ever since; a restless traveler whiling his final days away. Each month, he returns to Limanówka to pay his respects to his fallen companions and servants.

If he was to die, he might as well get his last act of revenge. A precise strike slashed Szymon's arm. He felt no pain, even as the weapon pierced his flesh deeply. This was his opportunity. He lunged at his adversary, pushing past his defenses and stabbing him repeatedly until only a lifeless husk of the former gladiator remained on the ground. \n\nEventually, exhausted, the victor stood to face the frenzied crowd. He had fuelled their bloodlust, and though all that mattered to him was vengeance, he awaited his freedom nonetheless. \n\n- The Emperor has decreed death! - the announcer's jubilant voice exclaimed. \n\n Amidst the buzz and rushing adrenaline, Szymon never even got to hear his sentence.

Sebastianus embraced this vision wholeheartedly, his literary efforts supporting Calisia in its direst time of need. For his loyalty, he was to be rewarded. \n\nEver since receiving his senatorial mandate, Sebastianus could barely get a full night's rest in excitement. The prospect of squaring up against Cicero's spiritual descendants in the finest examples of rhetorical theater motivated him like nothing else. He spent nearly all his free time musing about imagined discussions and writing speeches that were to grip both hearts and minds. On the long-awaited day of his official introduction to the chamber, with a glint in his eye and a spring in his step, the young deputy made his way to the richly adorned marble structure that was to be his second home for the remainder of the term. \n\nThough he had seen the building almost daily, Sebastianus could hardly decide whether it was more breathtaking from the outside or the inside. For him, the senate was an island of civilization in the endless sea of barbarism. Each clack of the floortiles evoked a new dream of reclaiming the sense of civility lost over the centuries. He reached the ornate doors of the chamber. He was ready. Or so he thought. \n\n- JUNO'S CUNT, ANDREAS - YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

BEST WE COULD DO IS NAIL YOUR CORRUPT HANDS TO THE SENATE DOORS. \n\nThese words caused the crowd of senators to go completely livid. Or maybe it was the shoe thrown by one of the Optimates. Either way, it's good that the lictors had gone away because otherwise, Petrus Caletus would surely have used one of their fasces to beat the raging populares out of the building. \n\nAnd in the corner of it all, Sebastianus stood, speechless, mouth agape. Civilization had truly fallen, and Calisia was the center of its demise. Ignoring the commotion, he staggered towards his seat, resigned. These are bound to be some awfully long years."

None of the men inside woke up. None of those lying in the hall, or in the offices, or on the stairs, on those in the bathroom. None of the men filling the whole fucking building. \n – There is enough men here to form a centuria. We’re gonna need more trucks. \n – There’s a note here. „IM IN GARDEN BEHIND", it says. \nStepping over incapacitated men, decurions made their way towards back doors, and freezed for a while. \n\nThe whole garden was filled with tents. Regular, proper camp, although with no walls, ditches or alert guards, and certainly without latrines. Inside each tent, fresh legionaries were carefully tucked in, still sleeping soundly. The only noise, aside from snoring, came from a tent in the back, in the place where commander would normally reside. \n\nInside, amidst heaps of recruitment contracts, Silvius Jacobinus reclined in his chair, half-empty bottle in his one hand, other clicking seemingly random keys on the laptop. \n – You’re finally here – he mumbled. – I’m getting fucking bored since I’ve been in the middle of Quo vadis when one of these buggers pulled his fucking pants off, shat on my laptop and now it doesn't work."

calisia.26.desc: "As shades of orange, pink, and blue clashed on the evening sky, and the first stars prepared to brighten up the coming night, the Emperor lounged on the balcony of his Imperial Palace, looking over the city with a glass of wine in hand. It was his place of solace, away from the constant squabbles of the senate, plights of the people, and especially the unending tug-of-war between the Empire's factions. He often found himself frequenting this spot whenever the burden of ruling Calisia overwhelmed him. Usually, turning to his worst habits was merely an escape for Ricardus, but this time, he had a good reason to feel accomplished. His improbable statelet had burgeoned into a regional powerhouse, stretching all the way from the Kuyavian Lakelands to the Silesian highlands. And yet, he was uneasy. \n\nDeep swig. Another glass. Another memory. A nation forsaken. A hopeless dream beyond reach. \n\nA growing doubt sullied the Emperor's celebration. What had he truly accomplished? Built a state more dysfunctional than any of its predecessors? Calisia may appear to be a colossus, but internally, it was already crumbling. Discord among the four main power blocks turned what was meant to be an organized leadership into a corrupt network of shifting alliances. Should their animosity towards each other grow, they could rip the country to pieces, and he'd be none the wiser. If anything, expanding the disintegrating administration across the entire voivodeship was bound to only lead to more problems. \n\nAnother gulp. This one didn't go down as easily. Ricardus grimaced. A new memory flooded him. A performance. A farce. \n\nHe gazed at the city below, stretching past the horizon. Even in his current state, he could clearly recognize its shortcomings. Provincial at best, its mere sight was enough to dispel any notions of imperial glory. The 'Eternal City' was as poor of an imitation as the Empire itself - a trace of purple paint over a reality no different than before. How long could the facade hold? \n\nA sigh. A few more sips. The bottle had been emptied. The second of the night. A madman. His sacrifice. \n\nHe could see it clearly now - a bustling metropolis of white marble sprawling before him. Old tenements making way for great projects and architectural wonders as far as the eye can see. A harmonious senate presiding over the nation's wellbeing. The strata intermingling, enjoying a new age of prosperity for noblemen and commoners alike. The imperial banner waving across all of Poland. His glorious Calisia... Invicta."

As the initial fervor dissipated and the issue turned into a slow burn, doubt began to grow among Andrzej's band whether, far beyond their reach, the Optimates might slowly be tipping the scales. As for his own part, Paulus was hard at work in the capital, greasing the wheels of democracy with a few essential bribes, favors, and the like. Despite the significant intake of new senators, it proved just as easy to ingratiate himself with the rank-and-file Senators, including pulling along a few of the more... agreeable Populares. Though a lot of time had passed since he last had to utilize his influence, one rule still held true within the halls of power - money does the talking, and there are no limits as to what it can achieve. \n\nAs they camped in their master's estate, slowly running out of what little provisions they had stocked up for their rebellion, all the peasants could do was hope that somehow the initial majority would hold. Was there even ever a majority? At this point, they didn't know whether that was their paranoia or what remained of their rational senses lingering in the backs of their minds. It felt like weeks, months, even, perhaps, for them, nearly like an eternity, but a revolution does not waver. Though all they did was sit idly within the confines of a single property, the revolters styled themselves as commissars of a rapidly approaching global overthrow of the entrenched oligarchy. With each day, they sank further into delusions of grandeur, possibly impacted by their malnourished delirium. \n\nIn a way, the noise of their master's chariot finally returning was cathartic, an end to the torturous uncertainty. They quickly ran to the front porch to confront the man they so strongly reviled. \n- Tyrant! Come to formalize your surrender? In the name of the Free People's Commune of Studzianka, I vow to grant you mercy and let you escape with one item of your choosing should you agree to cooperate. \n- Oh, stop wasting my time, Andrzej. - He tossed him a piece of parchment, nearly hitting his leg in the process. - Read this to the rest of your misfits. It's the bill that just got passed in the Senate. With my significant help, I'd like to add. It's over. Now get back in the field AND EARN BACK EVERY SINGLE DENARIUS YOU COST ME! \nAs he read the contents of the document, the smug dominance of the serf increasingly gave way to a look of utter fear. As if struck by lightning, he dropped to his knees, pleading with his owner to refrain from the vengeance he desired.- Y... yes, master, we are sorry for our lapse in judgment. At once. - He responded humbly, bowing his head. He knew that for the rest of time, the whip would seek out his back on a daily, if not hourly basis."

While he was preoccupied in the capital, throwing money at every senator he could possibly sway to his cause, Andrzej's merry band occupied their master's estate. The landholder knew the situation was dire. The peasants have cut off his main income source, and his pockets have been drying up at an alarming rate. A bribe for some wavering centrists here, a gift for a few volatile Optimates there; it was all costly, but he could always make the denarii back once all goes back to normal. The ungrateful serfs will work double shifts until the loss is fully repaid. And oh, he'll make them pay. \n\nWhen the voting neared, and he was sent back to his manor, Paulus could only hope he had done enough. The confidential letters he was being sent left and right from both sides of the aisle proved he had a considerable majority, perhaps even one too substantial to even be true. He peered through the correspondence, marking every declaration of support on a crumpled piece of paper. Nearly eighty Senators committed to vote along with his interests, every single Optimate, most of the Populares, even a few of the hardliners... Has he overdone it? The landowner began regretting a few of the more panicked donations. \n\nAfter arriving at his estate and briefly making camp in the secondary quarters, Paulus greeted the incoming officer with visible elation. He wasn't really the brutish, military type the oligarch expected, but if he could scare off the peasants into complicity, there was no reason to complain. All was set for the eventual confrontation, as seeing the commotion, the rebels emerged out of the mansion, one by one, awaiting their fate. \n\n- Hmm, okay, how many of you are there? About thirty, yes? - the official began in a bored, administrative tone. \n- Thirty-two, Sir. And we ain't moving. This is our land now! \n\nIgnoring the bickering sides barraging one another with expletives too obscene to document in his final report, the bureaucrat brought out his measuring instruments, circled the entire property, and eventually carved out and delineated a small back corner of the land with an apple tree and two dead shrubs. \n\n- Okay, Mr. Stericus, this plot will be for you. I can send someone over to help you move your property. \n- MY plot? This is the thanks I get for singlehandedly helping those ungrateful bastards kill the reform? They should be showering me with gifts! Tell me right now that they're giving me better land as compensation! I demand an estate by the Prosna! Prebuilt, and with servants that aren't this damn uppity! \n- Umm, yeah, hate to break it to you, Sir..."

Working on fixing up the heavily damaged A2 highway was one exhausting job by all, so what is there to do to kill the time? Three crates of the cheapest wine you could possibly get, of course! The worksite is so far off from the Urbs, or just about anywhere with a pre-Fall population of over a thousand that this was practically the perfect crime.\n\nThe smell of melting asphalt really killed the mood, but cheap booze tasted so much better at the worksite, especially in this weather. It might’ve been diluted spirit with a carton of grape juice and food coloring mixed in, but that’s just the thing for a hard working Legionnaire. This was about the third, maybe fourth time they pulled this stunt. It took the edge off, lubricated the rusty gears of the daily grind. Hell, it even made them feel like working a bit more, when they weren’t all pissed off at their bosses for sending them to dig holes, fill them with rocks and flood it with tarmac.\n\nEverything was fine and dandy at the worksite, until Conradus, another wise guy came running down the length of the site from the gap in the noise-canceling barriers waving his hands like a madman yelling something. Panting and sweating bullets he was finally close enough to actually be intelligible\n\n - Guys! The fucking inspector is coming! Hide the booze!\n\nIn a panicked rush all the Legionnaires sprung into action. They were like clockwork throwing empty bottles in the bushes and burying the still corked ones under loose dirt, near the wheelbarrows. They all grabbed their shovels, or soil compactors and made their best efforts to at least appear as if they were hard at work.\n\nSoon enough there he was, the inspector in his glorious steed - a beat up Fiat Seicento. He stepped out of his car which was tiny compared to his circumference. He walked very carefully through the sand and dirt, careful to not get any excess dust on his very expensive robes. There was a comparatively small badge he wore that proudly stated his very highly esteemed position, which he gained through hard work, as he called it. Though everyone knew he was just a sycophant. With a cursory glance he looked around the worksite and a small smile crept onto his face. This was probably the first worksite he’s seen today that was actually hard at work. They swayed a bit while they worked, but he chalked it up to them being such hard workers. He walked around the site a bit, very nearly missing the pile of dirt covering up the wine, wrote some things down in his notebook and left as he came in his rusty tin can."

calisia.33.desc: "History used to repeat itself, but it never did so self-consciously. Ideas were regurgitated, repacked in cheap, trashy packaging, and then bought by troubled masses. Mixed up fantasies about past and future mangled the minds of men and made the most outrageous outcomes a desirable possibility. Their brunt, physical consequences were skimmed off as flashy display of B-class movie action and pulp fiction tragedy. n\nOnce Poland experienced the Fall, a faint thought appeared in the minds of people of East and West alike, that contrary to a popular saying * something * might indeed happen, and that end of world as it was known was an actual possibility. Once Germany and Russia embroiled themselves in internal strife and civil war, this thought was widely acknowledged. One day people did not simply wake up, but persisted instead in a fever dream, where everything was possible, as long as it kept the stream of consciousness running. \n\nAs waves of refugees moved into Polish successor state known as Calisia, they found themselves in a place somewhat safer, but by far more bizarre. It seemed as a form of coping mechanism, therapy or mass escapism. It did seem helpful – to an extent – but it wasn’t for the refugees. These were aliens, numerous, noisy and downtrodden, disturbing hard-fought peace – and the coping mechanism found a way to cope with that as well. It branded them as barbarians – non-Romans, non-citizens, people of lesser civilisations. It sounded bizarre – as everything did. But, first and foremost, it was humiliating. \n\nAnd so the people of Germania Maior and Scythia, people of states fallen and humiliated, reached for an new-old identity. Men of melting pots and multicultural cities revived quite modern myths of fearsome Teutonic warriors of Teutoburg and ruthless Vandals; of masters of the steppes and scourges of God. They’ve banded once again in the middle of the greatest storm Europe had seen since around a century. In this way, they did not have to feel shame or fear when facing these new Romans."

For the veteran commander, this was the most desired moment of glory. While Solicovus was the brains behind most of the reforms, Vinicius was the face behind the proposal for increased funds for the project. After all, military campaigns are impossible without political ones.

The steady march, the functional yet beautiful armor, the carbines, and those roaring monsters - the artillery guns! One could barely remember the time when Vinicius and Solicovus had to first train them. When the few soldiers they had couldn't even form a testudo after gathering enough police shields and trash can covers. By Tartarus, they couldn't even understand orders in Latin. - I think some of those boys from back then are marching in the approaching column! - Vinicius thought to himself, filled with pride as the legionaries neared the planned position.\n\n - Ave Calisius - Solicovus greeted his Emperor.\n - Ave! - the roaring unicity of legionaries answered. Then, the centurions took command of the soldiers, positioning them as two sets of two rows. Solicovus entered the platform. It was time for Vinicius to give the command that would grace the parade even more. - Honorary salute! - he ordered.\n - Legion! - Solicovus proceeded to carry out the order - Attention! Second row - step back, march! Weapon - on the belt! At ease! Honorary salute! With three - load!\n Between the shots, the artillery outside the capital shot their ordinance as well. It was as if Jupiter himself was one of Calisius's faithful soldiers. The crowd cheered!

Come on Legionary Marek, you still… cameraing this shit?”\n\n“I do, sir!”\n\nJakubowski crawled over to the commander’s entrance, leaned over… and collapsed down the hatch, head-first.\n\nBONK!\n\n“Oh fuck, indeed! Fuck! Owie, everything hurts. Owie owie…. fuck… ow…”\n\n“What the fuck did you fucked out?\n\n“No matter, just hop in with me, we’re going on that… ghoddamn parade…”\n\nMarek quickly enters the hatch and enters the driver’s seat.\n\n“Hey, I think this steering is broken”\n\n“FUCK the stheering, let’s goo!”- Jakubowski said and pulled him out of the drivers seat, taking it for himself” - man the commander post!\n\nNot wanting to get crucified, Marek obeyed and watch his leader drive… and promptly drive over a villa wall, despite Marek’s repeated yells to stop. \n\n Dammit! I’m… hardcore!”- Jakubowski moaned as some woman came out of the villa talking something about them smashing her internet cable.\n\n “Who’s the driver” - a Vigiles came up.\n\n “Not… me… damn “ - Jakubowski crawled out of the hatch (pushing poor Marek out of the way) and staggered back on his feet next to the rubble and the tank. He looked as though he was going to kill the Vigiles and Marek alike."

Catoff his balls, he’s a fucking bugger! He can’t keep his dick in his pants for five minutes! \n– Shut that plebeian mouth! You populars are getting bugged every day! Every day a barbarian dick enters your arse and goes back and forth, back and forth like that – the senatore leaving the rostrum gestured. \n– Enough. Enough. Get back to your seat – tribune ordered. – We shall now begin the vote on.. \n– Formal request, tribune, formal request – a popular trotted towards the rostrum, and before the tribune could say anything, started anew. \n– Optimates have stolen 70 millions denarii meant for the legions fighting in the last war! This money went into their villae and offshore bank accounts! According to this document – he took a shabby scroll out of his toga – they spent one million denarii on victuals for the emperor to placate him, such as: parmesan, spianata romana, mozarella buffala and... \n\nMain door flung open and the chamber fell silent. Senators looked with embezzlement on majestic silhouette standing in the entrance. \n– I thought I’d drop in for a second to look on the proceedings – the emperor said. – Don’t mind me. I’m keen to know if I can get any good mozarella around here. \nChamber froze in an uncomfortable silence. Finally, the tribune started mubling: \n– Maybe we... we could move to the vote on, uhrm – he fumbled through his papers – uhm, where did I put it.. \n– Maybe I could share something from my own parliamentary experience – Calisius said. – First and foremost: don’t treat politics as if it was a total war. Tomorrow you might be forced to work together, or worse – some issue might divide you even further. If you will treat yourself like you’re locked in a conflict that has to end with one of you trampled into the floor and proscribed, you will both be sorry losers. My apologies for these trivialities. Some of you might have less political experience. \n\nServants brought Calisius a golden stool and a platter with wine and antipasti. \n– As I said, don’t mind me. I’m just an ordinary spectator."

calisia.50.desc: "- Your Excellency, I regret to inform you that I have bad news. I'm not entirely sure how to say this because the situation is a bit difficult, but... we don't have any dark bread buns. Will white bread bun do?\nRicardus was standing in line at Ranula's store like any ordinary citizen. But what he heard felt like a slap in the face. After all, he's on a diet and can't eat wheat bread. In fact, he's on three diets because one doesn't meet the caloric requirements, but still - dark bread is sacred.\n- How can there be none? Don't you have deliveries?\n- Well... we do. It's just that... honestly, I have no idea if this bread is good. The new calendar kind of... messed up our calculations.\nNot only insolent but also impudent. He wouldn't feed him, and on top of that, he would complain about his ruler's political decisions. Ricardus's thoughts were growing increasingly aggressive. Hungry, he wasn't himself, but fortunately, his political experience and composure in crisis situations prevailed.\n\n- Alright, in that case, I'll take the white bread.\nThe expression on the clerk's face showed no emotion, but inside his head, an apocalypse was unfolding. He knew that what he was about to say would mean spending the next weekend fighting in the Colosseum, and not at his plot in Colubrega. Despite everything, he took the risk.\n- There's none at all. The sausages are cold. We can't afford the rent. Vandals have painted the store window for the third time. Last month I counted fourteen alcohol thefts. The Empire is going down. The optimates are thieves, and the populares are idiots.\n\nCalisius had not been this shocked in a long time. News of barbarians didn't frighten him. Reports of murders, kidnappings, and war didn't move him. All of this made him start to question his own existence. Was he losing touch with society? Was he becoming the very thing he swore to destroy? How could there not be a hot dog ready for him? Then, as if Calisius had just had an epiphany, he turned to the cashier:\n- Young man, I swear to you... I shall fix this situation. You're right. We can't afford to be without bread in the Empire. Dark, white, any kind! Yes, yes. This must be our priority... and do you maybe have those tasty panini sandwiches that you had on sale?"

calisia.51.t: "Carpe Vinum"
calisia.51.desc: "It was a sunny day. Legate Silvius Iacobinus loved to start such mornings with a stroll to his favorite wine shop to pick up a little something to start the day right. His route typically took him past a large warehouse where various exotic goods for export were stored, including locally produced wines. Oh, the sweetness of tasting the finest drinks produced by the empire. However, Iacobinus’ wine tastings usually ended with persistent requests for more bottles to confirm the quality of the wine, which often led to a mandatory nap by midday.\n\nThis time, however, something was amiss. There was a palpable tension in the air; the situation felt wrong. Not only was the wine shop closed, but shouts could be heard coming from the bank of the river. As a respectable citizen, he went to investigate and save the day. What he saw surpassed his wildest expectations. Workers were pouring wine from barrels into the river, much to the dismay of the local drunks! Silvius considered joining the protest of the town’s riffraff, but suddenly a better idea came to him. He remembered his rank and entered the nearby warehouse like a knight on a white steed.\n\n- Who is the prefect of this establishment?! - legate shouted in a commanding voice. A mediocre official, visibly terrified by this unexpected visit, appeared before him.\n- A-ave Augustus, legate. How can we assist you?\n- What is the meaning of this? WHY ARE YOU POURING OUT THE WINE?! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!\n- Honorable legate, with all due respect, we are unable to sell it. We can't export anything because no one can afford to buy our goods anymore. We have to write it off as a loss... so we're disposing of it. What else can we do?\n\nIacobinus’ eyes lit up as if he had just received a hobo’s dream gift for Christmas. Although at first he wasn’t sure if this wasn’t a dream—since he often fantasized about such a situation, but the lack of alcohol in his system made him very alert. This was his moment.\n- Oy, chief... fetch a cart. I know exactly what to do with this wine. I will take it into my custody. If you have any wine that needs disposal, bring it to my house. Do you know where I live? No? Well, I will tell you. But remember, this is important because it’s an order from the emperor himself. Not a single drop should be wasted. Otherwise, you know the consequences. Now, bottoms up!\n\nAnd so, the imperial wine reserves were saved by the brave legate. He took on a great responsibility, and his sacrifice would not be forgotten. At least by everyone else, because Iacobinus... certainly won’t remember much of it."

calisia.52.t: "Barbari ante portas!"
calisia.52.desc: "- Shields on me! Single formation! - the centurion shouted, trying to arrange his soldiers in formation. Another wave of Germans charged at them in disorder, attempting to break through the disciplined legionaries guarding the limes. This was the third assault in a single day, each growing stronger and more numerous. Yet every time, the Germans either crashed against the limitanei like waves against rocks or were routed by the nearby century of cavalry.\n\nSuch was the case this time when two hundred Germans crossed the Viadrus River to plunder the villages near the fort of Cedene. The infantry engaged the enemy, holding them until the cavalry could strike. The Calisian cavalry was a formidable force, with their scythed chariots instilling terror among the barbarians, mowing down foes like wheat. A swift charge ended in a complete victory, and the legionaries gathered with the equites near the bridge to celebrate their triumph.\n\n- Hey, we save your asses again. Maybe you should learn to win battles on your own?\n- Alright, alright, you know what? Why don't you take that chariot of yours and fetch some wine. The lads are parched.\n- Actually, that's a good idea, comrade. Get a horse, you’ll help me carry it.\n\nAt that moment, a dreadful roar pierced the skies, as if seven trumpets had sounded the apocalypse. For the soldiers on the border, the gates of hell had opened, unleashing demonic cohorts on the hunt. Hundreds, then thousands of silhouettes loomed on the horizon. Yet it was not the thousands of barbarian warriors that froze the entire limes. Leading the charge were enormous war beasts, at least several dozen war elephants advancing to obliterate the civilized world. Drums began to play a terrifying rhythm, completing the vision of catastrophe heading towards the legionaries. Contemplating flight, they knew they were merely reserve soldiers, not seasoned legions. One of the centurions of the equites turned his chariot towards the enemy, donned his helmet, took a deep breath, and commanded:\n- SOLDIERS OF THE EMPIRE, REFORM THE LINE! WE’LL TAKE THEM HEAD ON! CHAAAAAAAARGE!\n\nAnd so, the riders charged forward, racing headlong into death. The rest of the soldiers knew this was the day they feared, when their doom arrived on great beasts to end their lives. Knowing they were already dead no matter what they did, they followed the cavalry in a suicidal charge straight into the abyss, from which none would return."

calisia.53.desc: "- And with two laps to go, the chariot of the Calisian athletes remains firmly in the lead over the Veneti’s rickety cart! Clearly, our representatives are blessed by Mercury to achieve such speeds! Here they are, once again approaching the Western Bend. Watch how gracefully they round the corner... Oh, it appears that the Calisians have lost traction! They’ve crashed into the wall! And that means... no, it is impossible! That means they are out of the race! The Veneti have passed them by! They didn’t even bother to help out our valiant athletes. They slowed down. They are doing a victory lap! How shameful! Ladies and gentlemen, the Veneti have crossed the finish line, and therefore, technically, they have won! \n\nA disappointed murmur spread through the crowd, and the cheers previously rumbling the stadium's foundation deflated in an instant. While the modest delegation of Veneti supporters, crowded in the only corner that the organizers allowed them, had nearly lost their minds in celebration, furiously banging on their massive drums and nearly wrecking the entirety of their section, the Calisians on the other end struggled to process what had just occurred. Slowly but surely, the crowd utilized their combined brainpower to come to the only natural conclusion that could explain how their champions managed to lose to a team of absolute amateurs. \n- Cheaters! \n- They slipped some oil on the track to make our riders crash! \n- We can't let them get away with this! \n- Have at 'em, lads! \n\nFury spread throughout the stadium as if carefully planted and fostered by the goddess Ira. The joyous atmosphere of the event had completely dissipated, and a flurry of jeers and boos greeted the winners during their victory parade. As the main rider for the Veneti team stepped onto the podium and lifted the trophy in front of the frenzied public, he was struck in the head by one of the hundreds of seats thrown from the stands. When he collapsed unconsciously to the ground with a cut across his entire scalp, all remaining pretenses of civility were cast aside as waves of red shirts crashed into the wall dividing the two teams' supporters. It was a bloodbath. Though the away fans tried to hold the line, all exits were barred, and soon, the mass of bodies pushing into them proved too much to bear... \n\n\nEXCERPT FROM THE SPECIAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS ON THE AFTERMATH OF THE SPARTAKIAD: \nEntries: \nCalisians - 18425 // Veneti - 1627 \nApprehended: \nCalisians - 319 // Veneti - 17 \nHospitalizations: \nCalisians - 109 // Veneti - 541 \nDeaths: \nCalisians -  14 // Veneti - 892 \n\nCONCLUSION - Due to the mutual hatred of the populations, it is strongly advised to avoid organizing any future competitions that involve direct competition between Calisian and Venedic athletes. Any such events are to be classified as high-risk, and a Vigiles patrol should remain on standby. It is of utmost importance that, for the good of the Empire, the planning of the second edition of the Spartakiad is to be immediately canceled."

This is your motivation. This keeps you alive. Inhale. Exhale. Repeat. The opening gate lets in a blinding light from outside. The arena is open. Your time has come. For five seconds, your faith does not leave you. You hear a roar. But it is not a human sound; it belongs to a mighty beast. Moments later, the roar is joined by the cheers of the crowd. You stand in the gate, but you are not given any weapon. This is not an ordinary gladiatorial fight. But you still step out, wanting at least for a moment to feel the warmth of the sun’s rays on your skin.\n\nOne step forward, another, then a third. One part of the arena is separated from the other. On the opposite side, you see a legionary armed with a pilum. He is rousing the crowd for greater cheers. You don't see any animals yet. The sound of a horn is heard. The soldier on the other side takes aim. The spear flies in your direction. You don’t have much room to dodge. It misses. The soldier takes a few steps forward. Another spear is stuck in the ground. There are three left in front of him. You must avoid five. Throw. Miss. The distance between you and the legionary is decreasing. Three to go. Behind you, the gate opens. Two handlers lead a lion on a chain. Your maneuvering space is further reduced. Throw. Miss. \n\nThe lion's chain is loosened even more. You are trapped. Throw. You didn't manage to dodge. A tremendous pain pierces you. You fall on one knee, but you try not to faint. The spear is still lodged in your chest. The crowd cheers. They revel in your suffering. Despite everything, you gather the remnants of your strength. The legionary is preparing for the final throw. You hear the announcer counting the points for the legionary. In front of you lies one of the pilum that missed you. You pick it up with enormous effort. You don't have much time left. Your head starts to spin, your vision darkens. You thrust the spear at the contestant at the same moment he throws his. You don't know if you hit.\n\nYou fall to the ground. A huge applause sweeps through the arena. The last thing you hear is the crowd demanding the lion be unleashed. The sand you lie on is so warm. The taste of blood in your mouth doesn't even bother you. They didn't lie. Now, you can finally be free. You take your last breath. The lion will finish the job. Fortunately, you will no longer experience the pain of being torn apart. The Elysian Fields are already open to you. Darkness surrounds you. Or is it Hades? You become nothingness. This is the end."

calisia.55.t: "Conventus Subitis"
calisia.55.desc: "Dies Solis, 19:00. A crisis group of five High Quaestors assembled to discuss the ramifications of the new Ricardine Calendar. Since the founding of the Imperium Calisianum, their Quintumvirate has stood as the final authority on all financial matters, often having to hurriedly adjust the budget to plug the money drain caused by some Senator's ill-considered bill. Nothing suggested today's session would be any different. \n\nAs they began poring over the countless ledgers they had already mostly memorized, the most senior of the officials, their Primus Inter Pares, broke the silence to detail the day's agenda. \n\n- Alright, so the Emperor, in his infinite wisdom, has just erased about a decade from the calendar. Guess that only screws up about... every single payment made over that period. No pressure. Any ideas? - His usual commanding tone betrayed a sense of consternation. \n- Hmm, so if the dates are going forward, that means we owe the legions around ten years of salaries. - One of the quaestors barged in before his predecessor could even finish speaking, desperately talking over anyone who tried to get a word in. - But that also means we get all the extra taxes, right? So it balances out? \n- Pretty sure it goes backward, Patricius. So literally none of that is true. \n- Yeah, nah. It's definitely backward. - An official of a particularly canine appearance chimed in. - In that case, they are the ones returning their salaries. \n- Wait, does that include us? \n- Hmm, okay, maybe scratch that then. Or give us an exception. \n- Hold on, if we just erase ten years of our records, then, technically, everybody born in the last decade does not exist yet. \n- It's the other way around, Matthius. - a voice interrupted smugly - If the time moves forward, then they're just older. And need to pay back taxes. \n- No! HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT IS NOT FUCKING MOVING FORWARD! \n\nThough the buildup of tension managed to find its unavoidable release, and the atmosphere remained friendlier than the usual meeting, the increasing desire of the High Quaestors to return to their homes and get some actual sleep before the next week began forced them to at least come up with a compromise good enough not to collapse the Empire's whole administrative and financial systems as soon as the markets opened in the morning. Previously silent, the group's unofficial diplomat gave his own two sesterces on the matter. \n\n- Alright, we aren't going to come up with anything today. Let's just bump the issue down to the local level and have the lower ranks deal with it individually. If something works, we copy it in all the other precincts. \n\nA conflicted murmur spread throughout the room. Everyone involved knew it was an insufficient solution, but it was the best one they were going to get. An agreement was reached, and now, it was time to celebrate it with a few cups of cheap wine."

calisia.56.desc: "The former border crossing at the former city of Słubice had become one of the most volatile points in the entire region. On the German side, Frankfurt had transformed from a town of 50,000 into a sprawling enclave of hundreds of thousands of people fleeing from areas engulfed in anarchy and civil war. Refugee ghettos began to form in the heart of the city, growing larger by the day and pressing eastward. Meanwhile, the unyielding Imperial Border Guard stood watch on the Viadrus River, allowing no one to cross the border, constantly intercepting illegal immigrants attempting to ford the river on their own. Yet, even the reinforced limitanei could not control the waves of refugees clamoring at the gates of Calisia.\n\nToday, a meeting was scheduled on the bridge between a representative of the barbarians and the border post officer, Adalbertus Crudeliter. Adalbertus was calm, having already dismissed numerous German envoys who had come to beg for passage. He expected this encounter to be no different. Ten meters behind him stood two soldiers ready for anything. Approaching him were three tall barbarians. Only one of them stepped forward to Adalbertus and nodded in greeting. Officer pulled a Polish-German phrasebook from his pocket, quickly flipping through the pages to find the right phrase.\n- GUTEN MORGEN - Adalbertus shouted, pleased with himself. Unfortunately, it was five minutes past noon, making the greeting irrelevant.\n- Guten Tag, Herr Offizier- the envoy replied.\n\nThe entire "conversation" dragged on painfully long, as each sentence had to be manually translated, making any real dynamic negotiation impossible. Calm and composure gave way to frustration and anger, which began to simmer in the envoy. At Adalbertus’s next suggestion that they might return to their homes, the barbarian snapped and shouted,\n- SIE ZERSTÖRT UNSERE HÄUSER, WO SOLLTEN WIR GEHEN?\n- Hey, hey, no need to get upset, alright? - Adalbertus’s hand briefly landed on the hilt of his gladius. He knew "Hause" meant home, but what was "zerstört"? He quickly flipped through the dictionary to the "Z" section, and what he found made his blood run cold. It means “Destroy”.\n\n- You... maniac, you’ve gone too far. You want to destroy? You want to plunder our homes? You'll get what you deserve! Men, seize them!\nWith these words, the Calisians lunged at the bewildered Germans, who had no idea what was happening. They tried to defend themselves, but this only convinced the legionaries that the barbarians intended to attack them. After killing the three envoys, Adalbertus ran to the post, raising the general alarm along the entire border. Observing from the other side of the river, the refugees were stunned, but not for long. What followed was an enormous surge of fury from the crowd, which charged straight at the post. Shots were fired. This small misunderstanding was about to change the course of history."

calisia.57.desc: "– Marcus Vinicius came to visit you – a voice broke through a calm sound of flowing water. Calisius wiped his glasses from steam. A man in legionary armor walked through his private thermae towards tepidarium, where he currently lounged. \n– Ave, Caesar. May all gods grant you fortune, especially Asclepius and Cipride. \nThe emperor grumbled. – Of all the gods, why would you think I need Cypride the most? Do I look like I would be in need of her assistance? – he rose from the pool, extending his arms as to present the nuda veritas of his outward appearance. – Don’t you feel like we’ve had this exact conversation before? \n– My apologies, o emperor. This was like... an involuntary reaction to this situation. I could really use a longer stay in the termae myself. \n– Oh Marcus, you know you can use my thermae whenever you need – Calisius gave him a wry smile. \n– You’re as gracious as ever, my emperor. – Vinicius bowed sharply. – Forgive me, for I have to refuse. I’m entirely overtaken by military matters. \n– Surely you could lend your duties to your assistants for some time. \n– It is not possible. All officers are constantly occupied. We’re understaffed on all lines, and men are taking leaves en masse. They don’t want to stay in camp on meagre pay while they could work at home. \n– It would be wiser for them to stay on the frontlines. – Calisius nodded and two servants rushed with a sizeable towel. The emperor climbed out of the pool and draped himself like he would in a toga. – How much would it take to keep more of them at arms? \n– It’s the fault of the system, my emperor. Our army is designed to be mobilised in full only during the season most appropriate for campaings. Once it has ended, most of the men ought to go back to the job marked or fieldwork, lest we ruin our economy. \n– You know full well we have to work with what we got. But I suppose we could pay less men full time for their better performance. \n– We could make the legions into a professional force. However, I’m afraid this would create a professional caste of warriors, separate from the rest of our citizens. \n– If you have an alternative in mind to an professional army, voice your opinion – Calisius said drily. \n– We could enroll more non-citizens as auxiliary troops. Allow them to defend Calisia like it was their homeland. This would give them a chance to improve their lot, and, perhaps, foster some loyalty. \nEmperor gestured vaguely, as if thinking of an argument."

He had a laurel on his head – which seemed overly theatrical, even for someone like him. \n– Ave, emperor. You’ve requested for a private conference with me. \n– Sit down, Kinastowski – Calisius gestured to the chair in front of the desk. It was an ordinary office chair, as normal as could be. As he sat, the pretorian realised the room was completely unromanised – which only made the sight of emperor’s toga and his armor somewhat uncomfortable. \n– You are aware of the newest reports, right? – Calisius asked. \n– Of course, my emperor. I’ve mobilised the pretorian guard, they’re ready to march at on.. . \n– I wouldn’t call you here just to brief you on obviousness. I’m asking you whether you are aware what is happening. \n– I beg your pardon, sire... \n– If someone five years ago would tell you there’s a slave rebellion happening just an hour drive from your home, what would you do? \n– I was always against terrorism and acts of violence targeted at... \n– No. A * slave * rebellion. Think about it, Kinastowski. We have *slaves and now they are *killing landowners. You would think I lost my mind if I implied it could happen here, and not in some sort of Bantustan or whatever. \nThat’s it, Cinastovicus thought. He’s actually losing his mind. An impulsive grin appeared on the pretorian’s face, but he collected himself at a blink of an eye. – You must be joking, my emperor. You’re the one who had shown us the way to our current glorious... \n– I did not show the way for an accursed slave rebellion! – Calisius erupted, slamming his fist on the shamble desk. – Who do you think I am? A slave driver for your petty friends to get fat out of this miserable land? This madness has to be fini... – he paused for a while, breathing heavily, adjusting his glasses and, curtly, his laurel. – This has to be corrected. Populares are calling for abolishing slavery as it is now. I think it’s quite sensible as it is. You can surely acknowledge that it’s better to have an indentured servant that a slave that’s ready to cut your throat. \n– My apologies, oh divine emperor, but now it is too late. These are barbarians; it’s in their nature to cut throats. You don’t extend a hand to a beast that wants to bite you. Slaves will know their place... – „or you won’t have yours", Cinastovicus ended in mind. \n– Thankfully you’re not the one who’s making all the decisions here. Order pretorians to stand easy, for now. "

calisia.73.t: "Operation ''Housecleaning''"
calisia.73.desc: "- Just stick to the plan and everything will go smoothly. Alright, let's move out. \n\nThe job was simple: sneak up through the treeline, watch out for any threats and get out with as many captured women as possible. Then, pack ''the loot'' onto the trucks waiting in the forest and get away from there before any resistance shows up. \nThe targets were in the border settlement of Bycz, located near the pre-Fall border between Kuyavia and Greater Poland. \n\nAt first, it seemed like the Amazonians abandoned the village: no armed personnel was in sight, the closest signs of enemy activity being located almost a kilometer away, at the small checkpoint set up in Wyrobki. After the drone operator made sure noone was watching them, the men surrounded the village and simultaneously broke into the first few buildings, with the intent of giving the victims the least time to reacWATCH OUT, MINE! \n\nIn a moment, the entire group was thrown onto the ground by an explosion that ripped away half of plot #30. Immedeatly after, an entire company of soldieresses jumped the group from two sides and disarmed it in a matter of seconds. Soon after, the invaders were taken to the local fire station, rounded up, knocked out and stuffed into InPost vans awaiting them in the garages. \n\n...\n\nNorthern Calisian borderlands, early in the morning. The local garrison's commander has just woken up, teeming with excitement. His boys must have just returned with the targets! Oh, how delightful!... this calls for a celebration! \n\nThe man got up, put on his comfy clothes, grabbed his wallet and ventured outside, towards the local Dino. Hmm... will it be a couple beers? No, it must be something fancier. OH! How about some rum? Rum with morning coffee sounds nice. Or how about a nice wine? After all, we're Romans now, right? \nAnd so, the jolly commander marched on, wondering to himself what should he pick. As he reached the market's parking, his thoughts lingered around the liquor shelf for a moment. \n\nThat's also where he found his platoon. \n\nLying unconscious in their underpants, heads stuffed into the parking's Paczkomat."

calisia.74.t: "Argumentum ad Tuam Vestram"
calisia.74.desc: "The nascent forum of Calisia was bustling with the sound of combat. Empty wine jugs were already expired, and the mob begun resorting to cobblestone and roof tiles. Forces of order – the few that came in the first place – did not attempt to stop the riot. Instead, they focused their measly forces on escorting two perplexed men from the middle of the square to one of the tenement houses. \n\n– Well... –  mumbled one of them – I never suspected philosophy could move people to such lenghts. \n– That’s not philosophy, that’s alcoholism – answered the other. – Still, the fact they did care to listen a bit was a surprise. \n– If only they could tune in in some different moment. I’m afraid hearing about the Caracalla edict somewhat agitated them. \n– I wanted to tell you it wasn’t prudent to mention that name. It resembles karakan too much. \n– Well, it was bound to happen, then. You can’t have discussion on citizenship without mentioning Caracalla. \n– You could and you should. It was passed centuries after Roman empire entrenched itself in the barbarian lands. The people were well romanised by that stage. \n– Oh, but *we* are not well romanised. We have all underwent a very simple transformation within those few years. Now, with our centralised, legitimate government, this process is even faster. \n– Our government barely makes the barbarians bathe once a week. They won’t become Calisians in a million years. Not if they actually try to act like us. \n– Look, you’re just mistaking the urban culture with some Calisian identity. Yes, they may lack the city manners we’re accustomed to, but this is just a matter of living conditions and not... \n– Calisians from Calisia built this empire and no one else. You’re trying to imply this all happened because of some kind of fluke? \n– Why would it matter? Weren’t we all one people before? Were we not Poles? Weren’t the Romans just one of the Italian tribes n the first place? \n– Poles, yeah, maybe, maybe they could be Calisians. But barbarians? How could they comprehend this? They started from a waay different point than we did and they don’t feel like they’re at home, do they? If Calisian is an evolution of a Pole, then they should evolve into something of their own. If they even could comprehend that. \n– Don’t you think that maybe, maybe we could use this opportunity fate gave us? That we have a new-old, pliable culture that can unite everyone, like Roman culture did? That we can make a better world by drafting a whole new home, that will finally fit all of us? \n\nFor a second there was a considerable (as for the fight raging outside) silence. \n– „That will fit all of us”? Last night your father said that about your mother when he wanted to join in. \nThere was a crack, and once again no one on the Calisian Forum tried to solve problems with discussion."

True, chairs were replaced by lecti triclinaria, and paintings have been replaced with grotesques or pseudo-marble busts, but it had the same proportions and  as a certain room from long ago, located in a television studio far away, behind a few political and cultural borders. Shot was just about to begin, and cameras were aimed at a middle aged, somewhat unkempt man entering the room. \n\n– No, noo, what the fuck is that? – the director shouted. – Shave me that oaf immediately!" \nStaff members looked at eachother in confusion. \n– What... You mean we should... \n– He has a goddamned moustache! He looks like a barbarian! This is supposed to be a show about Romans! Poor Romans, drunk Romans, lowliest Romans of them all – but Romans! I ain’t be running with that – he sighed. – Marcus, get a razor and take him to the makeup room. \n – I’m not going to shave – the actor stated. Director exhaled once again, barely containing anger. \n– Andreas, you’re making five grand here. You’re not in the position to complain. Please, be a Roman and shave that fucking moustache. \n– Look, you’re missing the point here. We’re not making a show about Romans. It’s about Calisians. \n– Darling, I know, I know, some people out there still wear facial hair like it was 2023. If I wanted to make a documentary, I’d go to National Geographic. But here – we’re making a TV show that’s supposed to convince people that no matter how deep they’ve fallen into the dumps, they are still Romans. And they should act like Romans. Including wearing facial hair like Romans do. And that Sarmatian-disco-catfish moustache does not fall into that category. \n– Say what you want, I’m not shaving it. Fire me, if you want. I do this job with moustache or I don’t do it at all. \n\nAir was so tense you could mistake it for plusquamperfectum. Director wiped his hand across his face and started anew. \n– Imagine that: your working wife is coming home from backbreaking work at an ambulatorium and sees your proletarian ass reclining on the lectus, drinking wine with your dumbass son. Instead of asking you if you’ve been searching for a job, she has to ask you: „Why didn’t you shave yet? Were you at the tonsor?". And what are you going to say? \n– Well... „I weren’t, because there is no tonsor for people of my gravitas"."

calisia.77.t: "Senatus PopulusQue Barbarianus"
calisia.77.desc: "The entirety of the debate surrounding the Barbarian Integration Program had felt patronizing, to say the least. Had he not been naturally drawn towards centers of power, Donaldus Tusc would have seriously considered reneging on his deal with the Calisians, but, unfortunately, the good of the Germanic peoples required him to swallow up what remained of his pride and politely show up in the Senate as ordered. Barred from wearing a toga to avoid anyone accidentally thinking he belonged within the building’s pristine marble walls, Donaldus was forced to endure the shame of wearing a bright, state-provided hi-vis with the word 'BARBARI' plastered across the whole length in massive letters, almost as embarrassing for his dignity as having to stand in pairs with his compatriots while seemingly every available Optimate has come down to sneer at them. Wandering aimlessly around the meandering corridors felt like some sort of cruel torture, and they were close to heading out and abandoning the whole ordeal until, at last, Senator Compa was able to step in and break their suffering. \n\n- Ah, Mr. Tusc, how wonderful of you to join us. I apologize for the... close-mindedness of my colleagues. Teaching them basic manners proved to be quite a challenge. \n- No worries, Consul. - the barbarian answered stoically. - I expected to be demonized from the moment I stepped foot on Polish... uh... Venedic soil. Bad memories, you see. \n- I'm... truly sorry to hear that. I hope this opportunity will be able to make up for it somewhat. I don't suppose you've had the chance to witness the democratic process firsthand before \n- Hmm, let's just say I've dabbled with something similar back home. - Tusc answered with a faint smile, concealing the tear forming in the corner of his eye. \n\nAfter being led by their patron to the upper gallery and told to 'Enjoy the show,' the barbarian delegation rested in their theater seats to discuss the finer particulars of Calisian politics to the tune of the crunching sounds of the mountains of popcorn and the slurping of soft drinks provided by the Populares. Once their chatter subsided, the lights dimmed, and one by one, in came the senators, with Consul Compa immediately taking center stage. \n\nCountrymen, this truly is a momentous occasion. Despite the fearmongering of the Optimates, we have made great strides towards social acceptance. And thus, as a symbol of this progress, this session of the Senate will be watched by a loyal group of Barbari leaders! I would like to officially thank... \n\nLoudly, Andreas Compa fell to the floor, pushed by Consul Caletus in his bid to seize the pulpit. \n\n- Yeah, yeah, let's all welcome the coming doom of our Empire. Ingenious, Andreas, really, you sly bastard. Bring them in, replace all the Calisians with barbarian scum, and laugh in our faces as everything we've built crumbles to dust. Let me tell you something, Andreas! If you think you can turn your back on Calisia, you are gravely mistaken. I will make sure every last one of these mongrels gets deported back beyond the limes! And, Jupiter be my witness, if even the Emperor himself dares stand against me, I will make sure he meets the same end as every other traitor! \n\nAs he emptied the bag, eating multiple flakes at a time, enthralled in the displays of political grandstanding, Tusc wondered to himself, chuckling."

calisia.80.desc: "Journal of Remigius Savicus, Day 5\n\nThe Balticum’s coast is calm as ever. It doesn’t feel much different here than near Svina Ostium. Our expedition is camped out in a small Calisian outpost between the cities of Zinnowitz and Zemplin. Despite the... rowdy nature of the Germans our team’s mission has been going decently well. \n\nStatistics from before Germania’s dissolution show that larger settlements that we’ve visited up to this point seem to be missing on average 47% of their population. Countryside villages seem to be experiencing an opposite effect, with an influx of refugees from more urbanized centers. Barter seems to have entirely replaced the use of formal currency, however Calisian Denarii have already found their way into circulation, even before the Legions’ arrival.\n\nCome morning, we’ll leave the encampment after receiving additional fuel and supplies for the road. There are still multiple villages in our plans before reaching Wolgast and many more before Greifswald.\n\nJournal of Remigius Savicus, Day 7\n\nPeenemunde and its airport. Thus far this has been the biggest sign of Calisian presence in the newly conquered lands. Owing to its small port and aforementioned airfield, the Legionnaires and even some eager citizens are already making the village and its surroundings their new home. \n\nSignage for the settlement’s Calisian name is already replacing ones denoting its former Germanic name, with any mentions of the old name being scraped from existence. To our knowledge, no other newly-conquered land has taken to adopting a latinized name. Most of the village’s native population has either left for the countryside, or has been forcefully expelled by the region’s administration.\n\nThe airport has become a Legionnaire hub of sorts, with command of the Wolgast area residing here instead of the city itself. Apparently the city isn’t in a state to host any kind of administration. We’ll soon see for ourselves, as that will be the next stop on our voyage.\n\nDay 8\n\nMass graves. Dozens of them, ones that we’ve found at least. We were forewarned of Wolgast’s devastation, but not in our darkest dreams did we expect to see the sights laid out before us. Almost half the city has been burnt down to the ground. According to information we could get from the city garrison’s officer, most of the burnt down buildings were already in that state before the Legions marched into the city. The same went for most of the mass graves. \n\nThey killed each other. Tore at one another’ necks when their Confederation started to crumble. From a previous population of approximately 13000, we could only locate little over a thousand. Starvation led to desperation, desperation led to barbarism and barbarism brought the decimation of a city. We encountered grotesque sights along the way, but this is too much for me to stomach."

calisia.81.t: "Filius Fortunatus"
calisia.81.desc: "All my life, I've been out of luck. Born on the wrong side of the wall separating the Plebeian District from the Senatorial Quarter, I've had to live in the shadow of those ungrateful brats ever since. When my father wasn't busy getting drunk off his mind at the Temple of Bacchus, he'd try to reassert his authority in the house with a belt and a whip. I learned to run away whenever I heard his footsteps coming. Through a crack in the barrier, I slipped past to watch the ruling class' progenies, pampered with luxury and ordering their servants around without a care in the world. Guess that's where their disregard for our lives began. But I ain't no Senator's son, so no shortcuts will I receive. \n\nNow, as I sharpen my gladius and prepare for war, the prospect of their command remains no less terrifying. I look at my superior, barely old enough to serve, fail miserably to raise our legion's spirit. Ave Calisia, he shouts. Ave Calisia, I murmur in response. He orders us to march alone through the Marconian Forest. Walk behind enemy lines, he says. I fight the urge to protest, to let him know it's bound to be an ambush. But I ain't no millionaire's son, so to my death, I march. \n\nOur legion pushes through the forest, the crowns keep darkening the sky. The man before me, my sole guiding lantern, I know not his name, for he too is expendable. When an arrow pierces his skull, I do not shed a tear. He fulfilled his duty; died bravely for his country. Perhaps they'll tout him as a hero, give him a proper burial and a fancy grave. But I ain't no military son, so forgotten shall my service be. \n\nWhen the sound of drums filled the air, and Germanic chants drowned out my hearing, I watched my legion disintegrate as the soldiers ran for their lives in every available direction. I considered fleeing too, trying to save myself from the barbarian onslaught, but what point was there really to it? I was trained to fight, born to die, and I deserved no better than to rest by an unnamed tree's bark. So I stood, swung my sword as ordered until an axe's cleave ripped through my chest. Wounded, I collapsed onto the soft moss, as I drew my final breath. I clutched my dog tag, "Iacobus Melnicus" it said. Maybe somebody will find it, maybe they'll honor my memory. But I ain't no fortunate son, so among the roots, it will remain."

We’re on with the show. We’ll grill them for long enough they will feel like Catilina on the couch with five Ciceros behind them. Remember: stay outta senate chamber, we don’t want any images of praetorians behind the senators, it won’t sit right. \n– Yes, sir. No one enters, no one leaves. \n– Great. I’ll be speaking first, then Scarginsis, then… \nThe doors of the chamber opened with impetus. \n– There’s problem. They found out. \n– What? \n– The populars know. They are debating whether to leave. \n– Shit. Shit. Get more men upstairs. Cut off every door. If they trynna leave, push them back. Gently – Caletus replied. – We’re getting in with the lictors. \n\nDoors opened, and the optimates walked into a boiling sea of white togae and livid heads, screaming wildest insults at them. Lictors, who should be following the putchists, had to make way for them down to the rostrum. \n– This is a breach of the sanctity of Senate! I shall not allow this! \nCaletus was just about to give in to his impulse and answer, as anybody would answer in his position. \n– I am the se... \nWait. This was not a popular-alligned senator. This was an optimate. A left-leaning one, but still. Some minor chair-filler squeezed in there just to keep the votes going. What was his name? Agrippa? Agrippa who? Agrippa Apapus, a thought sparked in Caleta mind, and he chuckled inside. So much he lost track of what he was going to say. \n– What the fuck are you doing? You’re ours! \n– What the fuck are *you* doing? That’s supposed to be a coup? Who do you think you are? Some kind of run-of-the-mill usurper that will be thrown into Prosna after one week! \n– You’re with the populars? Did barbarians pound your ass too hard? Get lost! \n– I will! Do whatever you will, I won’t participate in that! I’m leaving! \n\nAs the senator made his way to the door, an officer walked into the chamber and spread his arms, trying to stop him. Damn idiot, Caletus thought. The noise was deafening. Lictors made their way up to apprehend the fugitive. \n– Out of my way, you lackey – Agrippa tried to shove him away. Praetorian pushed him back. Gently. Elderly senator flew back onto lictors, onto their fasces, and then down on the floor. Blood stained the toga. \n\nSenators lividly rushed onto lictors and towards the doors. Praetorians marched in, forming a cordon and pushing senators down the stalls. Caletus and his retinue grabbed onto the rostrum, watching as the man on the floor is trampled. As the soldiers moved in, all of senators were reduced into a huddled mass, squeezed into their seats, silenced by a series of gunshots. Two praetorians grabbed barely breathing Agrippa and shoved him onto his seat, where his body spread out, uncouscious, with his bared chest discoloured from numerous bruises. \n– Uh, we shall start today’s extraordinary session of the senate with vote on exclusion of following traitors, cowards and barbaric adherents from their offices...

calisia.89.desc: "For Adrianus, there rarely was a day in any way more noteworthy than the rest. Other than the customary few beers sipped on the couch with the faintest sense of enjoyment after a day of backbreaking work, there was little for the aging welder to actually look forward to. Over the three decades of his meager 'career,' spent mostly on the same worksite, in the same position, under the same manager, and with the same inflation-unadjusted salary that barely sufficed to make ends meet, he’d long since learned to forego any ambition and simply do his best to diligently fly under the radar. Thus, he was more than surprised when he learned his performance caused him to accidentally stumble into the title of 'model worker,' entitling him to a hefty cash prize awarded directly by Princeps Ignatius. \n\nWith a newfound sense of purpose, or perhaps simply to avoid the consequences that embarrassing the company would bring, Adrianus set out to prepare for what was undoubtedly his life’s biggest occasion. Doing a neat shave for once, searching the backs of drawers for his sole passable flannel, telling the missus to sew back the missing buttons, whipping out the old press to iron out the creases, alright, let’s try it on... ugh, yeah, no chance that’s gonna fit... \n\n- Helenia! Buy me a new flannel, will ya? This one must’ve shrunk in the wash or something! \n\nAll in all, it took nearly a week of the poor welder’s efforts to reach a state most affluent urbanites would refer to as 'acceptable.' Still, the effortless gallantry of the Princeps, covered in fine fabrics and with the softness of someone whose hardest responsibility was lifting his wine cup, clashed sharply with Adrianus’ rugged image. Though, normally, he’d learned not to care for any authority, the regal aura exuded by Ignatius was more than enough to intimidate him. \n\nWith a learned sense of aristocratic politeness, the heir to the Calisian throne shook the hand of the overwhelmed workman, congratulating him for his achievements with a barely disguised disinterest. And when the massive cheque was wheeled in by the Princeps’ servants, the sum larger than any Adrianus had previously seen, the recipient could feel himself hyperventilating in anticipation. \n\n- I now bestow upon thee this here prize for your efforts to advance Calisian labor. May it serve you and your comrades well once you split it among yourselves. \n- Split? M... my lord, I thought that this reward would be all mine. \n- Oh, no, no. That would be unfair to your other colleagues. Labor is a collective effort, after all. I’m sure they worked just as hard, and you know how wrong it would be to play favorites. \n- B... but... what would that leave me? \n- About 20 Denarii, give or take. Now, how about you all use the money to celebrate? I heard from my father that the Ranula nearby offers great hotdogs. You should definitely try them out. \n- Y... yes my lord - Adrianus answered, the sense of disappointment crushing his very being."

calisia.92.desc: "Though the usual clamor of his legions was nothing to overlook, the noise of the crowd gathered at the Forum Calisianum made an impression even on the decorated legate Vinicius. During all the trials he endured overseeing the Empire's many campaigns, he hardly ever had a chance to sit back and revel in the moment. What for others was an event of absolute importance, the first peaceful crowning in Calisia's history, was little more than an overdue vacation for the grizzled commander. As dignitaries hurried to and fro in a Sisyphean bid to ensure every single element of the ceremony was perfectly planned, organized, and executed, Marcus Vinicius lounged in his seat with a cup of Latium wine. Due to the harsh reality of legionary existence forcing him to repeatedly both drown his sorrows and celebrate his victories with cheap booze, he could hardly remember the last time he had the opportunity to sample the late Emperor's favorite liquid pleasure. He winced. It was far too sweet for his simple tastes. \n\n- How are you finding the wine, Marcus? We might need you to take care of the stockpiles now that Ricardus is gone. - A friendly voice asked politely, taking the padded seat next to the legate. \n- You know it's not my way to muse about the finer qualities of wine, Andreas. Though it's... pleasant, I suppose. A fine way to honor the memory of a fallen titan. \n- As if any such compliments could come close to representing his lofty heights. - He sighed. - Things won't be as easy now without his guidance. \n- No, they won't, but I guess that's why you got me here, isn't it? \n- Perhaps. Tell me, Marcus, isn't it tiring spending your whole life in a military camp? You've done a remarkable job serving the Empire on the frontlines, but now, we need you here. With all the comforts we could provide, it would almost be like an early retirement. \n- You know it's neither the money nor fame I do all of this for, Andreas. If Ignatius requires me in the capital, I am at his service and ready to move in an instant.\n- Speaking of Princeps Ignatius... ahem, Imperator Ignatius, what do you make of him? I don't doubt the blood of Ricardus coursing through his veins, but I worry whether he'll be able to live up to his father's level. It pains me to think what might happen should the burden of ruling overwhelm him. \n- I wouldn't be so quick to jump to such conclusions. He's a good lad and his heart is in the right place. That's all that matters. Even took him on a campaign once when he was younger. If he's half as sharp now as he was back then, Ricardus has left the Empire in capable hands... \n- ...and should he require assistance learning the ropes, well, I suppose that's where we come in. So, cheers, Marcus. To the health of our new Emperor! \n\nAs the two officials slowly sipped their wines in celebration of the bright future that seemed to lay before the Imperium Calisianum, a future they helped achieve, a loud gasp spread through the crowd as Ignatius collapsed to the ground in the middle of the ceremony. When the Emperor stood back up and dusted off his regal robes, they couldn't help but share a hearty laugh."

His plebeian and vulgar approach to life meant he spent most of his time in his basement, which he called an apartment, playing video games. He had spent the last few days consuming pizza and wine, with no contact with the outside world. Upon leaving his block, he was in for an apocalyptic shock.\nThe city was engulfed in smoke. Some buildings still smoldered, streets were strewn with ash and rubble. No one was in sight, everything around either closed or burned. Absolute silence reigned over the city. The world had ended, and no one had informed Quintus of this fact.\n- What happened here? AM I IN HADES? But why would it look like Calisia?\nHe decided to walk towards Caesar’s Square near the market, hoping to see a living human soul. In the gate of one tenement, he saw one of the local homeless bum, pushing his belongings in a small cart. The man looked like he had just come out of the arms of Pluto. Upon seeing Quintus, he beckoned him with a hand gesture.\n- Dominus, can you spare three denarii because I need to get out of the city, and it’s hard to go sober.\n- Alright, if you tell me why everything looks like the end of the world around here.\n- Oh! I know what happened, I see everything, I hear everything! It’s those barbarians! They set the whole city on fire! And they say our emperor is dead! Burned him alive and crucifi..!\nAt that moment, they heard screams from a nearby building and saw praetorians emerging from the staircase, dragging a family out onto the street. They were terrified, and the praetorians seemed smug and even happy to torment the civilians. Why? Well, Quintus and the homeless man were about to find out, as the soldiers immediately spotted them.\n\n- Hey, you there! Stop! - one of the praetorians shouted. The two men were too scared to move.\n- By imperial decree, everyone must go to the Forum Calisianum. No staying at home, go and celebrate! - The praetorian's words made no sense. The city was in ruin, and they were supposed to celebrate?\n- Ah... what’s the occasion? Did I sleep through some holiday? - Quintus asked uncertainly. The praetorian gave him a piercing look that made him wince.\n- The tyrant is dead. You are free.\n- Oh. Right, tyrannicide. A movable feast, that’s why I forgot. I understand. Of course. Yes, we will naturally go to the forum. Freedom, I love and understand. I can’t give up freedom, yes, yes.\nQuintus’s panicked tirade was interrupted by the second praetorian, who was pushing the family they had previously dragged out.\n- And make sure they get there too. Because if not... we know where you live.\n- Of course, sir! We’ll watch them. Take care of them! Say, you don’t happen to know if there is any Ranula open at this hour? I really need some wine - hobo didn’t know where to shut up. But surprisingly, the soldier replied.\n- Go to the warehouse on Via Aurea. They’ll fetch you some Latium wine. Remember to raise your toast to praetorian prefect."

calisia.97.desc: "- Glory to the liberatores! - With these words, the Praetorians raised a toast, celebrating their tyrannicide in the emperor's palace. In the chamber where the emperor once ruled, the fate of the empire was now being decided. The most important prefects had been gathered by their commander, Christianus Cinastovicus, who, for the first time in many years, did not hide his satisfaction.\n- Dear colleagues, comrades, I salute you all, individually and collectively. Our plan was executed flawlessly; we achieved everything we set out to do, and the execution was impeccable. I could not have accomplished this without your dedication. The entire project was fraught with numerous variables, and it is truly a miracle that we brought it to fruition without radical changes. I have dreamed of this day since I was unceremoniously removed from my position as city president. They took away what I had fought for years in an instant, as if it were a mere toy taken from a naughty child. But a child, just like an adult, can burn down the whole house. Revenge is sweet, as they say. But this wine is even sweeter, and finally, after so many years, I can say without hesitation: cheers!\n\nAfter the stirring speech, the prefects moved to the adjacent room, where Cinastovicus took the emperor's seat, opened a file of documents, and pulled out a letter.\n- Gentlemen, before we continue with our well-deserved hedonist practices.. one last business matter. Tomorrow we will wake up in a new Calisia. We have our fingers on the pulse, and it is up to us to determine the colors of tomorrow's dawn. Here, I have a letter from Consul Caletus. It contains support for our cause and readiness to act if necessary. In short, the Optimates want to align with us. They dream of a renewed republic. Without monarchs.\n\n- If there is no emperor, what then is the purpose of the Praetorian Guard? asked one of the prefects.\n- To hell with the Optimates! To hell with the republic! We have them all in our grasp! Let’s do what we must! Let us appoint our own emperor - another official raised his voice.\n- Gentlemen, we should at least weigh the pros and cons. Such a decision cannot be made hastily! They offer us support, which would help us avoid unnecessary casualties, and we would have a solid foundation. And the Optimates... they can always be controlled.\n- Try controlling that madman Caletus - Gaius Ceplus, who had been silent until then, spoke up. - Optimates are animals. All they care about is a bribe in their pocket and a seat in the Senate. They are ready to unleash hell if it means being re-elected for another term. Do you think the Populares were traitors for letting the barbarians in? They did it in accordance with their own views. Caletus would debase himself with the very king of the Goths if it meant his faction would continue to rule.\n- We lack political backing, and administratively we are spread too thin. We cannot govern solely with a strong military, which we do not fully control either...\n\nAfter hearing a lot of opinions and a lot of bickering, Cinastovicus finally raised his hand, silencing everyone immediately."
calisia.97.a: "Gentlemen...let’s count the votes."

calisia.98.t: "Fast and Furious"
calisia.98.desc: "It was the middle of the night at the intersection of Via Legionis and Via Industrialis. Caletus had been waiting two weeks for this moment. Finally, today, he managed to catch the vandal tearing down his election posters. Excited, he jumped out of the bushes where he had been vigilantly watching the horizon and rushed towards the spiteful criminal.\n- Salve, motherfucker! Stop in the name of the Senate! I’m performing a senatorial intervention, you’ll spend the rest of your life in the arena...\n\nSenator Caletus never held his tongue. But it stuck in his throat when he saw that the person destroying his posters was a member of the Praetorian Guard. Shock quickly gave way to another wave of anger when the guard didn’t even react to the politician’s arrival.\n- Hey, dickus minoris! I’m talking to you!\n\nIt was probably not a wise move to resort to physical violence against a battle-hardened praetorian, but Caletus was not one to think before acting. He grabbed the guard’s cloak and tried to pin him against the wall. The guard, with grace, broke free from the senator’s grip and, with two swift moves, brought him to the ground.\n- Listen to me once and for all because I won’t repeat myself. You are nothing. Your entire faction is useless. You are parasites. Do you think you’ll win the election? What fucking election? What game are you playing? Do you really think everything will go back to the way it was? You are our whores, so get it through your thick skull and don’t mess around or we’ll cut off your empty head. Understand?\n\n- Y-yes, of course - Caletus was nearly brought to tears, or at least played the victim well. The praetorian released him and walked to a nearby parked chariot. This didn’t stop the senator, who quickly got up and rushed towards the vehicle, which had already started moving.\n- PRAETORIANS ARE OBSOLETE, NO EMPEROR, NO PRAETORIANS - he began shouting at the top of his lungs. Someone from a nearby block yelled, "Shut your mouth," but the senator was already in his standard fury.\n- YOU WHOREMASTERS, BASTARDS OF HADES, SOMEONE HAS TO FINALLY PUT YOU IN YOUR PLA...\n\nCaletus couldn’t finish his sentence, as the chariot driven by the praetorian sped past him and deftly knocked him unconscious with a swift sideswipe. Apart from a broken arm, Caletus didn’t suffer any serious injuries. But the worst was his wounded pride. Instead of this situation silencing the leader of the Optimates, the next day he recorded a video for all the media, claiming an assassination attempt on his life by the Praetorians. The prefect, however, was pleased with the turn of events. After all, Caletus had exposed himself to attack, using vulgar words to describe the entire Praetorian Guard and their leaders, insulting them up to three generations back. That was all they needed to start a massive purge within the ranks of the Senate’s last faction."

calisia.99.t: "First Fucking Hit"
calisia.99.desc: "- We're gonna fucking smash 'em so hard they won't know what hit 'em. First fucking hit, and they're just dead.\nThe great strategists of the ancient world would surely envy the strategic skill of the Praetorian prefect, who, with simple yet fervent passion and concern for his charges, laid out tactics for the upcoming clash with the rebellious urban cohort near Gedanium. The Praetorians may have had skill in hand and foot, but the chosen skill of logical and critical thinking was not among them; it was this lack that guaranteed them a place in the guard. So they stood and tried to acknowledge the words that were uttered.\n- Alright, listen up! In close combat, we're using our gladii. When you charge, throw your pilum at the first sucker you see, or charge with it right into the enemy and fuck 'em up. Then you bash 'em with your shield and beat 'em down. Keep your eyes peeled, if someone falls, help 'em out, fuck’em up also. Then you swing with the gladius, one, two, three. And then he’s fuuucking dead! If he’s not just kick him until he sees Pluto's gate!\n\nIt wasn't certain if any word reached the purple-clad grunts, and the prefect was pretty aware of this, so he moved on to demonstration, positioning one of the Praetorians opposite him and began showing through example:\n- See, it's all about the entrance. Head down, shield up, spear out, and then you charge, BAM. - the passion with which the prefect presented the charge caused him to skewer the poor Praetorian who served as a training dummy.\n\n- What did I tell you? It works! Take care of him. What do you mean he’s dead? Oh, shit. Okay, Paulus - you’re going to be in the hastati now! Alright, let's split into two groups and warm up. And remember, in battle, it's all about that first fucking hit! Then it's smooth sailing.\n\nFortunately, the training before the actual battle was completed without further loss of life. Reaching the city gates also proved uneventful, but trouble began when both sides couldn't find each other in the maze of blocks in Gedanium even though they both gentlemanly agreed to do battle in one place. Ultimately, it turned out that the entire urban cohort had simply gone for lunch at Burgerrex, while the Praetorians circled around the city center. However, the meat-stuffed city guards made easy targets for the fanatic guardsmen. When both sides amassed their forces facing each other in the city center, there was half an hour of shouting, screaming, and insults. When they finally charged, the Praetorians broke the ranks of the urban cohorts in a matter of minutes and won the fight very easily. And all thanks to the first "fucking" hit."

calisia.100.t: "Pasta is a Lie"
calisia.100.desc: ""Blood. Entrails. Earth littered with bodies. I still remember that one terrified young lad. He couldn't have been more than eighteen years, skinny as a stick, but feisty. He was afraid. So afraid... I tore his throat with my teeth to make him stop screaming. I had to. I really had to! They said if I defeated them all, I'd see my family. They held them hostage and ordered us to keep fighting. Another arena, another massacre. And they just watched as we slaughtered our own kin."\nDietrich sat in the middle of an old barracks that resembled more cages from labor camps than barracks. He pondered the last fight in the arena. He wasn't alone; there were five other barbarians with him. Four Germans, one Scythian. It didn't matter anymore what they were called. They had been dehumanized enough. They sat in dead silence, their eyes wandering the walls while simultaneously penetrating into another world. Those who still had any illusions thought about their loved ones. Others, whose gladiatorial experiences hadn't somehow broken them yet, tried to push out of their minds the screams and the omnipresent death they had experienced. They didn't communicate with each other. They didn't have the right words to utter any sentence. Hope had been taken from them by the crowds cheering at the sight of torn bodies and decapitations.\n\nAt one point, three armed soldiers entered the barracks.\n- Salve, barbarians. You put on quite a show! The plebs loved you; you're their favorites. You're lucky; that was your last fight in the arena - said the praetorian officer. None of the gladiators lifted their heads, except the Scythian, who suddenly began to tremble. - From now on, you'll be soldiers of the Empire! That's right, here I have recruitment papers that enlist you into the first cohort of the Third Legion of Foederatii. You'll get privileges, and your families will be able to stay in the Empire as servants to the patricians in Calisia. Chin up! You've won the greatest prize you could imagine in your situation!\n- W-what privilege we get? - asked Dietrich in broken Latin, finally looking the praetorian straight in the eyes.\n- What privilege? The privilege of life, Germānus. Oh, and you'll have spaghetti for lunch today. Consider that...a welcome gift.\nThe Praetorians began to laugh as if someone had said the funniest thing in the world or another joke about a man dressed as a woman. When they left, still no one was able to speak up or even move. Are they supposed to fight for those people who have stripped them of their humanity? Do they think a bowl of warm pasta will solve years of humiliation?\n\n- PASTA IS A LIE!!! - shouted the Scythian, now unable to control his trembling. He stood up, took off his belt from his pants, and went with it to the room that was supposed to mimic a toilet. Everybody knew what he was up to. No one tried to save him, to reason with him. When they thought Calisia had taken everything from them, the Empire striked back and took even more. Someone will have to clean up the Scythian's body before it starts to stink more than it already does."

calisia.101.desc: "No, this is unbelievable. No, it can't be. Eight years as an auxilarius, four years on the limes, then five full years in the Praetorian cohort, service as an evocati in the guard, a total of twenty years of experience, and here they pay me like I've been punched in the face. How on earth did Flavius get a bigger sack than me?\n- Fucking hell, Juno’s cunt!\n\nThe courtyard of the imperial treasury in Calisia was a scene of eager anticipation and bustling activity. It was payday for the Praetorian Guard, and the air was thick with excitement as they arrived to collect their newly assigned “enhanced” paychecks. They arrived in a variety of modes—some in ornate chariots, others in sturdy carts, and a few even in what could be described as ancient trucks, essentially large wagons fitted with extra horses. Each Praetorian brought along slaves to help carry their soon-to-be-acquired wealth. But for Sebastianus, what he received wasn't enough. He couldn’t carry his sack by himself, but he still envied his colleague for having a tiny bit larger paycheck. It wasn’t by accident that he managed to trip Flavius so he fell sprawling his well-earned money all over the room.\n\nSeeing the flying denarii, everyone just lost their minds as the courtyard erupted into chaos. Flavius grabbed Sebastianus by the tunic, and the two soldiers began to wrestle. Their slaves, seeing their masters embroiled in a brawl, took up the fight on their behalf on the square in front of the building. One slave, a hulking brute, tackled another, sending them both sprawling into a cart of hay. The cart tipped over, sending hay and more coins flying into the air. Domino effect followed, more slaves joined the fray trying to seize as many denarii as they could, alongside the praetorians who apparently left their dignity in the barracks.\n\n- STOP THIS MADNESS AT ONCE - bellowed the centurion who entered the building, his voice cutting through the din. - YOU ARE SOLDIERS OF THE PRAETORIAN GUARD AND YOU WILL ACT LIKE THEM. PICK UP THIS SHIT OR I’LL HAVE YOU FLOGGED! DIIISMIIIISED!\n\nThere wasn’t any talking with the centurion. An order is an order, and while the money gets praetorians acting like apes in the zoo, a proper order from their fellow officer makes them docile sheeps obeying every word. The courtyard slowly returned to order, the only signs of the chaos a few stray coins glinting in the sunlight. As the last of the Praetorians departed, Centurion sighed, shaking his head.\n\n- Payday...- he muttered to himself"

calisia.102.desc: "- MARTINUS THE TESTOSTERONUS NAIMANUS PRIMUS! - the announcer's voice echoed through every corner of the spacious Arena Calisia, where the greatest of all fight spectacles in modern history was taking place. It was here, amidst the most distinguished gladiators from across the country, that the moment would come for the new emperor to enter the pantheon of Calisian rulers. And he emerged. Clad entirely in purple, wielding a gladius in one hand and greeting the crowds with the other. Many of those who had come knew of the wannabe Emperor's previous exploits. But it didn’t matter anymore...\n\n- Greetings, citizens of Calisia! The emperor of freakfights welcomes you to his humble abode! Today, on this ground, a special battle for another imperial title will take place... - Martinus didn't finish his speech as the announcer interrupted him, wanting to introduce his opponent.\n- AND THE OPPONENT OF OUR EMPEROR WILL BE...\n- HOW DARE YOU INTERRUPT THE EMPEROR, YOU FAT FUCK? - Naimanus couldn't stand this and quickly knocked the announcer to the ground with a punch to the head. He picked up the microphone and continued.\n- Today, the battle for the empire will take place! That's right, ladies and gentlemen. Whoever wins tonight's fight will be the emperor. Bring him here to me! Come on, Germanic monkey! Come taste my blade!\n\nAt that moment, his opponent emerged from the wings. A powerful, tall man clad in skins and fur, wielding a two-handed axe that seemed to barely hold despite his immense stature. Without waiting for any judges, without any signal - Naimanus, with a cry of "AVE ME," charged at the disoriented barbarian. The audience endured three rounds of absolute disgrace where both sides, with the grace of a drunken kung-fu master, tried unsuccessfully to strike each other with any weapon. Ultimately, in the thirteenth second of the fourth round, the mighty Germanic stumbled over his own feet while attempting to strike at Naimanus. With the posture and movement of a fat swan, Naimanus dove onto the barbarian and actually managed to pierce his throat with his sword. Covered in blood, he rose triumphantly and began to goad the crowd into chanting his name.\n- YEEEEES, YEEEEES! AVE CAESAR MARTINUS NAIMANUS! WITNESS ME! YOUR EMPEROR!\n\nUnbeknownst to the cheering masses, and perhaps to the Martinus himself, the entire spectacle had been orchestrated by Praetorians. The barbarian was little more than a hapless victim, a Germanic warrior caught in the crossfire of political intrigue. Drugged and disoriented, he had stumbled into the arena unaware of the role he would play in the grand scheme of things.\n\nBut for Martinus, it wouldn’t have even mattered. As the cheers of the crowd washed over him like a wave, he basked in the glow of his newfound glory. For a brief moment, he felt like a true Emperor, the ruler of all he surveyed. And as he gazed out at the adoring throngs, Martinus knew that this was only the beginning of his reign..."

Vinicius stood at the entrance of a repurposed catacomb. It used to house the dead, now it housed a bowl on an altar. Six braziers shined upon it, surrounding it in a circle of light. The stonework of the walls was inscribed in pre-Calisian devotionals, carved skulls and what appeared to be tombstones. All the better.\n\nVinicius stepped ahead, his sandals letting him feel the cold granite beneath. Cold and hard. As they should be. As Vinicius should be, as befits his place as the master of the Legions. An unrelenting, unstoppable force, that brought back an ancient era against all odds and all predictions. That which used to be Poland, was said to have fallen far. The Legions are a proof it’s merely fulfilling its destiny.\n\nAn old man spreads incense and petals over the altar, his ancient chants pagan-inspired. Were they genuine prayers to Mars and Jupiter? Not the point. The point flew in Vinicius’ veins.\n\nHe approaches the altar. A rusty, but serviceable steel bowl. Candles around for even more light. The old priest in his purple toga recognizes the general: Handing him a dagger. He takes the dagger and rolls up the sleeve of his uniform, carefully piercing the skin of his vein. As he does so, he repeats after the priest:\n\n\nI swear\n\nThat from now on until the end of time\n\nI will be the enemy of Praetorian Guard\n\nThe blood dripped unto the bowl\n\nAnd the Calisian Senate.\n\nIt started streaming in tiny strand, pooling up at the bowl. The priest spread more petals.\n\nThe tyrant. Caletvs.\n\nHe shook his arm and more blood flew in drops.\n\nThe serpent. Kinastowski!\n\nAnd now the most important part.

Though it has seen better days, as has Calisia, the mood was still full of naive hope for some. People walked and talked, others sat and listened as few loudmouths would pontiff on politics. An occasional senator would walk by and answer questions in a collegial way. All was well. For now.\nSENATORS!!! ARE YOU LISTENING?!\nA small mob gathered around the group of senators. Gray dresses, tracksuits, if these were dignified citizens, they sold their best clothes already. A sign of things to come. Senators faced off worried and confused mouths and replied to the best of their rhetorics:\n\nCalisia fell apart. Let’s take it back! \nBut how?\nSenate, build us a better city, a city for everyone!\nEveryone?! Barbarian sympathizer, to the stocks with you!\n\nAs days passed, the conversation increased in desperate fervor and urgency. Fewer and fewer senators went down to the Forum, their noble togas replaced by riot gear and Vigiles wearing it.\n\n-Senators... ever since the Triumvirate, we lack so many things...\n-People are starving! Less food, more mouths to feed!\n\nThat was the breaking point. The subject of food was a taboo, by the Senate’s will. No one wanted the realities of food security to hit the city and erupt it into food riots. It would only make things worse, spiral the problem. We had to lie.\n\nWe are treated like barbarians, left to suffocate!\nNobles have all the land, slaves have all the work! What about us?!\nWho can feed our families?\nSENATE?! THIS SQUALOR WILL KILL CALISIA!\n\nSENATE!!! \nSoon enough, camaraderie was over. In the last week, the Forum was empty, save for few well-protected and brave merchants. And the mobs. Vulgus in crowds running around, looking for anything to steal, anyone to blame. One senator passing by had to face them off with his mighty retinue:\n\n\nWHERE ARE THE HOMES YOU PROMISED?\nEQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK!\nSTOP THE HOSPITAL TRIAGE!\nCALISIA FOR CALISIANS!\nYOU BURIED CALISIA WHEN YOU BURIED IMPERATOR RICARDUS! NOW YOU PAY!!!\n\nThe molotov flew right at the Senator, only to be caught by a riot shield. And then the carnage began.

calisia.110.desc: "The child-like, yet ever observant eyes. Grin so wide it wasn’t even funny anymore. Agent Jaś was on the roll today. He would pierce right through the watchful eye of the Legionary guards and infiltrate their camp…\n…while dressed as a bush. He sat at the relatively arid road in his bush disguise. The area was hilly and treeless, almost like a meadow degenerating into savanna. The base was half a kilometer away, behind a perimeter of a fence gate and barbed wire. The legionary would spend a minute standing guard his way. Then he’d change positions: This is when Jaś was on the move, rustling, crouched, moving. As soon as the guard would look his way, he’d drop down. The deranged game of red light-green light saw the yokel of a guard ponder whether bushes on the road were changing places, whilst the village loon acting as a spy crept up ever closer in his haphazard disguise.\n It’s not like Jaś even asked for the job. He was one of the few whose fate improved after the Fall. Before, living as a city’s dorm janitor, he was cast down and dismissed as mentally challenged, differently abled, all that horseshit. Everyone said they feel for him: No one wanted to have anything to do with him. No, he can’t go to a birthday party: they’d just dismiss and make up excuses like he didn’t know what they were doing.  After the fall, having moved back to his village, he has ended up as everything the city acquaintances feared he’d be. A clown. A village idiot. He knew as much. But he also knew the village did one thing that the city folks would never even consider.\n\n Accept him as part of the village. \n\n Praetorians seemed no different when they offered him a job like this. Get paid. Make a friend. Why not? He was just gonna try to get into the military base.\n And he almost did, when suddenly a vehicle drove up from the opening gates. And it stopped. And a centurion stepping out kicked poor Jaś’ disguise off of him. \n\n What happened to poor Jaś didn’t matter anymore. The guard and centurion focused on him, asking pointless questions from his point of view/ Shouting on and on, he seemed not to even hear them.\nExcuse me, what are you doing here?” - he asked on and on in response to their words, whatever they were\nAnd then, finally: \n”O!”\n The men decided to drive Jaś away, closer to his village. Even gave him a bag of milk. As he drank greedily, quite a few drops of milk fell outside a bag of milk, which was soon fully outside a bag of milk. They concluded he was a harmless schizo, far from an uncommon sight in this country.\n The true threat however, lurked as a shadow, and when the two men were busy with Jaś, it crept in and crawled in full arid camo, undetected.\n\n “Codename Vulpes Inculta, report #1:\n The infiltration was a resounding success. Everything went right, almost too right: The Mr Bean maneuver made my insertion seamless.You were right, it appears the village idiot told them nothing and we’re safe from being compromised. The mission can proceed as planned. The evidence will be planted, and i might secure a confidential informant or two if I need to…”"

Latrine duty, food that smells like it came from the aforementioned latrine. Another recruit got sent to disciplinary, apparently said he got lost on his way to Berlinium to his centurion. Guess who had the distinct ‘pleasure’ of administering lashes.\n\nLike the thatch gets dark after laying over the years, so do our tents in my eyes. The monotony of a soldier’s life kills me.

calisia.112.desc: " - Enemies at the 4th! - centurion Pretium ordered.\n - For Vinicius! For Calisius! - men responded by shooting at the positions of the soldiers loyal to the Praetorians.\nThey could count on the VPM Mantichoras supporting them. Until it was destroyed by their enemy's anti-tank launcher. Nevertheless, after a brief fire exchange, soldiers loyal to the Legate of the South Legio XIX drove their enemies away to further defensive positions. Among them was legionary Ioannis Saponis. He was a less-than-stellar shooter, but not much could be expected from someone who quickly picked up the streets to fill the gaps in the front. After all, Vinicius needed as many men as possible to triumph against two other Triumvirs. Even despite his reported strategic prowess.\nAs soon as Ioannis approached the former positions of the enemy in the trenches, he began checking the corpses of Cinsatovicus's soldiers. He was looking for the body of his cousin, Constantius, who fought on the opposing side. As fate would have it, he was assigned to Constantia's garrison, while Ioannis stayed with his family in Cracovia. When the Calisia fell apart no Triumvir cared for the bounds of blood. Their ambition was all that mattered. What else? Vinicius claimed he warred for honor and revenge for the Emperor. This didn't add up with the fact he had legalized it as tyrannicide with his signature.\nThankfully, none of the dead soldiers bore the face of Constantius. One corpse's head was mutilated beyond recognition. Ioannis felt nauseous, but he had to check.\nThe dog tag wasn't his cousin's. Now Ioannis knew Constantius wasn't killed, at least not by his hand.\n- Bene, enough graverobbing. Show those let's shoot the bastards! - one of his squadmates shouted.\nHaving secured a relatively safe position in the captured trench, he fired a few potshots, before pretending his gun jammed. He wasn't ready to give up on his peace of mind just yet. Soon, the prefect's men retreated beyond the sight of Vinicius's men.\n - You there! - decanus Manes looked at Ioannis - why weren't you shooting?.\n - Err, my gun got jammed. - Someone must've told on him. No matter, he smeared the old Corvus rifle, so it would be jammed for real. At least that's what he hoped for.\nFortunately for him, he was right.\n\nSaponis knew he couldn't fight like that. Not while he was worried sick about his family member on the other side of the front. He didn't want to desert Vinicius's army during the transportation to the front, as then he'd have to rely on robbery to survive. But now that he was so close to the front, he really considered the prospect of defecting to the other side. He cared little for each Triumvir's cause, but no one asked his opinion and if he had to fight for someone, might as well fight for the side his cousin was on."

While he had all the power to sit on the throne in Constantia, he wanted to postpone courtly life as long as he could. Also, he wanted to deny his incoming guest the honor of being judged in such a dignified place as a palace. The one he awaited for arrived quicker than expected.\n - We found him, sir. He tried to escape the realm by the sea! - Vinicius soldiers brought the prisoner before their Legate./n - You should've known snakes aren't able to swim.\n - As a matter of fact they are - his joke was stopped by Legate's punch - I thought you'd focus more on Caletus, given how you were at each others' throats.\n - It was just a pose. I'm an actor you know. And he was really pissing me off. - Vinicius approached the map - Not to mention Constantia was so much closer to the front than Calisia./n - Why are you doing this? - Cinastovicus tried to find a comfortable position for his tied arms. - Are you that power-hungry?\n - It's not about power. I'm dispensing justice - he pointed spatha towards former praefect's throat - against those who killed the greatest man in post-war Poland. A man, who ended the chaos of the Fall, who had a vision for the future.\n - Who finally made second-class actor relevant again. - another strike now with a pommel landed on Cinastovicus's face - You won't bring him back. This escapade will end only with more death and unnecessary death of praetorians and Optimates and then there won't be anybody to govern what's left of Calisius's dream. Is that how you protect his legacy? Is that the price for your sense of justice?\n - If you think you can save yourself, you must know, you're only making me angrier. Soldiers, gag him! - Legionaries put a rag in praetorian's mouth.\nKilling a father of a nation is as bad as any other patricide, if not worse. - Vinicius now monologue uninterrupted - Romans of old had a suitable penalty for such crimes. I'm talking about Poena Cullei. When we get back to Constantia, you will be put in a sack with a few animals and thrown into Vistula. Then the people will show your corpse some appreciation. - As Vinicius was talking Christianus's face was getting paler and paler - take him out, men.\nAfter they left Vinicius, smirking, was looking at the strategic map on the table awaiting confrontation with Caletus."

If his men had only captured Vinicius, then he wouldn't need so many executees, but alas his hand was forced. The 'honorable' Legate committed suicide piercing himself with his gladius. As it would turn out Caletus would be denied not only Vinicius's body but also his lands, irking the Consul even further.\n\nAfter some time the second cause of Caletus headache arrived.\nCinastovicus wore the finest velvet he could find. If it wasn't for the fact Caletus sat on the throne, you couldn't say who's supposed to be a Consul.\n- It appears your men didn't apprehend Vinicius on time - Cinastovicus said cautiously with a strain of smugness.\n - It appears your men have managed to take over his lands, however. - Caletus went straight to the point - Despite my war effort being superior to yours.\n- It was beyond my control - praefectus shrugged his arms as a sign of helplessness - Either local governors declared us as the rulers or the local legions surrendered to us. When it comes to land, don't think I'm not aware of the march of your legions on my territory in the north.\n - Don't toy with me, slimeball! You live nothing up to coincidence or chance. - Caletus for the time being ignored his accusations.\n - This whole situation happened by chance. - Cinastovicus defended himself - A spiral of events out of my control. \n - Enough - Caletus interrupted him once again - The current division of land upsets the balance.\n - Why, all of the lands have been acquired as we've agreed...\n - I want you to admit to my rule over the rest of Pomerania and Vartia. - Caletus smiled mockingly - I'm glad you mentioned it.\n - You have no right! - praetorian finally lost his temper - I won't allow this!\n - You will - Consul stood up - unless you want another war. I'm being reasonable here. Just halves of two provinces.\nCaletus approached Cinastovicus trying to intimidate him.\n- All right. - Christianus gave up.\n - Great. You still got the better parts, you know. I trust you'll see yourself out.\n After Cinastovicus left, Caletus sat on the throne still not content, not content at all at another partial victory."

However, the room where the meeting was to take place was not exactly a gem of architecture and interior design. The head of the delegation from the Senate, Thaddaeus Scarginscis, was sure that this room had previously been used for slaves. This did not bode well for the hospitality of their potential allies, but they had to grit their teeth and put on a brave face, as Consul Caletus had instructed. On the other hand, it was the Praetorians who had extended the invitation for the talks...\nThaddaeus, along with his chief negotiator, Senator Catharina Gaius, and the scribe Camillus, whose surname no one ever remembered, sat waiting for someone with whom they could discuss matters. After fifteen minutes, a young Praetorian entered the room, whom the senators did not recognize. He smiled from ear to ear and promptly apologized for the delay.\n- Excellencies, forgive the chaos. Can I offer you something to drink? Coffee? Tea? Perhaps some wine? - officer at least seemed polite. Thaddaeus relaxed a bit but wanted to get to the heart of the matter as soon as possible.\n- Thank you very much. We would simply like to discuss our agenda. When will Prefect Cinastovicus arrive? - asked Scarginscis. The officer’s face turned crimson, and his smile quickly gave way to a nervous grimace.\n- He will not be coming. I have been instructed to receive your proposals, and everything will be relayed to the Prefect as soon as he returns to the capital. We did not want to postpone the meeting, you know.\n- Very well, then listen to this - Catharina suddenly spoke up. - First of all, there can be no talk of a return to monarchy.\n\nShe paused, keenly observing the officer's reaction. She struck with a hard demand first, but he just continued to stare directly at her, smiling again and nodding. This slightly unsettled the senator, but she continued nonetheless.\n- To achieve this, we need to start reinstating pre-collapse solutions. A second chamber of parliament, independent media, seats in companies for senators, judicial reform, tax reform...\nPraetorian kept nodding, listening intently. Thaddaeus wondered how far they could push this, so he added his own insertions:\n- Sanctioned opposition, a tribunal for the Populares and the barbarians, economic reform?\n- Of course! - replied the officer.\n- Do you want to...write this down? - Thaddaeus asked.\n- I'll remember, thank you!\n- Camillus, perhaps you could provide the gentleman with a copy of our proposals. Make sure to pass this on to the Prefect. We will await a response, and now excuse us, we take our leave\n\nAnd with that, the delegation handed over their demands and left the imperial palace, uncertain but hopeful that their proposals would be seriously considered. Whole discussion was short, rather insulting, and the Optimates made themselves leave the room when all of their demands seemed to be acknowledged and agreed upon. But...they weren’t really negotiating."

Or more like, they were carried by buses and paid to participate in this event.\nAmidst the crowd, vendors sold various items emblazoned with the Optimates logo, from tunics to trinkets, while others handed out pamphlets denouncing the Populares and the warnings about a barbarian threat.\n- ALL OF CALISIA SINGS WITH US, TURN BARBARIANS INTO DUST\nIf you could ask a random attendee why they’re here, you would only get some political slogans in response. Or you would be called a germanic traitor or popularist traitor, or even scythian traitor! Either way, you would always be a traitor.\n- RES PUBLICA! RES PUBLICA!\nYou couldn’t tell also if they were really chanting for the restoration of a democratic state, or was it just a tribal call for their favorite television network. Some things have really changed only a little.\n- CONSTITUTION! LAW! JUSTICE!\nDecades of latinization couldn’t root out from society this giant mental stain that was imprinted upon them by Pre-Fall governments. In the end, Roman ideals couldn’t defeat the legacy of a good change. Its politicians went underground, many of them joined optimates, and by rebranding they persevered.\n- DEUS! HONOR! PATRIA!\nAt some point, the crowd's anger reached a fever pitch. Many were shaking their fists, and a few had even brought effigies of barbarian leaders and Populares senators, which they now set alight. Vigiles didn’t even intervene when they decapitated puppets of Calisius and Tusc. Maybe they couldn’t. Maybe they simply didn’t care anymore.\n- FIGHT THE POWER!\nNobody knows why the riots started. Some say it was because of a provocation. Some explain that the people had the right to relieve their anger that was bottled inside them for years of populares oppression. And of course the most popular excuse for vandalism - they were happy. Why? Because Calisia is now back to being a republic, of course."

But he couldn't.\nIn the distance he could notice a sniper, certainly waiting for him to take him down, had he said something 'traitorous'. And there were surely some undercover frumentarii operatives to justify his death. He had to be subtle and subtlety was not Marcus Vinicius's way. But he didn't need to speak as Marcus Vinicius.

Here, under leave of Caletus and the rest - For Caletus is an honourable man; So are they all, all honourable men - Come I to speak in Calisius's funeral.\n\nHe was my friend, faithful and just to me. But Caletus says he was ambitious; And Caletus is an honourable man. He hath brought many captives home to Calisia. Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Calisius seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Calisius hath wept. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Caletus says he was ambitious; And Caletus is an honourable man.\n\nI speak not to disprove what Caletus spoke, but here I am to speak what I do know.\n\nYou all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him? O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their reason.

We will hear Calisius's will. - the whole crowd roared.\n\n- Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it; It is not meet you know how Calisius loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men; And, being men, bearing the will of Calisius, it will inflame you, it will make you mad. 'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs; For, if you should, O, what would come of it!/nThe crowd had already been driven to the verge of madness caused by grief.

It's hard to believe they were Cinastovicus's men./n The leader of the praetorians usually prefers staging careful plots, that were too complicated for Caletus's taste. After all, why bother with all that planning, when a few slashes across the torso do the job just fine.\nHe took another sip. He's completed most of his plans, so he could allow himself some indulgence for his achievements. After all thanks to him tyranny was over, the Calisian population was safe from the barbarian invasion, and peace was secured. More or less. He still had to deal with Vinicius and Cinastovicus, but how hard could it be? Sure, he needs them to govern the realm, but they need him even more. Vinicius is popular and Cinastovicus has a lot of power, but Caletus is the only full-blooded politician among them.

He will most likely be apprehended by the Praetorians. Imprisoned for uttering the thoughts he only dared to think. After his speech over Calisius's body, he planned to escape the city with the help of his legions and a popular uprising. However, he soon realized the Praetorians and Optimates created a cordon separating the capital from the rest of Calisia. Trying to break out or in, would result in Vinicius's death. The thought of postponing his revenge made him grit his teeth. Unable to think clearly among the rackety crowd and with his head filled with hatred, he tried to embrace the moment. He smiled, waved, gave some woman a wink, the usual.\n He felt he wasn't ready to face Cinastovicus and Caletus in the Imperial Palace. He ordered his retinue to head to his residence.\n\nOnce he was there, he started to weigh his options. His first instinct was to enter the palace and slit traitors throats, kill as many of their guards as possible before being slain himself and let the sensible men fix the mess he had caused. But there were no sensible men left. Calisius, Compa, Hvedorcus are all dead. Somehow, he - the least ideologically driven of them became the last light of Populares's cause. Not because of his own conviction, but because it's what Calisius, the man, who made him what he is today would've wanted. He'll do the right thing, even if he doesn't know how.\nUnsure of the future, he decided to head to the palace and see how things play out. To his advantage, the 'Liberatores' probably thought him to be a shameless hedonist with no higher values of his own. For his own benefit, he will play the role they provided for him.

Add to that the fact that Christianus after the disgraceful coup of Calisius in 2025 retreated from politics. His reassignment had only ended recently. \nStill, the opinion of the riff-raffs wasn't the thing that occupied Consuls's mind. It was the mistakes of his men, that forced him into this less than ideal position. The men responsible were already dealt with, but now instead of planning to seize all power for himself, he had to smile and wave to the crowd that treated him like some parade platform. All that to reach the negotiation that would probably result in some type of collective rule.\n - I worry too much - Cinastovicus could feel the drops of sweat slowly gathering on his forehead - I undermined the position of the father of the nation and even was responsible for his death. Yet still he was here. Alive. Even despite that lengthy speech of Vinicius over the Emperor's body. He survived that. Even thrived. He could wait some more time to achieve his ultimate goal - complete control over Calisia. The fate he deserved before Calisius ousted him from his office. What stood against him?

That is why all we do must be deemed lawful and that is why, Marcus Vinicius, we need your sign under this act.\nCinastovicus moved a piece of paper towards the Legate and continued.\n - It's an act of accusation against Ricardus Calisius. It accuses him of tyranny and if the courts accede to our opinion, and they will, the murder of the emperor and mass annulment of Populares' laws will become lawful and justified acts of preserving the republic. While an accusation from Caletus and I especially would be contested. We need the support of someone credible. Someone whose testimony would give our claim a much-needed legitimacy, no matter the ruling of the despised courts.\n- Yeah, we need you to sign it - Caletus summed prefect's lecture.\nMarcus had to think for a while. He was ready to play their little game, but no one would know about it. Will he have any honor left after he complies?\n- What would I get in return?\n- Nah-uh, it doesn't work like that - Caletus stopped his questions.\n- First you sign it - Cinastivicus agreed with him - It's not like you have a choice in the matter."

It's due to its size and the factional conflicts... Calisia cannot be ruled by a single person, but it can be managed by three gentlemen! A triumvirate, if you will. You wanted payment, Vinicius? How about your own piece of the Empire?\nLegate wasn't expecting that turn of events.\n- How do we know, he won't attack us once we give him power? - Caletus asked, agitated that Cinastivicus became the master of the ceremony. - He's already threatened a Consul of Calisia!\n- Easy there - Vinicius said in a very lax tone. Then he grabbed a glass of wine from butler's plate, before the servant was able to put it on table - If I wanted power, I'd have taken it long ago in 2026, before any of you became prominent players. - he took a sip of wine - I'm just an old legionary, just give enough land for my men to cultivate, with high enough revenue, so I can drink, and feast, and whore my way into the grave. Then, I'll be your loyal soldier boy.\n- Even, if he won't - prefefctus went on with the arguments for his proposal - the combined power of the other two Triumvirs will stop the one, who went rogue.\n- If that's the case - Vinicius unsheathe his sword, Caletus reached to grab his expecting an attack.\nVinicius however turned his back to him and approached a wall with a map hanging on it. The Legate began carving it. - I'll take this.\nHe showed the other men a piece that roughly included the teritories of Galicia, Scythia, Vartia and Silesia Superior.\n- The wealthiest, most fetrile and those more or less untouche by the Barbarians?

If i want cooked guineafowl for dinner, they’ll get me one. If I want the best wine in all Europe, there you go! If I want to go out for a walk, suddenly I can only wander through my gardens and menagerie.\n- Doesn’t sound that bad...- responded dr Hastius, confused as to what he could even say in this case. It’s like there is a party in someone’s house, and you really need to go, but your companion stays on talking, and talking, and talking. It gets awkward. That's what the doctor was feeling right now. And it was getting more intense by each passing minute.\n\n- Bad...Was I? A bad father? A bad ruler? I always tried my best. Maybe I was too harsh. Or sometimes too lenient. Or...ignorant? They’ve reduced me to a shell of a man. Back in the pre-Fall days...gods, I was strong back then! I could eat a whole pig by myself. Now I can barely taste anything. It’s like everything lost its flavour. There are only black and white colours, and I'm unable to do anything about it! Maybe they are right...maybe my time has come and I should just vanish into the dust of history. But I wanted to do so many things before the end! Eh...let’s face it - everything I have ever done was in some or other way wrong and bad. Even if I had good intentions. Especially then. No one really appreciated me being in charge, and I gather...i haven’t either. Is there any hope for me yet, doctor?"

calisia.135.desc: "Plates clinked gently, their rhythmic noise matching the gallant composure of the guests as they slowly made their way through their dinner. Fine bison meat, the closest they could get to feasting on an actual auroch, paired excellently with red Latium. As the two parties sized each other up in silence, looking for any potential weaknesses, they continued their ritualistic dance of perfectly coordinated movements, any failure to follow the hundreds of hidden norms and conventions enough to ruin the standing of the offending individual. Petrus Caletus was the first to break: \n- You know, it’s a real shame what happened to your father, Antonius. - He spoke while chewing, upsetting the Prince's sense of order. - I never really took him for much of a traitor. \n- Yes, a shame. - Antonius replied in a courtly, calculated tone. - But we can't have barbarians infiltrating the Empire. It was harsh, for sure, but necessary. \n- Gah! At least somebody in that fancy palace gets it! - the Senator wiped his spit with a handkerchief, betraying any pretenses of class - If only your brother was this agreeable! \n- You're right, Consul. If only... - he gave his interlocutor a sly smirk - Sadly, his faults make him incapable of taking the throne, don't you think? It's terrifying just how much damage he could do... unless somebody stops him, that is. \n- Are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting? - Petrus Caletus could barely contain his excitement, speaking with his mouth still full while directing threatening gestures at the absent Princeps. \n- A bit more discretion, could you, Consul? Good. Now, I have the slightest suspicion you didn't just invite me over for a friendly conversation. Let me guess, my father has been getting quite... vocal about his disapproval of the current power balance. Perhaps you even prepared a list of generous offers to potentially make me cooperate. Well, I have a better deal for you, Senator. Ricardus is irredeemable, you see. So is Ignatius. But, of course, the Optimates do not have to accept a monarch that is harmful to the Empire. If they were to put their weight behind a candidate more aligned with their interests, Calisia could really start to bloom. \n- Hmm, but who could we possibly put forward? - He asked sheepishly. - There's nobody with a legitimate claim... \n- Me, you stu... - the Prince barely restrained himself. - You know what, I'll handle the talking. Just promise me I'll have your faction's full support once the Emperor is out of the way."

calisia.136.t: "The Lynx’s Cull"
calisia.136.desc: "Fourteen minutes. A new record. Despite all the forced decorum present in the Senate, that is all the time it took for the chamber to devolve into a back-and-forth flurry of insults. While most ideological differences could be overlooked, the barbarian crisis caused both factions to cross the point of no return, something the Optimates were keen to repeatedly let their rivals know. \n\n- Traitors, all of you! Sold us out, sold us all out! Clearly, this Empire means nothing to you because you keep sullying it with barbarian filth! We’ve been infiltrated, our noble blood diluted by these mutts. And you, Senator Compa, you are nothing but a Germanic agent, a worthless tool of their apocalyptic tide. When Calisia burns, and the last remnants of order are gone, I hope they find their way into your villa so you can watch as they turn your daughter into their own personal whore. \n\nPetrus Caletus was in his element. All those years of restraint may have dulled his combative spirit, but he was glad that, at last, the gloves were off. Every boisterous comment by the dominant Populares, each mocking remark by the Barbares, enflamed a primal rage within him, reducing the framework of a veteran politician to a pool of vitriolic hatred spilling out all over the Senate floor. \n\nYet today, something seemed to be amiss. Rather than levying a single response against his rival, Consul Compa simply sat there, taking in the barrage of ad hominems with almost too much poise, seemingly unfazed by it all. And... what was that smirk? Did he... just reach under the table? \n\n- You barbarian-loving scum, what do you think you're doing, huh? - The barrage from the pulpit continued. - Explain yourself before this chamber! Let every Calisian citizen know that you took their homes, took their dignity, and soon you will replace them with uncivilized halfwits! This will be your end, Consul. I will see to it that you and your accomplices will... \n\nWith a loud thud, the door to the Senate floor swung open. Before the echoing noise subsided, like a wave streaming down to sweep away the Calisian foundation, came the outpour of legionaries, all donning armor far too ceremonial to be of any combat effectiveness, almost as if they were reveling in their role as temporary enforcers of public justice. \n\nMost of the Optimates tried to run, some simply stood in their seats, baffled at the unfolding events. And in the middle of it all, Petrus Caletus continued to huddle the pulpit, his ramblings beginning to sound more and more like desperate pleadings. \n\n- This is a total mockery of law and order! Andrius, I order you to disperse this rabble at once! \n\nSo occupied was the speaker with his demands that he failed to notice the gallant figure slowly approaching his spot. With the overwhelming multitude of medals proudly displayed on his chest, Marcus Vinicius commanded a sense of authority unmatched by even the most decorated of legates. With elegance and decor, effortlessly merging the disparate styles of the court and military, the commander lifted his arm and, with a hint of delayed satisfaction, pushed it straight into the senator’s lower jaw, ending his speech mid-word. Limply, without any fanfare, the last bastion of Calisian oligarchism collapsed onto the ground, only to be dragged away in shame like a disobedient child, kicking and screaming."

calisia.142.t: "Shame Parade"
calisia.142.desc: "In the central arsenal of Calisia, the emptiness was palpable. Praefectus Provisionis Andreas Quercus was far from pleased by this fact. Especially since the grand military parade was to take place the following day on the streets of the Eternal City. Legions from across the country were sending their representative companies. But none of the Legates were generous enough to lend heavier military equipment for the parade. So, the prefect could only hope that the legionnaires would at least bring their personal gear so he wouldn’t have to scavenge for old gladii and scrap resembling lorica segmentata armor.\n\n- Marcus! What if we borrowed some chariots from the racing track? There's no hope for airplanes...but send people throughout the city to look for anyone with drones. If they fly high enough, no one will realize it's Sericum junk. And try to find any tracked vehicles in the city. Anything! - The prefect was frantically searching for any solutions that would allow him to conduct the parade without facing public ridicule. After all, Augustus himself would be there. If it looked more like a medieval peasant march instead of a mighty army, they’d throw him to the lions.\n\n- Sir Prefect Captain! - One of the young legionnaires, who had been assigned to this duty as punishment, suddenly burst into the warehouse holding a scroll of parchment - I have good news!\n- They didn’t teach you to salute in the legion?!\n- P-p-pardon, sir captain magistrate - stammered the legionnaire, making a hesitant hand gesture. Drill and proper titling of superiors were not his strong suits - I have news from Legio Alpha! They’ve just entered the city and are on their way here. They have a tank for us!\n- Ave Vinicius! Finally! Wait, what do you mean, a tank? As in, singular?\n- Do we even have more? They said a tank, not tanks.\n\nAn hour later, it turned out the message was accurate. When the representative company of the first legion headed to the barracks for rest, a single tank with its crew made its way to the arsenal hall. By post-fall standards, it looked quite impressive. As impressive as a tank cobbled together from scrap can look. The legion's banner fluttered on the back of the tank, and the entire structure at least seemed to hold together. However, the closer it got to the prefect, the worse it appeared. The grating sound it made could frighten anyone, but probably most of all the crew. When they parked, Andreas approached the vehicle, somewhat mollified but wary.\n\n- Salve, soldiers. I see you've brought me something sensible at last - he said, slapping the tank’s front plate with satisfaction so hard that a side plate fell off. The tank commander didn’t seem overly concerned, evidently this happened more often than one would admit.\n- Don't worry, sir, this junk does that. It can be fixed - the commander said, trying to demonstrate the process by kicking the tank. The other side plate also fell off, the steel plates on the turret began to slide, and the banner on the back of the tank toppled over. Many thoughts now swirled in Andreas’s mind. Many of them vulgar."

She could not believe it would persevere or mark her a citizen or even last a year. And according to everything she knew anything about, the time all this was coming to a head was... now.\n\n"Well, the market’s in itsy bitsy little gully right now, everyone decided the housing market went crazy, now it’s time to cool down before we pick up steam again. Happens when renovation costs keep rising, right?" - the realtor who introduced himself as Thaddeus went on and on about how good the market is, like trying to talk her out of selling. He pointed out at one mansion on peripheria of Calisia - "This one for example, i think he’s motivated to sell his in exchange."\n\n"Why is he selling?" - she asked\n"He’s not working right now. Weird guy, doesn’t even buy slaves."\n"So they’re leaving, why? Inflation?"\n"That villa over there, I sold for 3 mil. Four months later, four mil."\n"You sure it’s the housing market and not price increase?"\n"Oh it’s just a gully, that’s all, just nerves"\n"How many people are selling then?"\n"This place on the left, it’s mine. I could sell, maybe, but that’s just a summer home."\n"A summer home that looks more like a junkie den..."\n\n"What?" The car stops and Thaddeus walks out, clearly agitated. No one told Julia her realtor held a hand cannon in the suitcase. He walked into the summer house. A few screams, more in common with meese than human beings. Two shots from the hand cannon. Thaddeus must have been a gym rat, as to Julia, the sound was ear shattering even from the car. A few decrepit junkie barbarians ran out through windows, nevermind glass lacerations.\n\n"Fucking barbarians everywhere, like ants! Next time i’m gonna shoot them like ants!" Thaddeus was fuming when he reentered the car, but Julia was shuddering. "Whats wrong?" - he asked\n\n"One of these ‘barbarians’... I knew him from Calisia tavern. He was a bartender just a year ago."

After the Fall, the one thing she had left was her husband and his lands. The early days of Fall were dreary to face for a woman otherwise used to luxury. But within Calisia, over the years, Atia’s husband worked his land, bought slaves to re-utilize more of it, and rebuilt their wealth.\n\nNow Atia could vent off her frustrations on slaves. Feeling down due to Calisian women’s legal status? Whip a least productive slave. Husband’s being a dude and can’t even catch on basic clues like your eyelids lowering half a centimeter while sitting on a different lap than usual? A hunky slave was always obedient and observant. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned - and Atia was already there while on precipice.\n\nThese days, however, it was worse than ever. "He always yaps on how prices go up and we need to spend less. How can he see a financial bubble without female intuition?" - she’d gossip with fellow Calisian housewives, in her dining room, sipping on last reserves of her wine cellar.\n\n"Yeah, the eggs at the market have doubled in price already relative to last month. Some unrest in the capital, but this is pretty much the usual in this cursed land. No one sees a bubble, that’s what makes it a bubble.\n\n"I take it no one can see that Vinicius no longer imports food?"\n\n"Shush, do you know how dangerous is saying that? We should cut down on the wine, we have shortage as it is."\n\nAtia wasn’t even all that concerned. They sold wheat and even eggs, prices rising meant more money for them! But still husband wanted them to save. Yesterday she spent whole day looking for ways to cut the costs. Ultimately she figured out the slaves can go mash meat with hay and eat the resulting kibble. She also cracked open the dog food she had left after her old german shepherd, Titus, passed away. The slaves were beneath Titus anyway.\n\nToday, she argued on and on with her friends about what was even going on around them. Soon, they left. Normally they’d yap on and on till midnight, but they had to leave till dusk, the streets weren’t safe at night. Sometime later, while sitting on the couch and resting, she heard some commotion, pottery breaking, her husband’s furious yelling. In barged the husband, a bald thin man, with bloodied knife.\n\n"What the fuck is going on out there? The slaves just made their escape!"\n\n"WHAT?! Why haven’t the guards.... wait, we dismissed the guards, they were asking too much!"\n\n"Goddamit, you had one job... you didn’t feed the slaves, didn’t you?!"\n\n"I... this is YOUR fault.

All that matters was her husband was a good-for-nothing and there was no way she’d be with him when everything that makes him a man save for his tacklebox, is gone. She has needs and doesn’t need a pauper.\n\nNevermind there’s not a single rich male in this entire cursed province at the moment. The one who came close approached a working girl in Atia’s sight:\n\n“Are you free?”\n“No, I work like a carriage here”\n“I have a hundred thousand right here!” - the vigilus pointed at his briefcase\n“Sorry boy, I'm a million denarii baby and you know it.”\n“Since when?”\n“Since now.”\n\nA million denarii girl. Atia didn’t even have that much, not that it’d buy her much. But that wasn’t the problem. Somehow, between dirt, roaming the dangerous streets like a ghost, someone screaming bloody murder every other minute, the one thing that hurt the most, is that she had less net worth to a prostitute...\n\nPROSTITUTE! SCARCELY ABOVE SLAVE! WHOSE ONLY PLACE WAS GET IT UP IN HER FROM THE CLIENT AND GET IT IN HER FACE FROM HER PIMP! - she screamed to herself, but soon shut up. Some dude yelling at a howling woman. Atia snuck up to the insula where it happened and peeked through the window. A working girl was getting pimpslapped by a man behind the window. Must have been her pimp. He then sent her on her way, adjusted his jewelry, almost caught Atia as he turned around, and followed the working girl.\n\nAtia wasn’t bothered by the girl’s plight: She was in a state of mind where only she counted. And so she carefully opened the broken window and snuck into the office. It was time to rob and steal, to soothe the ego, to survive. Before she could pinch anything, the pimp returned, and she had to hide behind the desk, her most valuable possession in hand: A dagger. When the pimp walked by the desk and spotted her, he shuddered and jumped up.\n\nBefore anything else could even be thought of, Atia jumped on him.\n\nShe fell on the pimp with a pugio to his neck and didn’t hesitate. Sickening sound of steel rending flesh, red fountain in Atia’s face. She did not mind. Adrenaline guided her. Ripping the gold chains and taking the rings: Wait, that gold is fake as fuck. Nevermind... his drawers. Papers. More papers. Condoms? Eek. And, jackpot. Diamonds, jewelry of actual gold and silver, she could almost smell the authentic precious metals. And best of all, the real, honest-to-god... stacks of Ukrainian hryvnas? He must have been buying or selling girls from Scythian underworld. Atia took everything of real value, escaped through the window before she thought Vigiles would get there (they wouldn’t for the next six hours) and ran. For the first time today, she was proud of herself. And deathly afraid. After all, she was now the richest person in the entire city. Next order of business: Escape this hellhole."

The hatred was directed externally, towards the barbarian and a raider that Calisia was set to bring the hammer down on. Each corner of the forum held a speaker, each of them with a crowd of citizens listening, each channeling and focusing hatred into a concentrated stream of rhetoric, right towards their listeners. One of them on the southeast corner had just begun:\n\n\"Having rejected common humanity, the barbarians among us stop at nothing to defile us! Do not presume they are out for themselves merely, no: They are out for malice, their driver is pure fucking meanness! How many girls were trafficked by Scythians! How many were raped by Visigoths and looted by Saxons? To show the evils of our enemies, we present to you this book, the Dangerous Connections of Barbarians!\"\n\n\"My wife is Scythian, you cheap demagogue fuck!\" - one man at the front of the crowd interjected, the rest looking at him like he had just stripped down naked.\n\n\"Your wife is your responsibility, I didn’t even give mine my surname! But it’s a wild land out there: And wilderness breeds barbarism. Ask Wielun, ask Ostroleka, ask Zielona Gora! All these once thriving civilized places are in ruins, cinders, and for no reason but that the BARBARIAN vented its animal aggression on them! Ten thousand rapes were not enough for them, no. There’s not a Calisian city where their victims don’t walk, and a woman violated by those beasts WILL speak on this stand today! They ravage our women and children, again, and again, and again, and again! They cover their eyes with soot, like prostitutes!\"\n\nThe crowd started murmuring and a few citizens roared in approval. This was going the right way, at least a better way than the speaker on the other corner of the Forum.\n\n\"Citizens, the only good barbarian is the one on its knees. The only language a barbarian understands is that of fear and force. Through force of arms and the fear it elicits, we will tame even the worst of them! Only on their knees, only broken, can they ever amount to anything. They’re like bulls. They can only fuck around, and will amount to nothing until gelded into being oxen and thus turned to productive works. Nova Mediolana. Tarrenta.

calisia.148.desc: "When the Imperial Quaestor arrived in the gloomy village of Crerovia to ensure financial equity, as per the Senate's decree, he was met with a welcome far different than what he'd normally been used to. Despite the heavy downpour that turned the only road into the settlement into a barely traversable puddle of mud, rather than meet him with a threatening wall of pitchforks, each of the fifty or so remaining, poverty-stricken residents have taken time out of their day to greet Iulius with the finest collection of gifted local wares, each of similarly questionable quality. \n\nFor the last decade, Crerovia had been on a warpath, coveting the unprecedented, unearned wealth of the sole influential landholder in the area, holed up in his generational estate. Every attempt to forcefully seize it by the peasants had failed until eventually, the village regressed into a state of defeatist acceptance of their miserable fate. Today, Iulius would be their savior. Today, they would finally live like kings. \n\nAs the heavy rain gave way to an ominous storm, the peasants of Crerovia, along with their chained and screaming nemesis, gathered on a tiny hilltop, dwarfed by the massive pile of denarii, awaiting their share of the spoils with bated breath. And thus it began: \n\n- The first denarius goes to Sergius - the hunched villager approached, graciously taking the shining coin. \n- This one will go to Silvia - the aging eldress came forth, held up by two of her descendants. She picked up the denarius with her unusually pale hand before collapsing face-first into the dirt as flies swarmed what remained of her body. \n- Fine, the coin shall go to Elisea instead. Come receive what is rightfully yours. - A silence followed. - Umm, Elisea? Is there anybody here named Elisea? No? Hmm, guess I'll store it for safekeeping then. Now, I invite Mauritius to... \n\nWith a swarm of cheers and boos, the distribution process continued as the day turned to night and night turned to day once more. As Iulius continued with an increasingly tired voice, it seemed little headway had been made into the pile itself. \n\n- Sergius, and this coin is for you, your third of the day. It seems Crassus has blessed you on this fine evening. - the man approached and claimed his prize, as jubilant as ever. \n- And that concludes our fair and equal redistribution of your village's wealth. I hope everybody is satisfied because we sure knocked that oligarch down a peg! \n- Umm, Mr. Quaestor... - a weak figure asked. - What about the rest of the money? \n- Hmm, that? It's my fee for helping you guys out. It's only fair since I had to be on the clock for that entire time. My associate will be here soon to pick everything up. \n\nSeeing the rising anger of the villagers, Iulius hurriedly got on his horse, beyond the reach of their pitchforks. \n\n- Oh, and Sergius has more denarii than the rest of you now, so you might want to figure that out. Valete!"

calisia.149.desc: "Another day, another list. Pursuing financial crimes and tax evaders wasn't the dream assignment for any of the Vigiles, but to a poor cook's son like Iulianus, it was the only opportunity to experience a modicum of deserved comeuppance. Besides, the commission he got for each capture was nothing to scoff at. As long as it paid the bills, he'd be fine locking up the Emperor himself. Usually, it was some miserly merchant who thought he could earn a few extra bucks by cooking the books. However, he did sometimes wonder why he never got to bust anybody with actual wealth and connections. Perhaps they didn't trust him enough to handle the serious offenders? Well, looking at today's list, it really didn't seem like that was going to change anytime soon. It looked... unusually petty. He took a quick glance at the names: \n\n- Olivia Morosovica / 2 denarii 50 sesterces \n- Carolus Morosovicus / 4 denarii 99 sesterces \n- Sophia Novica / 1 denarius 99 sesterces \n- ... \n\nTens of names, none with a discrepancy large enough to buy a large pack of chips. And all with the local primary school as the main point of contact. Have the teachers been stealing stationery from their employers? Pitiable, but he did have to curb their excesses nonetheless. \n\nAs Iulianus' work hours didn't afford him the possibility to arrive after classes had ended for the day, he stepped into the school's empty halls and banged on the first available door. Interrupting in the middle of a basic spelling lesson, the officer turned towards the teacher, asking: \n- Uhh, did I find Mrs. Morosovica? Olivia Morosovica? \nA girl, barely older than eight, raised her hand. She answered gleefully. \n- I'm Olivia, Sir. Did I do something wrong? \n- You? But that's... So that means Carolus is... \n- My brother! - Her innocent smile turned to a visible frown. - Is he in trouble, Mr. Officer? \n\nStarting to sense the emerging pattern, Iulianus grabbed the class attendance sheet off the teacher's desk and began comparing it to the list of delinquents he was supposed to punish. A perfect match. His heart sank at the thought of what those soulless beasts over at the forum might do to the little rascals as retribution. He wished he could quit on the spot, but somebody else would instantly fill his position. Somebody who may not be so gentle. Alas, as difficult as it may be, a job is a job. Disgusted with himself, the officer completed his orders as always. \n\n- Alright kids, pack up and grab your wallets. Don't tell your parents, but we're going on a little trip to see the Forum Calisianum. Who's excited?"

calisia.150.desc: "Lit up only by Luna's faint glow and the dim flicker of a single lightbulb, strewn over the four corners of a specially ordered office table, laid the finest map of the Calisian Empire - the magnum opus of more than a dozen handsomely-paid cartographers. Markings dotted every single centimeter of the parchment, displaying a crowded web of population centers, from the mightiest metropoleis to the most remote villages, barely even touched by a quaestor's firm hand, each of them adorned with a small note listing the major issues highlighted by the local provincial governor. On the sides, piles of unopened letters marked the contours, likely complaints and suggestions from some powerless officials deep down the administrative chain. Dozens of peering eyes crowded around the map, drowning out the room’s ambient noise with vigorous chatter, with each of the unassuming attendees, bureaucratic apparatchiks whose painfully average visages could barely be ennobled by the finest grabs hanging onto their meek figures, taking turns loudly proclaiming the supposed virtues of his own vision and diminishing that of the previous speaker with equal vigor, undoubtedly taking satisfaction at the unearned sense of superiority it afforded. \n\nIt is no surprise that this atmosphere of a glorified kennel would hardly prove to be conducive to any consensus. With the paltry funds the Emperor managed to set aside from his bleeding budget, all the administrators could do was essentially fight for scraps. \n\n- And furthermore, I find it of critical importance that we fund the expansion of grain production around Alba Pomeraniae. An increase of... \n- Oh, you do, Philipus? You mean the same industry nearly monopolized by your brother? Why not just give him a handout while we’re at it, huh? \n- You’re one to talk, Andrius! No, no, let’s go back to your proposal for a second. Now tell me, who would get the contract to build that new district in Sedinum you suggested? Do they happen to share your last name by any chance? \n- Umm, hate to interrupt, but the municipium of Suebodinum requested clean drinking water. Surely we could... \n- No. Are we in agreement? Good. Now, back to the real issues. I am confident that a row of villas in Septembrum would entice wealthier citizens to settle and drive up local commerce... \n- Martinus, if you suggest villas one more time, I swear I will gut you with my own bare hands! \n\nA tense silence hung in the air following the threats. It had been the third time knives were drawn during the meeting, and even for the bureaucrats’ inflated egos, it was getting too much. Eventually, one of the senior officials spoke, one of the few people in the room commanding any sense of authority from his peers: \n- Oh damn it, just give everyone an aqueduct or something. Looks pretty, does the job... and, most importantly, it’ll shut them up for the time being.

The work of a bureaucrat is a thankless, monotonous one, and Dominicus often wished he'd be doing anything other than spending the best years of his life marking down every insignificant development in the Imperial Ledger. The routine was getting to his head, but he waved the thoughts aside and began to diligently sift through the massive pile of letters and reports stacked before him. \n\n> Marcus Visnovicus, 32, loan of 10000 denarii from the Central Bank - a quick note in the List of Debtors, and the paper was quickly tossed aside. \n> Paulus Copatus, 44, insurance claim after workplace injury - a scribble in yet another index and a sip of the coffee. Slightly too bitter, he'd have to ask his boss to replace the machine. \n> Ricardus Calisius, 81, found dead in the vicinity of the Imperial Palace... \n\nDominicus could hardly believe his eyes. He knew this day would eventually come, but why did it have to be so soon? Why did it have to be him? He felt guilty; as if he had just killed the Emperor by his own hand. But why did nobody report this? Was somebody trying to hide it? But then why break the news to some random clerk? Something had to be wrong, and he swore to get to the bottom of whatever conspiracy was brewing. His heart was racing, yet he did his best to compose himself and continue the day as if nothing had happened. If he were to investigate the matter, he could not afford to look suspicious. With trembling hands, he picked up the next report: \n\n> Ricardus Calisius, 28, has given birth to a daughter, Ricardus Calisius \n\nSomething had to be wrong. A plot? A misinformation campaign? He began to quickly look through the papers: \n\n> Ricardus Calisius, 7, has entered the XXII Elementary School \n> Ricardus Calisius, 38, divorced from his wife, Ricardus Calisius, 35 \n> Ricardus Calisius, 22... \n\nIt seemed nearly every report from the Barbarian District was the same.

calisia.159.desc: "Afternoon on a friday. The golden glow of the Calisian sunset filtered in through a half-shut office window, not giving quite enough light to warrant turning on the lights, but being just dim enough to make reading annoying. Most of the office had already gone home for the weekend, but not Marius. He was the unlucky soul that had to deal with the backlog of proposals for new Collegia left behind by the previous employee.\n\nHe tapped the eraser top of his pencil on the heavily aged wooden desk before him mindlessly as read the proposal before him. A sewer diver collegium... He couldn’t wrap his head around why something so specific would ever be required. He thought to himself,\n\n - How many sewer divers are there even in all of Calisia - ten or so? Wouldn’t that fall under the jurisdiction of the Collegium of Plumbers?\n\n He furrowed his brow as he tried to write a reason for rejection that made any semblance of sense. Technically the application was properly filled out, every “i” dotted, every “t” crossed... but it just didn’t speak to him. Eventually he settled on rejecting it on the grounds of “overlapping with another collegium”.\n\nThat one simple piece of paper took him around 15 minutes to trudge through. Five minutes longer than the last one. Either he’s slowing down, or these applications are getting to him... but wouldn’t that just mean the same thing? With a jittery hand he reached for his mug of coffee, maybe he had a few too many today, but it didn’t matter. He still had a neatly arranged pile of papers to go through.\n\nAnd so, Marius reached for the next paper with all the elegance of a drunkard by the local corner store, placing it squarely within his tired eyes’ view. The “Collegium for the admirers of Zenonas Iannicius” was the first thing that caught his eye. A state funded, fan club? With an exasperated sigh, he grabbed his pen and wrote up a note of rejection, grounds of not fitting within the criteria of a Collegium. That one was thankfully pretty simple, however the next one... The “Collegium for the fans of Zenonas Iannicius” soured that fleeting feeling of contentment. With an exasperated sigh Marius wrote a second letter of rejection, identical in every sense to the last.\n\nAs he reached for the next application, he felt a sinking feeling in his stomach. “The Collegium for Philosophical Debate”. He considered it for a moment. It sounded like a genuinely decent idea. Marius checked it in the database, no other Collegia similar to it were established yet, the paperwork checked out... So it was approved. The third one today out of several dozens of applications. With just a few more minutes left in his shift, Marius took a sip of his long cold coffee and picked up his last proposal for the day."

He hoped for an intelligent conversation but had to lower his expectations significantly to get anything out of the legionary he was interviewing at the military camp on the Fields of Mars. Organizing such an interview wasn’t easy; he first had to obtain three different permits, and in the end, an official from the Optimates faction closely monitored the entire conversation.\n\nHow would you describe the internal situation in the Legion?\n- You know, boys are doing well, it’s all good, but the problem is that basically we don’t have any more cash left, you know. HA! Last Tuesday, two homies had to figure out how to get their own armor because...\n- And honestly, the conditions our defenders have to endure are unacceptable, - interrupted the Optimate official, interjecting into the conversation - The state must provide additional funds so we can sleep safely without fear of invasion, so we can have faith that these brave patriots will be ever vigilant about foreign and domestic threats.\nBOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM.\nThere was a rumbling sound that echoed throughout the square.\n\n- You have to pay for your equipment yourselves? - Darius tried to continue.\n- Riiight? I also think it's stupid. We should get more fundaments, or whatever it's called. Money. Dough. More scrilla for this aquila, you know?\n- So... you’re saying it's a logistical issue?\n- No, no, to me it's not logical. Listen - shiiit, I even saw some boys stealing chairs out of the barracks, come on. Whaddaya need a damn chair for? They ain’t even comfy.\nAnd the word became flesh. As if on cue, a chair crashed out of the window of one of the barracks. Shortly after, one of the legionaries flew out through the newly created hole. From inside the building, the pounding music was now clearly audible. Darius wondered what was causing the tremors, but now he knew it was the fault of DJ Bassus Maximus. The entire party was visible in the camera frame set up by the journalist in the square. The official, seeing this, immediately gestured to turn the camera away and continue as if nothing had happened.\n- Whoa, Hubertus got carried away with the Gallic libation, niiiiice - the legionary seemed to be there in spirit with his comrades inside.\n- So as you can see, poor legionaries are lacking even windows in their barracks. How can they survive winter and have strength to defend our country? - Optimate clerk was still unbothered and nothing would convince him to drop his stance on this matter."

As his cart tumbled through the dirt roads leading to the unremarkable village of Roscia, every building, field, and tree that remained from the pre-exile days brought back a surge of memories. Playing with the hens as his mother called him for supper, his father letting him have a ride on the household tractor, and then, the bells; their chime summoning him for the weekly mass. It was this sound, this personal closeness he felt to his God that led him to break the family tradition and pursue a religious career. In those early years, everything felt so simple. He cared not for the people's overwhelming respect, but seeing the pews fill up in quiet reverence during each of his sermons warmed the heart of the young cleric. Then, the flock began to dwindle like the hairs on his scalp. Where did it all go wrong, he often wondered. \n\nAs he neared the church he called home, the faint odor of spirits and vomit brought Father Vladislaus back to reality. With each step, the assault on his nostrils worsened, sullying the return. The entire perimeter, what was left of the parish's modest garden, was covered in empty bottles of cheap spirits, wine carafes, and... he dared not look further, for he felt even the sight of some of the depraved items left behind by the area's previous occupants would be enough to corrupt his soul. Against his better judgment, he continued onward, reaching the church's wooden doors, barely hanging in their frames and with the inscription "PROPARTY OF DA BACCHANTS" carved across the whole length next to a frankly impressive collection of obscene drawings. He pushed through, entering the spiritual sanctum, turned into a den of ultimate degeneracy by this impure sect. With resignation, he got about to clearing the most salvageable of the corners, if so could be said about any of them. Bottles, more bottles, ugh, he hoped to never learn what the unknown substance now coating his fingers could possibly be. And is that... no, damn it, is there a dead body lying forgotten on the floor? \n\nFearing the worst, Father Vladislaus gave the cadaver's torso a slight poke. Lost in the panic thought of just how exactly he was going to report the death to imperial authorities, the priest failed to notice the corpse seemingly regaining its vital forces. \n\n- Oi, gov'na! Fetch me some wine, will ya? Been dyin' of thirst over here. \n- Oh, shoo off, you drunk. - The cleric found himself utterly repulsed by the personification of sin before him. - Come back once you've sobered up, and I'll help you find your way back to the light. \n- Drunk? I'll have you know, you skirt-wearing pansy, that I'm a repa... repra... representative of the largest Church with the Empire.

He could not handle the sheer audacity of his opponent, senator Micus. To call dirty foreigners and barbarians "potential citizens"? No, he could not stand for it. He would not allow it. And so as cheap drums started to play again some minutes later, he stood up eagerly. In that moment he didn't see himself different from his friends in the legions, bravely protecting every value that is Calisian.\n\n"Behold, my people, as swine opens our doors. \nA traitor, a snake that weakens our cause.\nTrue Callisians, you're my blood, not just deed.\nSo let's cut to the core of our nation's creed.\n\nFrom Poland’s fall, a lesson we glean,\nNot all are fit carrying Calisian scene.\nOnly the chosen, those who strive and toil,\nCan truly merge with our sacred soil.\n\nNot every seed in our garden grows,\nChoice plants thrive where the gardener knows.\nCarefully chosen, the stocks that do blend,\nOnly for worthy our fabric extend."\n\nThe confident smile, so iconic to Micus's image, didn't escape as she listened.

For what was supposed to be a means to get out of any potential crosshairs, ended in him walking side by side with the Emperor himself, escorted by two of his, their, Guardsmen. Calisius wished to have a private conversation with Christianus, and how could his loyal servant ever refuse such a call?\n\nSoon they arrived at the door to the palace’s meeting room. An opulent chamber, much like all the rest, adorned by a grand table set with many more seats than were ever necessary, vibrant, well tended plant life and bookshelves of tomes written by esteemed Calisian authors. The Guards accompanying, went to follow them in, however with a swift motion of the Emperor’s hand they stopped.\n\n- That won’t be necessary. Please wait for us outside, we won’t be too long.\n\nWith a quick nod and a shuffle of their armor, the Guardsmen stepped out, closing the door behind them. Loyal to a tee, well trained and behaved, he thought. Cinastovicus wasn’t especially impressed by the man before him. An aging, chubby man in laurels. Not the prime example of a strong ruler, but one he had to put a smile on for regardless. \n\n- Tell me Christianus, what kind of wine do you like the best? - Calisius spoke out, while walking towards the meeting room’s much coveted wine cooler. He spoke as if he was talking to a lifelong friend, a tone not very often heard coming from the Emperor, as he’s most often heard during grand, historical speeches, or drunken arguments.\n\n- Anything that doesn’t taste like mouthwash, or grape tincture. - The First Praetor said, almost on instinct. Of course he had his preferences, every self respecting citizen does, but those weren’t the topic of discussion at hand, or at least he hoped it wasn’t. He felt as if his answer didn’t even matter, as the Emperor turned to him with two wine glasses, each filled almost to the brim with a wonderfully deep red liquid.\n\n- How humble of you, Christianus. Here, drink. It’s Lazio. - The Emperor could barely keep a smile off his face as Cinastovicus accepted the wine. Soon after, he continued - Christianus, do you remember the first days of Calisia? Then it was only a little city, just as Rome had been. You have been there since the first days of its inception. I believe you’ve been indispensable, then and especially now. I wanted to thank you personally for the show of loyalty. Let us drink, to Calisia, ever eternal! - The Praetor smiled as he  raised his glass, not for the reason of being complimented, however. No, he didn't care much for that anymore. With a glass of imitation Lazio, Calisius had sealed his fate. The words spoken by him made it clear to Cinastovicus that the Auroch had lost its horns. The thought of an Emperor getting sappy with their subordinates at the smallest positive gesture made his skin crawl. He was no longer the man who had forged the Res Publica, he now was just an old coot with more power than he could even think to use. \n\nThough, with those thoughts swirling around in the back of his head, Christianus responded without any hesitation,"

It almost felt like he was a lawyer again...\n\nSitting on his throne, or a rather highly decorative armchair handmade for him by a local artisan he read and read. All the ministries and institutions’ reports were just a bland mess by now. He propped his head up with one hand and with lazy eyes he glanced over at the door to his throne room, where he saw one of his palace stewards. Trying not to appear startled, he looked at the clock to see if he missed an appointment, before clearing his throat and speaking.\n\n - Oh! My apologies, I didn’t hear you come in. What is it that you require?\n\nThe servant scratched his head, not entirely sure how to begin, but he soon said\n\n - There is a visitor, my Emperor. He says he is an envoy from the northern Aldermanship. He claims to carry a message of grave importance.\n\n - A messenger from Rota? Very well, allow him to enter.\n\nWith a quick motion the servant leaned his head out the door and gestured for the envoy to enter,  exchanging a few words in what the Emperor could’ve sworn sounded like Polish. Then to his surprise a man dressed in a żupan and kontusz, topped with a highly decorated hat which he threw off his head as he fell to his knees before the Emperor’s imposing magnitude. Before Calisius could shake his shock, or even formulate a question, the delegate spoke.\n\n - Emperor Ryszardus Kaliszus the First! I come before you in a time of true need. The tyrant, Przemysł the Third of Gniezno threatens the liberty and safety of the Aldermanship of Koło. Alderman Kazimierz himself offers to swear fealty to your Imperial Highness in exchange for protection against the encroaching despot!\n\nThe Emperor set aside his papers and considered the request. Rota, or Koło as they call it, is entirely at the Res Publica’s, or rather his mercy. The Alderman is weak, there’s no denying that. Subjugating his statelet would be Calisia’s easiest conquest. However, who’s to say that a once disloyal subject, wouldn’t just turn to another overlord if their lands are encroached upon?

post_calisia.1.desc: "The worst has happened. Another pivotal moment in the history of civilization, following the Fall of Rome and the Fall of Constantinople. Calisia has fallen. The exact details of the city's final hours under siege remain unclear, but it is known that Ricardus Calisius was seen among the crowd, encouraging the defenders to fight. The emperor vanished after that. The besieged capital withstood the onslaught of barbarian hordes for a considerable time. The final hope was the legions of the foederatii under the command of Donaldus Tusc, who were supposed to relieve the encircled city.\n\nIt is known that the Germanic forces were indeed forced to retreat, and the city gates were opened to welcome the allied soldiers who had come to save the eternal city. However, instead of a triumph for Calisia's forces, a massacre ensued. Those who were meant to be liberators from the barbarian yoke became the ultimate gravediggers of the Empire. The troops under Tusc’s command completely ravaged the capital. The palace was seized, and within it, Calisius’s children were taken captive and forced to pay homage to Tusc, who proclaimed himself King of the Veneti. The Senate, under coercion, confirmed Tusc's rule, making him the sole and undisputed ruler of the Empire—or rather, the Kingdom. However, his undisputed rule lasted only a few hours before news of the capital's fall spread to the farthest corners of the empire, initiating the fragmentation of Calisia’s power.\n\nPossessing the capital of a dying Empire may hold significant importance in the new world that will emerge from the ruins... but it may not be as great an advantage as it might seem."

post_calisia.2.desc: "The elevation of Tusc to the throne was a crucial moment for the hegemony of the barbarians over the neo-antique world of Calisia. Not only did it break the spirit of the remaining defenders of the Empire, but it also led to the most treacherous treaty since the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. The newly crowned King of the Veneti allotted each Germanic warlord their own parcel of land carved from the corpse of Calisia.\n\nIn the far north, the raiding Jutes received the estuary of the Viadrus River, along with the important metropolis of Sedinum, ensuring their dominance in this part of the Mare Balticum. From Veluntia to Cholberga, the coast of Pomerania Occidentalis was set ablaze and fell prey to Jute invasions, not for the first time in history.\n\nThe Franks settled in the territories in Germania vacated by the Goths, as well as lands across the river reaching the borders overlapping with Terra Lebusana, with strongholds in Suebodinum, Landsbergum, and Piriseum, even though they did not move their seat from Francofortum. Now, they possess a city on both sides of the river, finally united.\n\nThe Saxons became one of the major hegemons in the region, as they not only settled in Lower Silesia, extending as far as Lugidunum and Prasia Elysiorum, but also managed to reclaim the territories of Saxony, which were plunged into anarchy, further strengthening their position.\n\nThe Vandals and their offshoot, the Silingi, settled all of Silesia from Budorgis to Catovicia, and now the conglomerate of these two tribes jointly possesses one of the strongest economies remaining in this ruined world. Only time will tell if they can capitalize on this advantage."

However, a second great war was simultaneously unfolding on the eastern flank, marked by fewer but equally significant battles. It can be argued that the eastern front infamously etched its name in the annals of history as the site of the greatest devastation, where entire cities were razed, and the casualty rates in battles were enormous, often leaving only about 10% of the forces on either side alive.\n\nThe Aestii pillaged their way as far as the gates of the Mariaeburgum stronghold, conquering almost the entire Borussia region for themselves. Most of their recruits comprised the Russian population previously subjugated by Calisia, whose occupation was deemed exceedingly oppressive. Now, the tides had turned, and the Aestii confederation of tribes exacted their revenge.\n\nIn the far south, the Scythians ruled, proving to be the least oppressive of the three eastern powers. The previously strong Ukrainian population in Calisia's territories ensured that Lublinum fortunately did not share the fate of other cities burned by invaders. The sparse population density also worked in favor of the local inhabitants. However, this did not mean the region was spared the ravages of war. The Scythians did sack and plunder, with cities laid to waste such as Rubrumium and Zamoscia.\n\nThe most dreadful harbinger of death and destruction was the bloodthirsty horde of Huns under the command of Khan Khonoon I. Podlachia suffered a fate worse than mere death, with war destruction reaching approximately 90% of urban structures. Albacliva now resembled a rubble-strewn wasteland, no longer recognizable as a city. The fleeing population could not escape the mounted troops led by the personification of Hades himself, the khan. The number of people slaughtered surpassed any imaginable measure of human cruelty, and the lands traversed by the horde make Mars seem like a more habitable environment."

Limiting their plundering to a minimum, it appears that the new rulers of these lands intend to stay for the long term, as their settlement efforts have commenced in full force.\n\nThe Ostrogoths found themselves in a privileged position, securely located between the Vistula and Notis rivers, with powerful fortresses under their control, such as Bidgostia, Thorunia, and Vladislavia. Despite an informal alliance with the new ruler in Calisia, there are rumors that the ambitions of the Ostrogoth king extend to the boundaries of the Eternal City, and it is possible that another war may soon erupt, this time between the barbarians themselves.\n\nThe Visigoths, on the other hand, moved along the Varta River, where they established their kingdom. Their borders stretch as far as the Montes Calvi range. However, their settlement efforts have encountered significant resistance from the local population, with the fiercest battles currently being fought over the metropolis of Navis, whose western part is occupied by the Goths and the eastern part by partisans belonging to militias identifying with the Kingdom of Judah."

But the people survived. And it was upon the shoulders of these survivors that the mission to secure the legacy of the Calisian Empire rested.\n\nBefore the siege of the capital, most of the treasury was fortunately evacuated to Constantia, where Governor Trascovicus generously took care of the remaining wealth of Calisia. This also provided him with a pretext to declare himself emperor, which he did without waiting for anyone else. Believing that he held the historical civilizational imperative in his hands and was compelled by circumstances to act, he proclaimed the Eastern Calisian Empire, promising that one day Calisia would be reunited as one. This proved to be a masterstroke, as fleeing dignitaries chose Constantia as their only viable refuge.\n\nHowever, Trascovicus was not the only governor with similar ambitions. Acting on the basis of nomenclature, Governor of Pomerania, Phaon Alnus, declared himself the heir to Calisia. Residing, fittingly, in Nova Calisia, he believed this was the only correct model of succession. Calisia could only be succeeded by Calisia. Unfortunately, his eccentric style and tendency towards vulgar outbursts have caused him to be taken less seriously in the race for the legacy of the Empire.\n\nIn Antecarpathia, a coronation also took place, as former popular leader and legate, Silvius Iacobinus, declared himself King of the Calisians. This is a distinct category from declaring oneself emperor and represents a considerable drop in prestige, but Silvius views himself as a people's ruler, and his domain as the people rather than a metaphysical representation of the state. Regardless of Silvius's potential as a great philosopher-king, his propensity for alcohol abuse means he is also not taken very seriously.\n\nThe strongest claims to the throne of Calisia would naturally belong to the sons of Ricardus, especially his eldest son, Ignatius. After the fall of Calisia, he survived by swearing fealty to Donaldus Tusc and even managed to escape the city, only to find himself in further peril when he reached the city of Nissa, where the local garrison immediately crowned him Emperor upon his entry through the city gates. Unfortunately, Silesia became overrun by barbarians, and Nissa found itself surrounded on all sides. One brave city now holds the hordes of hell at its gates, but those gates are beginning to crumble, and our Emperor's future seems very dark and full of terrors."

After the fall of the Empire, those legions that were not destroyed disbanded on their own. However, those who still desired to fight for lost ideals and a lost cause organized themselves into increasingly larger armed groups. Of the entire military machinery of the Empire, only two legions survived in a state of combat readiness and organizational structure.\n\nLegio I Alpha, a legendary unit composed of the most loyal and battle-hardened soldiers, endured a campaign that would rival even that of Alexander the Great. However, they paid for their experience with painful losses; in addition to many veterans, their eminent commander, Marcus Vinicius, also gave his life for the Empire. Currently, the legion has managed to retreat to the very edge of the Montes Carpathii, where they are regaining strength and gathering remnants of other forces.\n\nIn Masuria, another legion survived - Legio XXXVII Fanatica, renowned for its battles against the Huns, whom they held at bay for a long time. However, after their defeat at the Battle of Acrimorum, fate seems to be turning against the legionaries. Despite heroically holding the Suvalca corridor under the emblem of the crucian carp, they are likely to be forced to retreat due to fighting on two fronts; otherwise, they face the threat of annihilation."

By utilizing the infrastructure in Plocensia and their extensive network of contacts, they have managed to preserve their influence in the region and are becoming pioneers in the renewed trade among the remnants of the empire.\n\nThe primary beneficiary of this trade has become the Carthagdinian Empire. Emulating its namesake, it has taken control of most coastal territories, effectively seizing the empire’s maritime industry and entire fleet. A new power is emerging in the Pomeranian Tripolis, eager to dominate the entire region under its banner.\n\nHowever, to achieve this, they face a rather absurd obstacle. In Sluchovia, a mystical ceremony elevated a prophet to the status of a deity. Iaroslaus Ultimus has declared himself the Emperor of the Last Days, and the whole situation resembles a dangerous cult more than an ordinary warlord. Nevertheless, Iaroslaus intends to lead his followers into an ultimate battle against the forces of evil, after which he believes the apocalypse and the kingdom of God will ensue. At least, that is his conviction."

post_calisia.8.t: "Far over Tatra Mountains"
post_calisia.8.desc: "The most tranquil territories were usually found in the mountain meadows, and this was largely the case during the conquest of the mountains by Calisia. There were no grand battles, spectacular events, or heroic duels. It was a simple case of "Veni, vidi, vici," followed by silence. However, politics abhors a vacuum, and soon after Calisia burned, the local garrisons decided to act. To protect the mountain strongholds from devastation, they chose their own Emperor. The choice fell on the beloved Robert Makłowicz, who accepted the position but not the title. To add an oriental touch to the new entity, Makłowicz took on the protection of the Armenian population, which had been flocking to the region in recent years. Given his Armenian roots, he became their idol.\n\nThe chaos also provided an opportunity for the Czechs, who freed themselves from German influence, effectively throwing out Berlin's authority. With the collapse of Calisia, they took a step further and crossed borders that had remained unchanged since World War II. As a result, Tessin and Glacium once again became part of the Czech lands, and they also annexed the territories of Ricmondia and Leobschucium. It appears unlikely that they will return these territories this time."

post_calisia.9.t: "Sparta or Spartacus?"
post_calisia.9.desc: "The harsh conditions lead to a rather drastic upbringing; while a tough and severe environment may forge a strong warrior, it does so at the expense of weaker individuals. These weaker individuals often fell prey to the Empire’s ruthless policies that permitted slavery. Indeed, slavery was one of the pillars of Calisia's economic prosperity. In the modern world, however, traditional slavery cannot meet societal needs in the long run, and enslaved groups quickly transform into organized factions, verging on becoming terrorist organizations.\n\nThe industrial lands of Dabrovia, Pinus, and Osviecimia were the epicenters of slave labor, where factories operated around the clock, and slaves perished from exhaustion akin to the worst concentration camps. It is no surprise that it was in these territories that the Spartacus Union arose. Drawing inspiration from both their ancient namesake and the German namesake, they sought to dismantle Calisia's entire machinery of slavery. Now, as the Empire collapses under its own weight, Lucas Lituanus has vowed to liberate all people, both from the yoke of post-imperial warlords and barbarian kings.\n\nSpartacus, Spartans. The northern neighbors of the Spartacus Union were quite similar in name but not in a concept. Based on the sports club Sparta Lubliniec and the military units stationed in the city of Lobin, they founded an entirely new society aimed at reviving Spartan ideals. As expected, this state was not very lenient towards its citizens and quickly became a target for the Spartacus revolutionaries. Will the unwavering spirit of popular liberation overcome the fanatical warriors who uphold the bloody ideals of ancient Greece?"

post_calisia.10.t: "Gaulician Disarray"
post_calisia.10.desc: "Gaulicia. It does not precisely have Gauls, although there are some. The Gaulician Confederation represents a crucial piece in the post-collapse puzzle of southeastern Calisia. While it draws more inspiration from Galicia than Gaul, under the leadership of Ricardus Gaulus, the confusion persists among its citizens. Despite the bewildering nomenclature, the confederation, among the three newest factions, seems to offer a decent place to live, free from oppression, wars, and exploitation.\n\nSpeaking of exploitation, north of Galicia, a conglomerate of partisans originating from the football club Widzew Łódź has formed the Kingdom of Judah. Although it does not yet have a messiah, considering the irrationality of the entire situation, this would surprise no one. They are currently engaged in a struggle for their holy land—complete control over the city of Navis against the Visigoths. However, looming on the other side is the Eastern Calisian Empire, which harbors ambitions of restoring the entire Imperium, potentially reducing the Kingdom of Judah to a minor province in its grand machinery once again.\n\nOn the opposite end of the divine state of Prophet Iaroslaus lies an equally peculiar entity rooted in Egyptian mythology. The mounds located in the city of Cracovia are proclaimed to be ancient pyramids! While this may not be the most coherent scientific theory, it did not prevent the establishment of the Pharaonate of Khrak. Here, the pharaoh lies mummified, not alive but at least not ruling. Unfortunately, the great regent, an oracle, and the court sorcerer, Astrampsychus, governs in his place. The burning question remains — will they succeed in erecting a Sphinx in the marketplace of Cracovia?"

unification.31.desc: "In a radio broadcast to all of Greater Poland, an address was given by none other than Ryszard Kalisz; Though anyone who has been around the region can say that the man speaking was no longer the same as everyone knew him before the Fall, going under the name Ricardus Calisius, all signs point to the politician seeking to establish a new Roman Empire in the heart of Poland. Through skillfully swaying the local political figures he had managed to become a major contender in the region through semi-modernized Roman reforms. An army of Legionnaries, coinage with the Emperor’s facade and new marble buildings soon to be constructed in recently romanized cities really give off the look of being brought back to the distant past. It remains to be seen what will arise from this state of pseudo-Roman reenactors, though it goes without saying that even if their folly is to end, the Polish-Roman state will no doubt go down in history as another in a long list of oddities resulting from the Fall."

Sources on the ground state that the city might soon earn its status of a metropolis in more ways than just the descriptor. Latinized signage branding the city as Posnania has already sprung up in place of the old road signs and plaques on administrative buildings. However, for most of the newly integrated population, life may not be getting much brighter as only a select few are granted the honor of becoming “citizens” of Calisia, the rest ending up as second class citizens, referred to as Wends, as per the ancient name for western slavs. Worryingly, those not of Polish descent within the so-called Republic have found themselves subject to slavery and systematic repression. Calls from the UN to stop this treatment of especially German citizens have fallen on deaf ears and an extraordinary summit to debate on the issue will be held in Berlin in the coming months. "

As with lands formerly integrated into the nation’s structures, countless civilians have found themselves on the receiving end of Calisian repression. Even foreign delegations arriving to the capital of the same name, have found themselves branded as Barbarians, and treated unequally to the region’s citizens. It is unclear if European structures will permit trade with the state, despite efforts made to entice foreign investment. Though few would like to admit it, with each day it becomes clearer that those wishing to establish an embassy in Poland may soon need to throw out their Polish textbooks and pick up a new set for learning Latin.

After a decade of post-Fall anarchy, the nation has been fully reunified under the so-called Imperator Ricardus Calisius, a former SLD politician turned monarch. After crowning himself the emperor of the crumbling city of Kalisz, the Caesar earned the public’s favor, rebuilding the city in a neoclassical style from a pile of rubble into a truly worthy capital. With dozens of loyal legions under his command and the spirit of Augustus coursing through his veins, the great conqueror managed to subdue the entirety of the country, not even the barbarian kings of Varsovia and Cracovia able to stop his advance. \n\nFollowing the final Triumh, a grand celebration ensued with Calisian wine flowing in unending excess. The task ahead remains monumental, however, as rebuilding the ruined economy and Romanizing the millions of new citizens may prove to be an even greater challenge. \n\nThe Empire of Calisia shall ensure its eternal place in the sun!"

With a truly united Imperium, strengthened by all the adversities it faced, Augustus Calisius looks to his side, at Princeps Ignatius with a hopeful smile. His health is waning, but he knows he can entrust the rule to his beloved son who will carry on his glorious legacy. Behind them stood the Imperator's right hand man, Legate Vinicius the architect of the Imperial military might, who looked on proud on his countless Legionaries. Having defeated all his political enemies, he proved his worth to the Imperator. For his unwavering loyalty and faithful service, he was granted the title of Princeps Senatus.

As the ruler enjoyed himself, celebrating with his many guests, the three conspirators accompanied by a large escort of Senate Guards, Legionaries and Praetorians, seized the Augustus and ended his life with numerous dagger stabs. The Calisian Triumvirate was born through tyrannicide and as Imperial blood soaked the pavement, conspirators spread out to finalize the seizure of power.

Today a grand ceremony took place in the Calisian capital, where Christianus Cinastovicus proclaimed the unification of all Polish lands. Three loud "Ave!" echoed across the city, before a massive parade marched to the cheer of a crowd of ecstatic citizens. With the land united, Praefectus Praetoriae looks on beyond the borders of the Imperium he created, but his plans remain a mystery to everyone but him. Veni, Vidi, Vici."

The bleeding, dying Imperator looked on as the Praefectus Praetoriae commenced a purge against all still loyal to him.

With beautiful words and diplomatic finesse, he proclaimed that his goal was simply to end the tyranny of Augustus Calisius and hand the rule to the Consuls of the Senate. To standing ovations, he terminated his position of Dictator Perpetua and returned to his duties.

Today a grand ceremony took place, as the Imperial throne was claimed by a renowned and popular, Martinus Naimanus. A gladiator by profession and a renowned province governant of Vartia, he spoke of how he now shall crack down on any enemies the Imperium had, has or will have. Warrior-Augustus also presided over inaugural gladiator games - the Fama Mixta Martialis Artes, bringing bread and games to the masses of citizens crowded around the capital.

Local garrisons have been dispatched to the breached gate, but soon distress calls started to multiply as more and more Limes reported similair stories. With the crisis looming, Senate called all Consuls for an emergency session. A grand, heated debate ensued between the Populares under Vinicius who argues that these are refugees and Imperium in its benevolence should show mercy, and Optimates under Caletus, who want the Augustus to stand fast and destroy the invaders.

Following a dissolution of European Union, German economy faced unprecedented, spiralling collapse, which fueled the fire of dissent in all corners of the Republic. With police stretched thin and military engaged outside the country, German government fell apart and power shifted to local warlords fighting each other for control. As tiny nation states broke off from Germany one after another, the German people found themselves between a hammer and an anvil. Most of them decided to stay and try to find themselves in their new, shattered reality, but a large number of those able, have picked up what they could carry and made their way outwards, to neighbouring countries still standing.

As enemy troops entered the city, they saw the dirty and hopeless ruins of a delusional state, before unseen and hidden from outsiders by pompous Imperials. Soldiers of the invading force tear down the hanging Calisian banners and set them aflame, while some of the more industrious of them have set their sights on the Imperial palace and its secluded riches. Roadsigns with the old, almost forgotten name "Kalisz" are set up yet again by incoming logisticians tasked with supplying the captured city. With the Augustus, along with his Senators nowhere to be found and with remnants of destroyed Legions hunted down or dispersed in deep forests, it is safe to say, nothing short of a miracle can save the Imperial dream of Calisia.

POLITICS_RICARDUS_CALISIUS_DESC: "A former socialist, lawyer, politician – hardly the most respectable Cursus Honorum, although a typical one. For all of his life, Ryszard Kalisz felt some kind of yearning in the back of his mind. He could feel it while walking past the columns of the Supreme Court, inscribed with ancient legal maxims, watching Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra, or even just eating pizza. Whenever he held a speech, be it in court or in Sejm, he could feel the presence of someone far greater and wiser than the jury or the Marshal of the Sejm behind him. Back then, he would simply dismiss it and carry on. \n\nIt was right after the Fall his inner consciousness had awoken. Running away (either from the blast or the angered mob), he hid in a wine cellar in Kalisz. Whatever happened there will be forever shrouded in mystery. On the third day, he emerged, draped in a bedsheet tinted purple with Latium wine, with a golden laurel on his head and perfect knowledge of all five Latin declensions. \n\nHowever odd Kalisz wouldn’t seem, the locals did greatly appreciate his restlessness and organizational talent. No one batted an eye when he ordered officials to wear togas or enforced Latin nomenclature. However, when he proclaimed himself the descendant of Jupiter, some people thought he might be going too far. By then, however, his rule had already been cemented. Kalisz approached members of local elites and offered them an attractive deal: land in exchange for political power. Soon afterward, the Senate convened and proclaimed Kalisz – now Ricardus Calisius – first, a consul for life and, soon after – the emperor of Calisia. The new dictator’s first edict shocked many to the bone: he reinstituted a form of indentured servitude, which turned out to be little more than thinly veiled slavery. \n\nCalisius walks a tightrope between the Optimates, which aim to seize as much wealth and power as possible, and the Populares, who point out the crying inequality in the nascent empire. The conflict is amplified by the uncertainty surrounding Calisius’ mental state. As mad as he seems, he did manage to reforge this piece of post-Fall Poland into a strong, well-functioning statelet. His past made many think he’d turn out to be an opportunist, but his decision to uphold democratic traditions by empowering the Senate proved he is just as much a Cincinnatus as an Augustus. The true extent of the Emperor’s ambition – or folly – will soon be unraveled..."
POLITICS_pawel_delag_DESC: "Once upon a time an actor named Paweł Deląg played a bad-boy-turned-good-guy Marcus Vinicius in a grandiose ancient Rome epic called Quo Vadis. Thus he earned a certain fame and reputation as „Poland sexiest actor of 2001", while helping shape the image of a gory, immoral Roman Empire transforming into a more humane, Christian Europe. \n\nThat’s perhaps why Deląg, as soon as atomic dust settled, moved where ruins were modern and reconstruction was ancient.\n\nIt’s hard to assume whether he offered his service to Calisius out of conviction, lust for power or pure opportunism, or was simply bought. Nonetheless, placed at the helm of the legions, he quickly became the icon of the regime, most likely because he was the one who truly seemed like he was the right man in the right place. The people listen to his words, and the affection with which legionaries follow him would be hard to outweigh with money. Magnanimous, outgoing and tolerant, Vinicius quickly became a leader of the popular faction, believing that the new Eternal City can be a place where everyone can be a citizen of equal rights and duties; where bread and circuses serve a better purpose than controlling the masses. \n\nMarcus’ charm and popularity act like a column holding Calisius’ regime standing. It would seem the emperor’s past makes him sympathetic to popular ideas. The caesar could not think of a better friend... But can a friendship last forever?"
