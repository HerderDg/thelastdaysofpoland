You will marvel at the economic opportunities provided by this development, and you will be granted the unique opportunity to regularly marvel at the divine visage of our princeps. You will soon come to realize that the Imperium Calisianum is not that dissimilar from your former state when it comes to demanding obedience and respect. Of course, the latter is just a mere imitation of the former. In a few weeks, your labor will enrich our society!

From now on, all barter trade has been deemed illegal, while obsolete currencies can be traded in for appropriate compensation during the transition period.

No one may feel safe as the barbarians kill both the hardworking plebian settlers, but also the illustrious patricians. Both men and women and even the children fall victim to their spears as those horse-riding monsters know no mercy. The might Calisius has sent his faithful legions to the region to punish the rebels. Let us hope they will prevent the blood-thirsty Scythians from gaining any more support from their primitive brethren.

The servants will be protected by Calisian law, which will force the patricians to uphold their part of the contract. Calisius hopes that in the future this institution will be the backbone of the imperial economy. All of those responsible for the Trucidatio Ravitiensis will be forced into such servitude under harsher than usual conditions.

Henceforth, to protect Calisian citizens and ensure the stability of our empire, the vast majority of the primitive peoples that we will conquer in the future... WILL! BE! ENSLAVED!

Soon, important matters of state will be discussed, along with the Senate’s usual duties. Citizens are once again welcome to send letters with matters they see as important enough to discuss. Mail meant to demean or poke fun at the Senate, will be punished with a fine of 50 Calisian denarii. Talks of arguments or violent confrontations within the Senate halls are nothing but hearsay and baseless lies. The Emperor guarantees that all bodies of the Res Publica are dignified and untarnished places of nothing but diligent work, with no troublemakers, or bullies."

Elections for the seats will be held in exactly two weeks from this day. Citizens who wish to partake in the democratic process, can vote at the nearest polling station. Addresses of said locations will be announced a week before the election date. The glorious title of Senator comes with many benefits, including lodging in the luxurious senatorial villas, as soon as one becomes available."

CAL_lex_indentatae_servitutis: "Lex Indentatae Servitutis"
CAL_lex_indentatae_servitutis_desc: "The question of slavery raised during the Senate's ongoing session! Following the tragic events in Rawicz, a handful of Populares have occupied the rostrum, demanding an immediate end to Calisia's system of forced labor! After a long spat, the factions have agreed to put the matter to a vote, resulting in a more moderate proposal by the reformers to transition to a temporary form of servitude with an option to buy out one's contract after a specified period of work. Concerned about the economic impact, the Optimates demand the labor to instead be performed by subservient populations, enshrining their status as Servi in return for the state providing them housing and appropriate sustenance. Large protests of barbarian groups have erupted in opposition to the proposal."

CAL_lex_militae: "Lex Militae"
CAL_lex_militae_desc: "Reinforcements for the army imminent as the Senate finalizes a new bill regarding conscription! In response to requests by Legate Vinicius and other high military commanders, the chamber has swiftly and collectively agreed to expand current conscription laws to ensure a larger force capable of supporting all theaters of war. After a promising start, the issue has bogged down around the matter of which groups should be included in the decree, with the Populares advocating for the founding of barbarian formations as a supplement for the current manpower issues. Claiming them to be untrustworthy and their loyalty to Calisia to be unclear, the Optimates vehemently oppose this idea, claiming that size can be sacrificed and that their smaller, professional army will be far more effective against external threats. While the factions remain polarized on the issue, the final shape of the bill will likely be decided by a handful of undecided senators, unless a passable compromise can be found."

CAL_lex_tributorum: "Lex Tributorum"
CAL_lex_tributorum_desc: "The solution to the Empire's financial woes drawing nearer! A consensus has been reached among all factions regarding the necessity of a tax reform, and plans have been introduced to the Senate by both parties highlighting the areas where further funds could be obtained for the treasury. True to their name, the Populares insist on an increased tax on the wealthy to not only fix the budgetary deficit but also ease the burden on the impoverished. Outraged at what they refer to as "an attack on those contributing the most to our shared prosperity," the Optimates have instead opted for increased financial obligations on barbarians residing within imperial territory, deemed a more-than-overdue repayment for the benefits they reap. Due to multiple factions and action groups weighing in on the issue, the deadlock is expected to continue for now."

They say the the most vile of criminals should die a painful death for their transgressions, in public might I add. Despite the rumors only a slight minority of Optimates supports crucifixion and this method of execution will not find itself in the official act. As always, they are opposed by the Populares, who are of the opinion that if we can in time civilize the barbarians then we should succeed at civilizing the bandits, especially since some of them are native Calisians."

CAL_lex_iuononis: "Lex Iunonis"
CAL_lex_iuononis_desc: "Decisive actions by the Senate regarding the status of women in the empire! A heated debate rages on between the factions, with two separate legislations introduced. The delegation of the Populares has promised radical reforms, fully granting female citizens all legal rights and protections, including a total ban on the mistreatment and non-consensual capture of female barbarians. A counter-proposal has been introduced by the Optimates, promising increased rights, but emphasizing the importance of traditional roles, and vowing to extend protections only to those bound by Calisian law.

The Populares promise sweeping change, aiming to extend citizenship to anyone of sufficient status residing on the Empire's territory, should they prove their service to His Grace, Ricardus Calisius. The bipartisanship of this proposal has been rejected by the Optimates, who instead advocate for a one-time financial tribute, equal to the monthly upkeep of a maniple. All affected are asked to refrain from displays of support for their preferred option, so as to not influence the natural course of the debate."

At the personal request of the Emperor, as a result of our growing territory and constant increase in non-Calisian subjects, the Senate has agreed to consider the issue of whether barbarian-born individuals can truly be inducted into our superior culture. As per the statement of the Populares, 'to be Calisian is a matter not of birth, but rather a result of embracing our common values.' Senators loyal to the faction wish to secure funding for extensive cultural programs to enlighten the subjugated populations. In response, the Optimates postulate that certain groups are inherently barbaric, and to teach them our ways would merely be a waste of resources. \n\nCitizens are welcome to voice their opinions on the matter. A poll will be conducted shortly, asking whether residents of the Eternal City would be comfortable considering a person of barbarian origin as a fellow Calisian."

A vocal progressive sub-faction of the Populares managed to force the inclusion of the matter in the chamber's proceedings, pushing for legislation to recognize and grant protections for long-standing partnerships. The proposal has sparked outrage within the conservative wing of the Optimates, who claim it to be an overt attack on Calisian values and traditions. Their counter-bill vows to evoke the example of our ancient forebearers, allowing males to sleep with others of strictly lower status, as long as the citizen in question takes the dominant role. \nThe final version of the act is expected to be signed into law by the conclusion of the next Mensis."

CAL_lex_religionis: "Lex Religionis"
CAL_lex_religionis_desc: "Matter of religious direction introduced before the Senate! Demands for complete secularization of the Empire by the radicals within the Populares have led to a rare three-way split within the chamber, with the opposition failing to decide on the one true pantheon. While the cult of Jupiter has gained significant popularity within the ranks of the Optimates, many see a return to polytheistic practices as a step too far. A wide coalition has formed, straddling both sides of the aisle, in a bid to preserve the special status of Catholicism and formally recognize it as the primary religion of Calisia. According to a prominent member of our beloved legislative, the deadlock has been ongoing since the opening of the session and is expected to continue well into the coming weeks."

Francofortum Orientalis, Costrinum, Gryphonia, Svina Ostium have fallen victim to siege by invaders from Hades! \n\nIn the eastern fringes of the Empire, a pale fear has also fallen upon the monstrous hordes of Huns, Scythians, and Aests. Countryside may be burning, but we shall not lie dormant and open our gates to be pillaged and raped!\n\nAs we speak, our legions are mobilizing to defend our lands from this barbarian onslaught. Every man and woman capable of bearing arms is called upon to join the ranks of our noble defenders, for it is only through our unity and sheer will that we shall emerge victorious!\n\nSo rally to the call of duty, my fellow citizens!

We also encourage contributions to the collegiums organizing food supplies for our brave defenders.\n\nGuardians of the Empire! Fear not!

Those who have received specialized assignments to the southern front, please proceed to hall B. The rest of you, please remain here, as most will be heading west to protect the Calisian civilization.\n\nFear not the darkness!

The central government will collaborate with provincial governors so that even the most remote corners under our rule do not feel isolated.\n\nAid from the capital will depart swiftly, and a senatorial attaché will also travel to each province to oversee preparation and defense against both external and internal threats. Supply lines will flow incessantly, guarded by armed patrols to prevent them from falling prey to barbarians or bandits.\n\nFrom Pomerania to the Antecarpathia, the citizens of Calisia can rest assured about their lives and property - we will be wherever we are needed - always ready, and always close.

However, the Optimates disagree, seeing them only as a threat that must be crushed as quickly and brutally as possible, so that every subsequent barbarian will think twice before crossing our borders!\n\nThe decree from the Prefect of the Cohortes Urbanae states that any attempts to destabilize the situation in the capital through agitation from both sides will be quashed, political assemblies are not allowed, and collegia will also be subjected to revision and control to limit polarization and panic.

With kindness, we shall overcome hatred, and instead of closing the gates and playing the besieged fortress, we will approach this in a civilized manner. Citizens!

Any acts of aggression will be condemned by the Cohortes Urbanae. Be prudent; it is not worth ending up in the dungeons due to the hateful whims of a soul devoid of any dignitas.

Not destroy.\n\nSilesia Inferior will receive a mighty boost it needs to once again become the multicultural heart of Central Europe.

Expansion of the limitanei guard is planned on the western limes, along with the establishment of appropriate refugee points so that the entire operation of rescuing fleeing people is organized, not chaotic. We are not guardians guarding the treasure; rather, we want to share that treasure with all of you in a civilized manner. Limes Occidentalis will be fortified!

An opportunity for final reconciliation and the unification of our nations under the banner of shared ideals expressed by the Empire of Calisia.\n\nThe northern territories, mainly in the province of Pomerania, are sparsely populated. It would be inhumane to reject our brethren in need when we ourselves have suitable places for them to live. The tribes of the Goths, as the largest of the refugee groups, have been offered autonomous lands in the forests of Pomerania that they can develop according to their own preferences.\n\nThis treaty will be overseen by Donaldus Tusc, our man in the Germanic camp, and in the name of peace and prosperity, he will ensure that everything goes smoothly. Soon, we will live together in one great empire. Beyond divisions."

With the treaty signed with the Goths, we gain a military ally who has many people ready to fight from now on shoulder to shoulder with us against those who threaten the newly emerging Pax Europeana, with Calisia and Germania as the central pillars of this new order.

That's why masses of people who seek nothing but a better life in prosperity are fleeing to us as a jewel in the crown of this ancient continent, instead of fighting for survival every day. And such is the daily reality for most citizens of Baltia, Ruthenia, Alba Ruthenia, Scythia, and many other distant lands all the way to the land of Sinae.\n\nThe eastern wall of the empire definitely needs reinforcement with human potential, and with the advancing Romanization, we don't have to worry about the assimilation of new arrivals; they will gladly compete among themselves for the right to be citizens of Calisia, thanks to the prestige that you, dear citizens, represent!"

Trade flourishes, and the specter of war has faded into oblivion as we opened our gates and welcomed everyone with open arms. A little empathy, and an enemy can become a friend.\n\nHowever, this does not mean a lack of military presence. Expansion of the limitanei guard is planned on the Eastern Limes, along with the establishment of appropriate refugee points. The outposts will be heavily manned to ensure the safety of all, not only citizens of Calisia, but also those who wish to become so. Limes Orientalis will be fortified!

Our legions bravely resist those who dared to attack us, repelling wave after wave.\n\nOur legates are among the greatest officers born of Mother Gaia, and thanks to their cunning and the indomitable spirit of our legionnaires, we will be able to crush enemy forces several times our size. One of the legates who commands the legions near Sedinum managed to sow discord between two minor Jutish tribes with just one well-fabricated rumor!

He is unworthy of any mercy, and every citizen who is able should slay him! A reward of five hundred thousand denarii is offered for his head!\n\nThe destruction wrought by these tribes can only be likened to the passage of a hurricane, and the stench they leave behind renders the land uninhabitable.

The battlefield looked terrible, the Huns decapitated the heads of the slain soldiers, and the luckier corpses had only their ears cut off.\n\nIt is not known what truly drives such cruel bloodlust, what motivations this man has besides absolute destruction.

It is our duty to bring them the torch of enlightenment and reintroduce them to our civilization.\n\nWe call upon our courageous citizens who are willing to embark on this noble endeavor, to join us in spearheading the settlement efforts in Podlachia.\n\nFor those who seek adventure, opportunity, and the chance to leave a lasting legacy, Podlachia beckons.

Our women!\n\nAttempts to bribe these plunderers are futile, as they simply return for more and more after receiving ransom.

By divine grace, the Franko-Saxon alliance is currently in doubt! After all, one does not need to be a brilliant scholar to see that the situation is heading towards the breaking of the alliance between these tribes.\n\nWhy did this happen, you may ask. Tragic news has “accidentally” emerged that the Saxon chieftain was cuckolded by the Frankish one! What's worse, this Saxon wife seemed terribly pleased at the prospect of using a younger and stronger male. Rumor has it that axes have been drawn.

Despite that, his dignified composure betrays that he thinks of himself as the real host of the great meeting in Urbs Calisia. True Primer inter Pares.

To ensure the army's compliance even after the possible passing of our great Legate, consul Cinastovicus ordered to send off some of his praetorians to oversee the military. They will serve with wise counsel and report any traitorous activity. This ensures that no Legion will try to rebel against the rightful rule of our consuls! This measure is of course only a temporary solution until the situation is stabilized and Popular menace is finally dealt with.

Their despicable behavior including defamation against our Limitanei will not stand! The suspected Barbarians will be kept in the camps near limites in order to determine, whether they are truly barbarians and where to send them. Our consuls are not cruel despots! They will ensure that each Barbarian is sent to the exact place where he came from. Despite their vile attack, we will not divide families!

His praetorians and frumentarii are formidable, but as you might expect from an elite unit, they are not numerous.

However, some misguided Legions were unaware of Calisius' madness and began to plunder and attack good Calisian citizens. Most of them are simple soldiers, unaware of the state-level complexities and intrigues. Their minds were unable to recognize Populares' lies as an evil demagogy! The consuls just want to punish the scheming traitors and every sane person can see those legionaries are not ones to blame. The lives of good Calisians are dear to magnimonious Cinastivicus and Caletus. That is why they send emissaries who are going to convince the rogue legates to bow down before the new rule of tradition!

Surely paid by the foreign empires. If you want the well-deserved bounties, come to Optimates' bosom. Under the wise rule of consuls, you will receive all those things! Soldiers of the so-called 'rogue legions' that will swear fealty to the new rule will receive swaths of lands full of fertile soil in Subcarpathia and wealthy villages in Venedia Minor.

As of now, he has not yet responded to the invitation of the consul to discuss the future of Calisia. Ever prudent, he must have been unsure whether the new consuls were able to save our Empire. All of us can act as witnesses that their joined rule has passed the test of time. The Legate sees it as well, as as of now, he is heading to the capital with his Legions, ready to cooperate with the civil powers to reach consensus for the benefit of all Calisians!

The wise men determined that such a turn of events was caused by the old age and Popular propaganda being whispered in his ear. It is also possible that Populares has been feeding our Emperor with hallucinogenics to induce madness in his mind! Unfortunately, the Consuls' hands have been forced by the evil machinations of their enemies. However, we finally have a legal act showing that the execution of poor, misguided Calisius was indeed justified. Even fanatically loyal Marcus Vinicius admitted the righteousness of the consuls' action. Now our great leaders are debating when to rule the new elections!

They reached an agreement with Marcus Vinicius and the three of them declared themselves the Triumvirs of Calisia dedicated to the preservation of the Republic. From now on Calisia will be divided into three parts to govern them more efficiently! Each Triumvir will govern in an almost independent manner. Each of them will govern their lands as they see fit. Each will implement the reforms they think are the best. Such competition of system will help them determine the best course of action when the Empire finally unifies as well as prevent civil wars dictated by the lack of consensus about internal policy.

calisia.2.t: "Behind the Purple Curtains"
calisia.2.desc: " - What will the Emperor do now? - Conradus, one of the royal servants, unable to cope with the lingering stress, burst out.\n - I heard he plans to reform the system of public land - his colleague tried to ease his companion's worries.\n - Oh Kacper, don't be ridic... - despite the distress, he managed to refrain from saying something that could offend the Emperor. No one knew who could overhear them. - I mean, why would he?\n - Why, he was the one who curtailed the corrupt clergy and took their land. - Caspar backed up his case - He cares for the poor.\n - But redistributing it to the masses - Conradus tried to be much more careful with his words now - That would contradict his previous actions. He used those lands to appease the soldiers and the financial elite.\n\nThe conversation continued for some time, and just as Caspar feared, someone was indeed spying on them and many other servants. Imperator Ricardus Calisius ordered his agents to overhear the rumors surrounding him. To find any traces of a conspiracy and... to satisfy his ego. The Dominus bathed in the attention he was getting from the servants, soldiers, and senators alike. All unsure about his next move. However, the light of the imperial glory cannot outshine the burning flame of corruption that began to slowly consume his domain. Something meaningful had to be done. \nSomething inside him yearned for drastic actions to help the poor masses. A memory etched beyond the edge of his mind. A memory of the red and gold standards of a bygone empire, but not of the old Rome. Something more recent. Something he knew more... intimately. \nCalisius took a sip of his favorite Lazio wine to calm his troubled mind. Whatever noble intentions he may have had, he has long since realized that the wealthy senators were the ones financing his state and providing economic progress. Still, the excesses of the corrupt quaestors had to be stopped, even if he needed to take the side of the patricians in the brewing conflict to accomplish it. \nOne thing was certain - he had to break the silence and implement reforms, either revolutionary or evolutionary, to the Ager Publicus system. His postponement of the matter has raised the tension and expectations so high, even the gods on Olympus were aware of them. He'll have to deliver a speech great enough to meet those expectations."

We've cut out half the east wall specifically for this! \n- ...oh Jesus-Christ-Jupiter just... go. Begone. Thanks. \n- O- o-o-of-of-of course. Ave Calisius... \n\nThe emperor was tired of this whole mess already. For the past 3 hours he's been listening to the panic and stutter of ashamed senators who failed to fit in the ceremony's theme, and his bum was really starting to hurt from sitting in the same position for all this time. \nThe fools who already laid their gifts in front of him also weren't helping - they've clumped themselves together in one of the hall's corners and were now bickering between each other about their incompetence and lack of organization. Some of them came to the ceremony with birthday cups and hats, others packed their gifts like Christmas presents, and some were even ostentatiously throwing themselves at the emperor's feet. And they were doing it the wrong way, too - as if he was a pharaoh, not an Augustus. \n\nAll, however, were beaten in their idiocy by certain two stooges: the one who decided to enter the hall in *great style*, whom the emperor've just dismissed after the Scoda Superbus meant as a gift to him failed to fit in the specially prepared hole in the room's wall, nearly robbing the Tłokinia Palace off of its restaurant wing's roof, and Jakub - previously a student, nowadays Calisius' personal aide (or maid, rather), who risked getting trampled to death by a crowd of senators and their guards leaving the hall just to present his ruler with a toaster. A fucking *toaster*. \n\nThe paralympics in sucking up to the emperor lasted for another hour or two, until the last senator promptly stormed out of the building after bestowing the throne with a pair of anti-slip socks and an Angry Birds-themed bedding set. Finally - the palace was emptied of any civil servants, a small wave of servants flooding the building's rooms in their stead. Immedeatly, Calisius himself started manually delegating them to various tasks in a tired, irritated voice. \n- You. Get a brush and tidy the shelves. You, you and you - deal with shit on the tables. You three will handle the floor. You! Call whatever builders still working at this time of the day and tell 'em to patch up the goddamn wall, and *YOU*, Jakub..."

Hehe.\n - Get out! - Kompa saw through the lies of the emissary. - Had it not been for the avalanche of work I had to do, I'd have gone there myself and done it properly.\nIndeed, as a qualified historian of late antiquity, Kompa was the perfect candidate to navigate the meanders of courtly etiquette. Even though he mainly specialized in the Byzantine history.\n - At this point, we'll never convince Calisius to implement our plans - Lamented Hevodorukus.\n - Your plans, you mean? - Kompa thought to himself.\nWhile all of the Populares wanted to ease the pain of the poor and democratize the Empire, Hevodorukus was one of the more radical members. He wanted for the workers' syndicates or sodalitates and collegia to be the main form of economic organization.\n - Thank God... or gods, I'm here to temper him - Kompa congratulated himself in his mind. Truth be told together they were quite a political powerhouse with Hevodorukus coming up with the reform programs and Kompa selling them to the Emperor wrapped in the authentic Roman terminology.\nWhile the duo shined at the court, as the intellectuals and outsiders they met certain difficulties while dealing with the supposed backbone of their movement, the lower classes. Of course, they liked their noble, academic presence, but direct interactions were usually quite awkward. That's why they had the men for the dirty work. When they needed to appease a local mayor they usually sent someone like Silvius Iacobinus, an elder of Ferrerum to visit him with alcohol et ecce, you've got a mayor on your side. However, even Iacobinus can't be everywhere and drink alcohol with all of the imperial subjects (despite what he claims). That's why someone like the leader of the legionaries, Marcus Vinicius would be a great asset to Populares' cause. Would be, as, despite his formal allegiance to the faction, he cares little for it, preferring to focus on his service to the Emperor, while remaining apolitical.\n - OK, the show's over! - ruled Kompa - Everyone, get back to work. If the Optimates faces the same problem as we do, our government may yet hold to power."

And he worked for less than minimal wage. \n– Enough with the talk. Show me your projects! – Calisius commanded. \nA few bills were set before him. On averse, there was the usual profile of emperor, on the reverse – the depictions of Legion’s crossing the Prosna on a makeshift bridge, capturing a tank or fighting barbarians. \n– Is that a German? Beaten on the helmet? Timeless classic. I’m sure the men will appreciate these. \n– Oh Emperor! You honor me, but please, reconsider whom you will reward. Those legionaries are dirty scoundrels, and their Vinicius is a good-for-nothing. Don’t let those bills fall into their dirty hands; they’ll squander them in one day. The pretorians, on the other hand, would-  \n– I know full well I’ll see this money once in my life and never again. The true problem is the feast for whoever gets the donativum. \n– You mean, oh divine? \n– The legionaries would prolly appreciate a whole load of huge, cheap Polish-style pizza. Greasy, thick, with a shitload of cheese. Plus a ton of cheap wine. Jabol, even. I’m not sure if this is what we want to strive for. Bread, circus and orgy all day long – Kalisz sighed. – Meanwhile, the pretorians would expect an actual Napoletana, and while I do enjoy a good Napoletana, it’s a bit on the nose. These men are thugs, first and foremost, and they won’t distinguish a good Umbrian wine from Żabka’s Fresco. They just want wealth, and with it, power. \n\nThe emperor grabbed a bill to wipe out sweat from his forehead. No matter whom he would choose..."

calisia.10.t: "The Price of Loyalty"
calisia.10.desc: "Throughout the night, a place normally shrouded in secrecy erupted into multiple rounds of cheers and laughter. The barracks barely resembled their usual self, upscaled into a lavish, albeit impromptu dining hall. Still, all the forced decorum and self-aggrandizement of the late soirée could barely conceal the true brutishness of Calisia's upstart elite guard. With each swig of the finest local red, the carefully crafted mannerisms that allowed the praetorians to brush shoulders with the Emperor himself clashed with their plebeian nature, slowly devolving the meeting into a feast only Bacchus would look favorably upon. \n\nFrom among the dozen voices of high-ranking officers trying to shout over one another in their drunken stream of consciousness, the center of attention slowly shifted toward the central figure of the pack, still clad in his full suit of armor. Christianus Cinastovicus might not seem like the most imposing figure, yet the regal purple adorning his figure exuded a whole different aura - prestige, and authority. When he raised his cup into the air, the chatter immediately quieted down. \n\n- Enjoy yourselves tonight, men, for our drinks are paid from the Emperor's coffers! Ave Calisius! - an agreeing cheer followed the words. The praetorians needed no encouragement to empty another round, but knowing it was their sovereign's Denarius sponsoring the feast made the wine taste even sweeter. \n- His Highness finally decided to reward our exemplary service with a nice little bonus. Guess protection has a steep price when you're the most hated man in Calisia. - he snarkily continued. \n- Oh please. The old sod's gonna have his heart give out long before anyone could actually strike at him. - a jolly guard interrupted, forgetting himself amid the drunken conversation. \n- That 'old sod' is your only path to a paycheck, Gaius. And your only chance at actual relevancy. You better pray he lives long enough for you to earn yourself a comfortable pension. \n- And what if our beloved Emperor ever grows stingy with his protection money, Christianus? \nThe praetorian leader smiled in mutual understanding. \n- Oh, it's quite simple..."

calisia.11.t: "Kebabus Europae"
calisia.11.desc: "This was the focal point. One of many, but perhaps the most notorious. You wouldn’t go there if you weren’t ripe enough, with wine – and arms. Not after dark. The men picked fight about everything. Games, bitches, politics, past and future – you name it. They were worse than their fathers and brothers; the young men who came before. More drunk, more belligerent. Actually convinced about their impunity. That is, until they’ve started being whipped in the barracks. \n\nNonetheless, the old man looked on them with little fear or resentment. It’s true, some of them did not consider a ‘kebab’ something worth spending their salarium on. There was no arguing with them; just a quick nod to the cohortes urbanae, when they arrived to pick this night’s offenders. However, majority of guests were drunk and magnanimous enough to leave more pennies than necessary, just to show off. It would seem respect for the man behind the counter weighted more than esteem among one’s comrades. \n\nAs drunk legionaries were knocked down by either clubs or alcohol, old Turk thought to himself that this masquerade was somewhat... enjoyable. Everyone had to play his part, and his was fairly easy: no one knew how a ‘Roman kebab’ was supposed to be like, so he could improvise. But the clients, especially the legionaries, acted different. True, they were a bunch of aggresive, drunk and probably racist young men with need to knock someone up or down – just like before. But this time, they had a purpose. They wanted to fight for the city. To protect it. Maybe just because they were paid better now and then.\n\nOr maybe because they actually begun to care. \n\nThe owner shrugged, soaked the mop and started wiping vomit, blood and sauce from the floor. Another night came to an end."

calisia.13.desc: "Another gathering of the Senate, another few hours of listening to other Senators speak with audibly forced eloquence about the need to make a dog park somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Normally Consul Andreas Kompa would be bored out of his mind, dozing off, exchanging glares with some optimates, or simply chatting with other senators to either of his sides, however today he had no time for meaningless chatter. In fact, he didn’t have much time for anything, as he sat there stressfully clenching a small file of papers in his hands. Kompa was given the dubious honor of delivering a speech that could either kickstart, or kill the idea of reforming the Ager Publicus on arrival. Time flew by him, and soon enough it was finally his time to speak before his colleagues. He stood up and with the weight of the world crashing down upon his shoulders, stepped up to the podium. \n\n- The issue that I will be talking about today is one of grave importance. I speak today not as a populares, but instead as a senator concerned with the current ongoing crisis. As I assume you all know, recent findings have uncovered many inefficiencies and flaws in the system of Ager Publicus. Plebes working the lands of certain patricians and even some senators have been found to be exploited, overworked and unfairly rewarded for their labor. On top of that, cases of tax reports meant to fund the Res Publica being falsified have also been uncovered.\n\nMurmurs spread through the Senate hall, each quiet on their own, but gathering into a deafening clamor. The loudest and seemingly most concerned of the whispers spread from the seats occupied by the optimates. Before the noise could grow any louder, Kompa cleared his throat, returning the hall’s attention back to himself. As he continued to speak, he locked eyes with one man in particular: Petrus Caletus, the unofficial leader of the optimates.\n\n- A glaring problem within this whole ordeal is the inexcusable behavior of the optimates. Ever since the news of overreaches within the Ager Publicus have been brought to light, they haven’t done as much as lifted a finger in the way of fixing this problem. These actions speak louder than words and every Calisian will be well aware of their inaction. It’s really not surprising seeing them in this position; most cases of corruption and exploitation to varying degrees have been noted in properties owned directly, or indirectly by members of the optimates.\n\nKompa couldn’t help but feel accomplished, seeing the face of Consul Caletus drop from a veneer of confidence to a grimace of poorly bottled up rage. Murmurs once again drowned out any other noise within the hall, this time interspersed with chuckles from the side of the populares. This time, the murmurs dispersed on their own after a short while, letting the Consul continue unimpeded.\n\n- However, members of the populares are not guilt-free. Despite what some in this hall may think, this is not a reason to squabble amongst each other. Ager Publicus is flawed and we, as humble servants of the Res Publica must work to fix it. The fact of the matter is however, that reform..."

Some of the men had Andean style caps; the kind of which, in better times, was associated with then-prime minister Tusk. Others sported makeshift helmets and silvery fishscale overalls, which – apparently – were supposed to resemble lamellar armour. \n– You bunch of barbarian maggots ever heard of thermae or razors? – the prefect asked. \n– With all due respect, good sire – the horsemen leader rode forward – we were not keen on losing our identity, and our considerable facial hair, under new government. But, well, as we were recognised as equites of the empire, we, uh, found ourselves in need to adapt. We are still Sarmatians, only the ancient kind. The real one, if you prefer, good sire. \n\nThe silence was as uncomfortable as lamellar overalls. After a longer while, a young optio broke out. \n– Quintus... Quintus, don’t irritate yourself... \n– How I’m supposed not to irritate? \n– Easy, they’ll latinize... \n– They won’t latinize! Nothing will latinize! I won’t get another equites like that! We were supposed to recruit a good bunch of horsemen and not some steppe throatsinger wannabies! I bet they can’t even do Parthian shot! \n\nAs on command, a few arrows flew towards the Roman delegation.

The gates of palace was shut, and in each window, a rifleman waited for the command to open fire. \n\nRumour had it a whole legion was sent to capture the estates. How fitting that the Lechite monarchy was to be ended by its eternal Roman enemies! Or maybe not, the count thought. The cause of the Lechites would be taken up by another warlord elsewhere in Poland. There’s no need to be dramatic about it. \n\nAs Leszczyński walked through the halls of his palace, he noticed the portrait of his great ancestor, king of Poland, great duke of Lithuania, prince of Lotharingia Stanisław Leszczyński. His deeds and struggles imbued him with inspiration. The count stopped for a while and pondered. What would Leszczyński do? \n\nAnd so, Wojciech Edward I Leszczyński bailed the fuck out of his palace and escaped to France."

Morning air was cold, and grey sky weighted heavily over moribund silence of the village. Two decurions stepped out into a post-postapocalyptic environment and navigated towards the municipal building, where fresh recruits were supposedly „stashed” for transport towards the legio’s castrum. \n – I hope it doesn’t stink in the- BY JOVE IT’S GONE FULL BARBARIC – officer shouted as loud as he could with his nose and mouth covered.

Regular, proper camp, although with no walls, ditches or alert guards, and certainly without latrines. Inside each tent, fresh legionaries were carefully tucked in, still sleeping soundly.

Mixed up fantasies about past and future mangled the minds of men and made the most outrageous outcomes a desirable possibility. Their brunt, physical consequences were skimmed off as flashy display of B-class movie action and pulp fiction tragedy. n\nOnce Poland experienced the Fall, a faint thought appeared in the minds of people of East and West alike, that contrary to a popular saying * something * might indeed happen, and that end of world as it was known was an actual possibility. Once Germany and Russia embroiled themselves in internal strife and civil war, this thought was widely acknowledged. One day people did not simply wake up, but persisted instead in a fever dream, where everything was possible, as long as it kept the stream of consciousness running. \n\nAs waves of refugees moved into Polish successor state known as Calisia, they found themselves in a place somewhat safer, but by far more bizarre. It seemed as a form of coping mechanism, therapy or mass escapism. It did seem helpful – to an extent – but it wasn’t for the refugees. These were aliens, numerous, noisy and downtrodden, disturbing hard-fought peace – and the coping mechanism found a way to cope with that as well.

The right side of the hall murmured. \n– This is some Gypsyesque extravaganza! We don’t need styrofoam marble to build insulae for the plebeians! Did you even study Roman archi... \n– Mind your tone, Cinastovicus – Calisius quipped. – You cannot deny that public housing is a matter of utmost importance. \n– Quite unlike this „palace quarter” – Hevodorukus added. – This pointless display of wealth will turn against us if we’ll lack a single penny to spare for those in need. \n\nChaos erupted. Calisius rose from his chair and bellowed, like he used to in the old parlament. \n– Calm yourselves! We have undertaken those projects, so we shall bring them to an end. Rapienda rebus in malis praeceps via est! We shall embrace austerity in social spending, lest we neglect more cardinal matters, \nLegionaries and pretorians did not speak a word. Somehow, this was more unsettling than previous commotion. \n\n– It won’t be enough. Someone will have to carry the burden of sacrifice – Kompa remarked. \n– This is the time for patricians to prove they’re Calisian patriots. Let them defend their own interests. \n– The patricians supported the masses for long enough. Meanwhile we have plenty of barbarians not grateful enough for their privilege of staying in more civilized lands. Why shouldn’t we squeeze them first before moving to proper Romans? \n\nThe outlook is clear, Calisius thought. Now, it all boils down to what Senate will be more willing to accept... and for what price."

calisia.57.desc: "– Marcus Vinicius came to visit you – a voice broke through a calm sound of flowing water. Calisius wiped his glasses from steam. A man in legionary armor walked through his private thermae towards tepidarium, where he currently lounged. \n– Ave, Caesar. May all gods grant you fortune, especially Asclepius and Cipride. \nThe emperor grumbled. – Of all the gods, why would you think I need Cypride the most? Do I look like an amorous man? – he rose from the pool, extending his arms as to present the nuda veritas of his outward appearance. – Don’t you feel like we’ve had this exact conversation before? \n– My apologies, o emperor. This was like... an involuntary reaction to this situation. I could really use a longer stay in the termae myself. \n – Oh Marcus, you know you can use my thermae whenever you need – Calisius gave him a wry smile. \n– You’re as gracious as ever, my emperor. – Vinicius bowed sharply. – Forgive me, for I have to refuse. I’m entirely overtaken by military matters. \n– Surely you could lend your duties to your assistants for some time. \n– It is not possible. All officers are constantly occupied. We’re understaffed on all lines, and men are taking leaves en masse. They don’t want to stay in camp on meagre pay while they could work at home. \n– It would be wiser for them to stay on the frontlines. – Calisius nodded and two servants rushed with a sizeable towel. The emperor climbed out of the pool and draped himself like he would in a toga. – How much would it take to keep more of them at arms? \n– It’s the fault of the system, my emperor. Our army is designed to be mobilised in full only during the season most appropriate for campaings. Once it has ended, most of the men ought to go back to the job marked or fieldwork, lest we ruin our economy. \n– You know full well we have to work with what we got. But I suppose we could pay less men full time for their better performance. \n– We could make the legions into a professional force. However, I’m afraid this would create a professional caste of warriors, separate from the rest of our citizens. \n– If you have an alternative in mind to an professional army, voice your opinion – Calisius said drily. \n– We could enroll more non-citizens as auxiliary troops. Allow them to defend Calisia like it was their homeland. This would give them a chance to improve their lot, and, perhaps, foster some loyalty. \nEmperor gestured vaguely, as if thinking of an argument."
calisia.57.a: "I'll think about it in the frigidarium."

calisia.58.t: "Conversatio Privata"
calisia.58.desc: "The office was dimmed, and Cinastovicus’ eyes took a while to adapt to the darkness. Calisius sat there alone, elbows on desk, fingers intertwined, thumbs holding up forehead. He had a laurel on his head – which seemed overly theatrical, even for someone like him. \n– Ave, emperor. You’ve requested for a private conference with me. \n– Sit down, Kinastowski – Calisius gestured to the chair in front of the desk. It was an ordinary office chair, as normal as could be. As he sat, the pretorian realised the room was completely unromanised – which only made the sight of emperor’s toga and his armor somewhat uncomfortable. \n– You are aware of the newest reports, right? – Calisius asked. \n– Of course, my emperor. I’ve mobilised the pretorian guard, they’re ready to march at on.. . \n– I wouldn’t call you here just to brief you on obviousness. I’m asking you whether you are aware what is happening. \n– I beg your pardon, sire... \n– If someone five years ago would tell you there’s a slave rebellion happening just an hour drive from your home, what would you do? \n– I was always against terrorism and acts of violence targeted at... \n– No. A * slave * rebellion. Think about it, Kinastowski. We have *slaves and now they are *killing landowners. You would think I lost my mind if I implied it could happen here, and not in some sort of Bantustan or whatever. \nThat’s it, Cinastovicus thought. He’s actually losing his mind. An impulsive grin appeared on the pretorian’s face, but he collected himself at a blink of an eye. – You must be joking, my emperor. You’re the one who had shown us the way to our current glorious... \n– I did not show the way for an accursed slave rebellion! – Calisius erupted, slamming his fist on the shamble desk. – Who do you think I am? A slave driver for your petty friends to get fat out of this miserable land? This madness has to be fini... – he paused for a while, breathing heavily, adjusting his glasses and, curtly, his laurel. – This has to be corrected. Populares are calling for abolishing slavery as it is now. I think it’s quite sensible as it is. You can surely acknowledge that it’s better to have an indentured servant that a slave that’s ready to cut your throat. \n– My apologies, oh divine emperor, but now it is too late. These are barbarians; it’s in their nature to cut throats. You don’t extend a hand to a beast that wants to bite you. Slaves will know their place... – „or you won’t have yours”, Cinastivicus ended in mind. \n– Thankfully you’re not the one who’s making all the decisions here. Order pretorians to stand easy, for now. "

calisia.73.desc: "- Just stick to the plan and everything will go smoothly. Alright, let's move out. \n\nThe job was simple: sneak up through the treeline, watch out for any threats and get out with as many captured women as possible. Then, pack ''the loot'' onto the trucks waiting in the forest and get away from there before any resistance shows up. \nThe targets were in the border settlement of Bycz, located near the pre-Fall border between Kuyavia and Greater Poland. \n\nAt first, it seemed like the Amazonians abandoned the village: no armed personnel was in sight, the closest signs of enemy activity being located almost a kilometer away, at the small checkpoint set up in Wyrobki. After the drone operator made sure noone was watching them, the men surrounded the village and simultaneously broke into the first few buildings, with the intent of giving the victims the least time to reacWATCH OUT, MINE! \n\nIn a moment, the entire group was thrown onto the ground by an explosion that ripped away half of plot #30. Immedeatly after, an entire company of soldieresses jumped the group from two sides and disarmed it in a matter of seconds. Soon after, the invaders were taken to the local fire station, rounded up, knocked out and stuffed into InPost vans awaiting them in the garages. \n\n...\n\nNorthern Calisian borderlands, early in the morning. The local garrison's commander has just woken up, teeming with excitement. His boys must have just returned with the targets! Oh, how delightful!... this calls for a celebration! \n\nThe man got up, put on his comfy clothes, grabbed his wallet and ventured outside, towards the local Dino. Hmm... will it be a couple beers? No, it must be something fancier. OH! How about some rum? Rum with morning coffee sounds nice. Or how about a nice wine? After all, we're Romans now, right? \nAnd so, the jolly commander marched on, wondering to himself what should he pick. As he reached the market's parking, his thoughts lingered around the liquor shelf for a moment. \n\nThat's also where he found his platoon. \n\nLying unconscious in their underpants, heads stuffed into the parking's Paczkomat."

Through skillfully swaying the local political figures he had managed to become a major contender in the region through semi-modernized Roman reforms. An army of Legionnaires, coinage with the Emperor’s facade and new marble buildings soon to be constructed in recently romanized cities really give off a look of being brought back to the distant past. It remains to be seen what will arise from this state of pseudo-Roman reenactors, though it goes without saying that even if their folly is to end, the Polish-Roman state will no doubt go down in history as another in a long list of oddities resulting from the Fall."

POLITICS_RICARDUS_CALISIUS_DESC: "A former socialist, lawyer, politician – hardly the most respectable Cursus Honorum, although a typical one. For all of his life, Ryszard Kalisz felt some kind of yearning in the back of his mind. He could feel it while walking past the columns of the Supreme Court, inscribed with ancient legal maxims, watching Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra, or even just eating pizza. Whenever he held a speech, be it in court or in Sejm, he could feel the presence of someone far greater and wiser than the jury or the Marshal of the Sejm behind him. Back then, he would simply dismiss it and carry on. \n\nIt was right after the Fall his inner consciousness had awoken. Running away (either from the blast or the angered mob), he hid in a wine cellar in Kalisz. Whatever happened there will be forever shrouded in mystery. On the third day, he emerged, draped in a bedsheet tinted purple with Lazio wine, with a golden laurel on his head and perfect knowledge of all five Latin declensions. \n\nHowever odd Kalisz wouldn’t seem, the locals did greatly appreciate his restlessness and organizational talent. No one batted an eye when he ordered officials to wear togas or enforced Latin nomenclature. However, when he proclaimed himself the descendant of Jupiter, some people thought he might be going too far. By then, however, his rule had already been cemented. Kalisz approached members of local elites and offered them an attractive deal: land in exchange for political power. Soon afterward, the Senate convened and proclaimed Kalisz – now Ricardus Calisius – first, a consul for life and, soon after – the emperor of Calisia. The new dictator’s first edict shocked many to the bone: he reinstituted a form of indentured servitude, which turned out to be little more than thinly veiled slavery. \n\nCalisius walks a tightrope between the Optimates, which aim to seize as much wealth and power as possible, and the Populares, who point out the crying inequality in the nascent empire. The conflict is amplified by the uncertainty surrounding Calisius’ mental state. As mad as he seems, he did manage to reforge this piece of post-Fall Poland into a strong, well-functioning statelet. His past made many think he’d turn out to be an opportunist, but his decision to uphold democratic traditions by empowering the Senate proved he is just as much a Cincinnatus as an Augustus. The true extent of the Emperor’s ambition – or folly – will soon be unraveled..."
POLITICS_pawel_delag_DESC: "Once upon a time an actor named Paweł Deląg played a bad-boy-turned-good-guy Marcus Vinicius in a grandiose ancient Rome epic called Quo Vadis. Thus he earned a certain fame and reputation as „Poland sexiest actor of 2001”, while helping shape the image of a gory, immoral Roman Empire transforming into a more humane, Christian Europe. \n\nThat’s perhaps why Deląg, as soon as atomic dust settled, moved where ruins were modern and reconstruction was ancient.\n\nIt’s hard to assume whether he offered his service to Calisius out of conviction, lust for power or pure opportunism, or was simply bought. Nonetheless, placed at the helm of the legions, he quickly became the icon of the regime, most likely because he was the one who truly seemed like he was the right man in the right place. The people listen to his words, and the affection with which legionaries follow him would be hard to outweigh with money. Magnanimous, outgoing and tolerant, Vinicius quickly became a leader of the popular faction, believing that the new Eternal City can be a place where everyone can be a citizen of equal rights and duties; where bread and circuses serve a better purpose than controlling the masses. \n\nMarcus’ charm and popularity act like a column holding Calisius’ regime standing. It would seem the emperor’s past makes him sympathetic to popular ideas. The caesar could not think of a better friend... But can a friendship last forever?"
