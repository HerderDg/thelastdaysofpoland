The unruly Scythians, undoubtedly rallied by their former nobles, have risen against our rule killing Calisians mercilessly. No one may feel safe as the barbarians kill both the hardworking plebian settlers, but also the illustrious patricians. Both men and women and even the children fall victim to their spears as those horse-riding monsters know no mercy. The might Calisius has sent his faithful legions to the region to punish the rebels.

The servants will be protected by Calisian law, which will force the patricians to uphold their part of the contract. Calisius hopes that in the future this institution will be the backbone of the imperial economy.

Henceforth, to protect Calisian citizens and ensure the stability of our empire, the vast majority of the primitive peoples that we will conquer in the future... WILL! BE! ENSLAVED!

Soon, important matters of state will be discussed, along with the Senate’s usual duties. Citizens are once again welcome to send letters with matters they see as important enough to discuss. Mail meant to demean or poke fun at the Senate, will be punished with a fine of 50 Calisian denarii. Talks of arguments or violent confrontations within the Senate halls are nothing but hearsay and baseless lies. The Emperor guarantees that all bodies of the Res Publica are dignified and untarnished places of nothing but diligent work, with no troublemakers, or bullies."

Elections for the seats will be held in exactly two weeks from this day. Citizens who wish to partake in the democratic process, can vote at the nearest polling station. Addresses of said locations will be announced a week before the election date. The glorious title of Senator comes with many benefits, including lodging in the luxurious senatorial villas, as soon as one becomes available."

CAL_lex_indentatae_servitutis: "Lex Indentatae Servitutis"
CAL_lex_indentatae_servitutis_desc: "The question of slavery raised during the Senate's ongoing session! Following the tragic events in Rawicz, a handful of Populares have occupied the rostrum, demanding an immediate end to Calisia's system of forced labor! After a long spat, the factions have agreed to put the matter to a vote, resulting in a more moderate proposal by the reformers to transition to a temporary form of servitude with an option to buy out one's contract after a specified period of work. Concerned about the economic impact, the Optimates demand the labor to instead be performed by subservient populations, enshrining their status as Servi in return for the state providing them housing and appropriate sustenance. Large protests of barbarian groups have erupted in opposition to the proposal."

CAL_lex_militae: "Lex Militae"
CAL_lex_militae_desc: "Reinforcements for the army imminent as the Senate finalizes a new bill regarding conscription! In response to requests by Legate Vinicius and other high military commanders, the chamber has swiftly and collectively agreed to expand current conscription laws to ensure a larger force capable of supporting all theaters of war. After a promising start, the issue has bogged down around the matter of which groups should be included in the decree, with the Populares advocating for the founding of barbarian formations as a supplement for the current manpower issues. Claiming them to be untrustworthy and their loyalty to Calisia to be unclear, the Optimates vehemently oppose this idea, claiming that size can be sacrificed and that their smaller, professional army will be far more effective against external threats. While the factions remain polarized on the issue, the final shape of the bill will likely be decided by a handful of undecided senators, unless a passable compromise can be found."

CAL_lex_tributorum: "Lex Tributorum"
CAL_lex_tributorum_desc: "The solution to the Empire's financial woes drawing nearer! A consensus has been reached among all factions regarding the necessity of a tax reform, and plans have been introduced to the Senate by both parties highlighting the areas where further funds could be obtained for the treasury. True to their name, the Populares insist on an increased tax on the wealthy to not only fix the budgetary deficit but also ease the burden on the impoverished. Outraged at what they refer to as "an attack on those contributing the most to our shared prosperity," the Optimates have instead opted for increased financial obligations on barbarians residing within imperial territory, deemed a more-than-overdue repayment for the benefits they reap. Due to multiple factions and action groups weighing in on the issue, the deadlock is expected to continue for now."

CAL_lex_mercatoria: "Lex Mercatoria"
CAL_lex_mercatoria_desc: "The senatorial debate progresses! Senators have moved on to discuss the state's trade laws - topics expected to be undertaken by the Senate over the next days include export laws, export goods and the state and safety of Calisian trade routes. \n\nBusinessmen and freemen engaging in trade are adviced to closely follow the debate and the decisions undertaken by their politicians."

A heated discussion broke out between the Populares and Optimates as the Senate moves on to discuss the topic of social care and subsidies. Both sides radically oppose each other on the matter: the Populares postulate enriching and increasing the populace's social care, whereas the Optimates suggest cutting down on such expenditures to free up state resources and not risk the need to introduce new taxes. \n\nThose eligible for voting can track both sides' proposals on their respective websites. The Senate's progress appears to be halting due to the arising conflict between the Senators, and voters are adviced to exact pressure on their politicians to avert yet another political deadlock..."

The Senate has struck a final decision on the matter of social subsidies for Citizenry - now the Senators discuss social care for those living below the poverty line, seeking to cure the plague of homelessness and indigence caused by the Fall of Polonia. \n\nHomeless shelters, soup kitchens and financial support are among the programs proposed by either sides. Voters interested in aiding the poor are expected to voice their opinion on the matter."

Soon the best sons of Calisia will vote on the matter of the death penalty for the worst of crimes. The motion to introduce poenae capitalis to our realm has been issued by the Optimates. They say the the most vile of criminals should die a painful death for their transgressions, in public might I add. Despite the rumors only a slight minority of Optimates supports crucifixion and this method of execution will not find itself in the official act. As always, they are opposed by the Populares, who are of the opinion that if we can in time civilize the barbarians then we should succeed at civilizing the bandits, especially since some of them are native Calisians."

CAL_lex_iuononis: "Lex Iunonis"
CAL_lex_iuononis_desc: "Decisive actions by the Senate regarding the status of women in the empire! A heated debate rages on between the factions, with two separate legislations introduced. The delegation of the Populares has promised radical reforms, fully granting female citizens all legal rights and protections, including a total ban on the mistreatment and non-consensual capture of female barbarians. A counter-proposal has been introduced by the Optimates, promising increased rights, but emphasizing the importance of traditional roles, and vowing to extend protections only to those bound by Calisian law. Voting on the matter is expected to be concluded within the coming month."

CAL_lex_civitatis_desc: "Changes to the citizenship acquisition process imminent! Recognizing the need for reform, the Senate has begun deliberations on a new bill that will widen existing paths for one to be officially recognized as Calisian. The Populares promise sweeping change, aiming to extend citizenship to anyone of sufficient status residing on the Empire's territory, should they prove their service to His Grace, Ricardus Calisius. The bipartisanship of this proposal has been rejected by the Optimates, who instead advocate for a one-time financial tribute, equal to the monthly upkeep of a maniple. All affected are asked to refrain from displays of support for their preferred option, so as to not influence the natural course of the debate."

CAL_lex_acculturationis: "Lex Acculturationis"
CAL_lex_acculturationis_desc: "Dear citizens! At the personal request of the Emperor, as a result of our growing territory and constant increase in non-Calisian subjects, the Senate has agreed to consider the issue of whether barbarian-born individuals can truly be inducted into our superior culture. As per the statement of the Populares, 'to be Calisian is a matter not of birth, but rather a result of embracing our common values.' Senators loyal to the faction wish to secure funding for extensive cultural programs to enlighten the subjugated populations. In response, the Optimates postulate that certain groups are inherently barbaric, and to teach them our ways would merely be a waste of resources. \n\nCitizens are welcome to voice their opinions on the matter. A poll will be conducted shortly, asking whether residents of the Eternal City would be comfortable considering a person of barbarian origin as a fellow Calisian."

CAL_lex_amoris_liberi: "Lex Amoris Liberi"
CAL_lex_amoris_liberi_desc: "Rights for same-sex couples on the agenda for the upcoming Senate session!

But now, with the arrival of Calisian legions, Ruthenia Rubra once again stands at the forefront among our provinces!\n\nNew settlers are needed! The main direction of settlement will be the city of Sanocum, which has been completely deserted for years due to wars, Scythian bandit raids, and persecutions. The Department of Colonies is ready to pay generous bonuses for taking control of the lands in that region! Consider it well, it's a chance for a fresh start, free of any Scythians and bandits."

Unfortunately, the sad streets of the province's capital remind us of the cruel pogrom that occurred after the outbreak of the crisis. Several thousand citizens of Calisia were brutally murdered by the executioners, mainly of Ruthenian nationality. Their bodies were nailed to crosses to the delight of the crowd in a "reminiscent of an eagle" position.\n\nOur soldiers repaid the executioners in kind. The capital of Borussia was left deserted, with those who did not flee becoming collateral damage. It’s a sad reality, but justice had to be served by the stern hand of a Calisian soldier. Otherwise, they might again get some notions of murder and treachery."

calisia.2.desc: " - What will the Emperor do now? - Conradus, one of the royal servants, unable to cope with the lingering stress, burst out.\n - I heard he plans to reform the system of public land - his colleague tried to ease his companion's worries.\n - Oh Kacper, don't be ridic... - despite the distress, he managed to refrain from saying something that could offend the Emperor. No one knew who could overhear them. - I mean, why would he?\n - Why, he was the one who curtailed the corrupt clergy and took their land. - Caspar backed up his case - He cares for the poor.\n - But redistributing it to the masses - Conradus tried to be much more careful with his words now - That would contradict his previous actions. He used those lands to appease the soldiers and the financial elite.\n\nThe conversation continued for some time, and just as Caspar feared, someone was indeed spying on them and many other servants. Imperator Ricardus Calisius ordered his agents to overhear the rumors surrounding him. To find any traces of a conspiracy and... to satisfy his ego. The Dominus bathed in the attention he was getting from the servants, soldiers, and senators alike. All unsure about his next move. However, the light of the imperial glory cannot outshine the burning flame of corruption that began to slowly consume his domain. Something meaningful had to be done. \nSomething inside him yearned for drastic actions to help the poor masses. A memory etched beyond the edge of his mind. A memory of the red and gold standards of a bygone empire, but not of the old Rome. Something more recent. Something he knew more... intimately. \nCalisius took a sip of his favorite Lazio wine to calm his troubled mind. Whatever noble intentions he may have had, he has long since realized that the wealthy senators were the ones financing his state and providing economic progress. Still, the excesses of the corrupt quaestors had to be stopped, even if he needed to take the side of the patricians in the brewing conflict to accomplish it. \nOne thing was certain - he had to break the silence and implement reforms, either revolutionary or evolutionary, to the Ager Publicus system. His postponement of the matter has raised the tension and expectations so high, even the gods on Olympus were aware of them. He'll have to deliver a speech great enough to meet those expectations."

We've cut out half the east wall specifically for this! \n- ...oh Jesus-Christ-Jupiter just... go. Begone. Thanks. \n- O- o-o-of-of-of course. Ave Calisius... \n\nThe emperor was tired of this whole mess already. For the past 3 hours he's been listening to the panic and stutter of ashamed senators who failed to fit in the ceremony's theme, and his bum was really starting to hurt from sitting in the same position for all this time. \nThe fools who already laid their gifts in front of him also weren't helping - they've clumped themselves together in one of the hall's corners and were now bickering between each other about their incompetence and lack of organization. Some of them came to the ceremony with birthday cups and hats, others packed their gifts like Christmas presents, and some were even ostentatiously throwing themselves at the emperor's feet. And they were doing it the wrong way, too - as if he was a pharaoh, not an Augustus. \n\nAll, however, were beaten in their idiocy by certain two stooges: the one who decided to enter the hall in *great style*, whom the emperor've just dismissed after the Scoda Superbus meant as a gift to him failed to fit in the specially prepared hole in the room's wall, nearly robbing the Tłokinia Palace off of its restaurant wing's roof, and Jakub - previously a student, nowadays Calisius' personal aide (or maid, rather), who risked getting trampled to death by a crowd of senators and their guards leaving the hall just to present his ruler with a toaster. A fucking *toaster*. \n\nThe paralympics in sucking up to the emperor lasted for another hour or two, until the last senator promptly stormed out of the building after bestowing the throne with a pair of anti-slip socks and an Angry Birds-themed bedding set. Finally - the palace was emptied of any civil servants, a small wave of servants flooding the building's rooms in their stead. Immedeatly, Calisius himself started manually delegating them to various tasks in a tired, irritated voice. \n- You. Get a brush and tidy the shelves. You, you and you - deal with shit on the tables. You three will handle the floor. You! Call whatever builders still working at this time of the day and tell 'em to patch up the goddamn wall, and *YOU*, Jakub..."

Hehe.\n - Get out! - Kompa saw through the lies of the emissary. - Had it not been for the avalanche of work I had to do, I'd have gone there myself and done it properly.\nIndeed, as a qualified historian of late antiquity, Kompa was the perfect candidate to navigate the meanders of courtly etiquette. Even though he mainly specialized in the Byzantine history.\n - At this point, we'll never convince Calisius to implement our plans - Lamented Hevodorukus.\n - Your plans, you mean? - Kompa thought to himself.\nWhile all of the Populares wanted to ease the pain of the poor and democratize the Empire, Hevodorukus was one of the more radical members. He wanted for the workers' syndicates or sodalitates and collegia to be the main form of economic organization.\n - Thank God... or gods, I'm here to temper him - Kompa congratulated himself in his mind. Truth be told together they were quite a political powerhouse with Hevodorukus coming up with the reform programs and Kompa selling them to the Emperor wrapped in the authentic Roman terminology.\nWhile the duo shined at the court, as the intellectuals and outsiders they met certain difficulties while dealing with the supposed backbone of their movement, the lower classes. Of course, they liked their noble, academic presence, but direct interactions were usually quite awkward. That's why they had the men for the dirty work. When they needed to appease a local mayor they usually sent someone like Silvius Iacobinus, an elder of Ferrerum to visit him with alcohol et ecce, you've got a mayor on your side. However, even Iacobinus can't be everywhere and drink alcohol with all of the imperial subjects (despite what he claims). That's why someone like the leader of the legionaries, Marcus Vinicius would be a great asset to Populares' cause. Would be, as, despite his formal allegiance to the faction, he cares little for it, preferring to focus on his service to the Emperor, while remaining apolitical.\n - OK, the show's over! - ruled Kompa - Everyone, get back to work. If the Optimates faces the same problem as we do, our government may yet hold to power."

And he worked for less than minimal wage. \n– Enough with the talk. Show me your projects! – Calisius commanded. \nA few bills were set before him. On averse, there was the usual profile of emperor, on the reverse – the depictions of Legion’s crossing the Prosna on a makeshift bridge, capturing a tank or fighting barbarians. \n– Is that a German? Beaten on the helmet? Timeless classic. I’m sure the men will appreciate these. \n– Oh Emperor! You honor me, but please, reconsider whom you will reward. Those legionaries are dirty scoundrels, and their Vinicius is a good-for-nothing. Don’t let those bills fall into their dirty hands; they’ll squander them in one day. The pretorians, on the other hand, would-  \n– I know full well I’ll see this money once in my life and never again. The true problem is the feast for whoever gets the donativum. \n– You mean, oh divine? \n– The legionaries would prolly appreciate a whole load of huge, cheap Polish-style pizza. Greasy, thick, with a shitload of cheese. Plus a ton of cheap wine. Jabol, even. I’m not sure if this is what we want to strive for. Bread, circus and orgy all day long – Kalisz sighed. – Meanwhile, the pretorians would expect an actual Napoletana, and while I do enjoy a good Napoletana, it’s a bit on the nose. These men are thugs, first and foremost, and they won’t distinguish a good Umbrian wine from Żabka’s Fresco. They just want wealth, and with it, power. \n\nThe emperor grabbed a bill to wipe out sweat from his forehead. No matter whom he would choose..."

calisia.10.desc: "Throughout the night, a place normally shrouded in secrecy erupted into multiple rounds of cheers and laughter. The barracks barely resembled their usual self, upscaled into a lavish, albeit impromptu dining hall. Still, all the forced decorum and self-aggrandizement of the late soirée could barely conceal the true brutishness of Calisia's upstart elite guard. With each swig of the finest local red, the carefully crafted mannerisms that allowed the praetorians to brush shoulders with the Emperor himself clashed with their plebeian nature, slowly devolving the meeting into a feast only Bacchus would look favorably upon. \n\nFrom among the dozen voices of high-ranking officers trying to shout over one another in their drunken stream of consciousness, the center of attention slowly shifted toward the central figure of the pack, still clad in his full suit of armor. Christianus Cinastovicus might not seem like the most imposing figure, yet the regal purple adorning his figure exuded a whole different aura - prestige, and authority. When he raised his cup into the air, the chatter immediately quieted down. \n\n- Enjoy yourselves tonight, men, for our drinks are paid from the Emperor's coffers! Ave Calisius! - an agreeing cheer followed the words. The praetorians needed no encouragement to empty another round, but knowing it was their sovereign's Denarius sponsoring the feast made the wine taste even sweeter. \n- His Highness finally decided to reward our exemplary service with a nice little bonus. Guess protection has a steep price when you're the most hated man in Calisia. - he snarkily continued. \n- Oh please. The old sod's gonna have his heart give out long before anyone could actually strike at him. - a jolly guard interrupted, forgetting himself amid the drunken conversation. \n- That 'old sod' is your only path to a paycheck, Gaius. And your only chance at actual relevancy. You better pray he lives long enough for you to earn yourself a comfortable pension. \n- And what if our beloved Emperor ever grows stingy with his protection money, Christianus? \nThe praetorian leader smiled in mutual understanding. \n- Oh, it's quite simple..."

The men picked fight about everything. Games, bitches, politics, past and future – you name it. They were worse than their fathers and brothers; the young men who came before. More drunk, more belligerent. Actually convinced about their impunity. That is, until they’ve started being whipped in the barracks. \n\nNonetheless, the old man looked on them with little fear or resentment. It’s true, some of them did not consider a ‘kebab’ something worth spending their salarium on. There was no arguing with them; just a quick nod to the cohortes urbanae, when they arrived to pick this night’s offenders. However, majority of guests were drunk and magnanimous enough to leave more pennies than necessary, just to show off. It would seem respect for the man behind the counter weighted more than esteem among one’s comrades. \n\nAs drunk legionaries were knocked down by either clubs or alcohol, old Turk thought to himself that this masquerade was somewhat... enjoyable. Everyone had to play his part, and his was fairly easy: no one knew how a ‘Roman kebab’ was supposed to be like, so he could improvise. But the clients, especially the legionaries, acted different. True, they were a bunch of aggresive, drunk and probably racist young men with need to knock someone up or down – just like before. But this time, they had a purpose. They wanted to fight for the city. To protect it. Maybe just because they were paid better now and then.\n\nOr maybe because they actually begun to care. \n\nThe owner shrugged, soaked the mop and started wiping vomit, blood and sauce from the floor. Another night came to an end."

calisia.13.desc: "Another gathering of the Senate, another few hours of listening to other Senators speak with audibly forced eloquence about the need to make a dog park somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Normally Consul Andreas Kompa would be bored out of his mind, dozing off, exchanging glares with some optimates, or simply chatting with other senators to either of his sides, however today he had no time for meaningless chatter. In fact, he didn’t have much time for anything, as he sat there stressfully clenching a small file of papers in his hands. Kompa was given the dubious honor of delivering a speech that could either kickstart, or kill the idea of reforming the Ager Publicus on arrival. Time flew by him, and soon enough it was finally his time to speak before his colleagues. He stood up and with the weight of the world crashing down upon his shoulders, stepped up to the podium. \n\n- The issue that I will be talking about today is one of grave importance. I speak today not as a populares, but instead as a senator concerned with the current ongoing crisis. As I assume you all know, recent findings have uncovered many inefficiencies and flaws in the system of Ager Publicus. Plebes working the lands of certain patricians and even some senators have been found to be exploited, overworked and unfairly rewarded for their labor. On top of that, cases of tax reports meant to fund the Res Publica being falsified have also been uncovered.\n\nMurmurs spread through the Senate hall, each quiet on their own, but gathering into a deafening clamor. The loudest and seemingly most concerned of the whispers spread from the seats occupied by the optimates. Before the noise could grow any louder, Kompa cleared his throat, returning the hall’s attention back to himself. As he continued to speak, he locked eyes with one man in particular: Petrus Caletus, the unofficial leader of the optimates.\n\n- A glaring problem within this whole ordeal is the inexcusable behavior of the optimates. Ever since the news of overreaches within the Ager Publicus have been brought to light, they haven’t done as much as lifted a finger in the way of fixing this problem. These actions speak louder than words and every Calisian will be well aware of their inaction. It’s really not surprising seeing them in this position; most cases of corruption and exploitation to varying degrees have been noted in properties owned directly, or indirectly by members of the optimates.\n\nKompa couldn’t help but feel accomplished, seeing the face of Consul Caletus drop from a veneer of confidence to a grimace of poorly bottled up rage. Murmurs once again drowned out any other noise within the hall, this time interspersed with chuckles from the side of the populares. This time, the murmurs dispersed on their own after a short while, letting the Consul continue unimpeded.\n\n- However, members of the populares are not guilt-free. Despite what some in this hall may think, this is not a reason to squabble amongst each other. Ager Publicus is flawed and we, as humble servants of the Res Publica must work to fix it. The fact of the matter is however, that reform..."

Others sported makeshift helmets and silvery fishscale overalls, which – apparently – were supposed to resemble lamellar armour. \n– You bunch of barbarian maggots ever heard of thermae or razors? – the prefect asked. \n– With all due respect, good sire – the horsemen leader rode forward – we were not keen on losing our identity, and our considerable facial hair, under new government. But, well, as we were recognised as equites of the empire, we, uh, found ourselves in need to adapt. We are still Sarmatians, only the ancient kind. The real one, if you prefer, good sire. \n\nThe silence was as uncomfortable as lamellar overalls. After a longer while, a young optio broke out. \n– Quintus... Quintus, don’t irritate yourself... \n– How I’m supposed not to irritate? \n– Easy, they’ll latinize... \n– They won’t latinize! Nothing will latinize! I won’t get another equites like that! We were supposed to recruit a good bunch of horsemen and not some steppe throatsinger wannabies! I bet they can’t even do Parthian shot! \n\nAs on command, a few arrows flew towards the Roman delegation.

The gates of palace was shut, and in each window, a rifleman waited for the command to open fire. \n\nRumour had it a whole legion was sent to capture the estates. How fitting that the Lechite monarchy was to be ended by its eternal Roman enemies! Or maybe not, the count thought. The cause of the Lechites would be taken up by another warlord elsewhere in Poland. There’s no need to be dramatic about it. \n\nAs Leszczyński walked through the halls of his palace, he noticed the portrait of his great ancestor, king of Poland, great duke of Lithuania, prince of Lotharingia Stanisław Leszczyński. His deeds and struggles imbued him with inspiration. The count stopped for a while and pondered. What would Leszczyński do? \n\nAnd so, Wojciech Edward I Leszczyński bailed the fuck out of his palace and escaped to France."

Regular, proper camp, although with no walls, ditches or alert guards, and certainly without latrines. Inside each tent, fresh legionaries were carefully tucked in, still sleeping soundly.

Mixed up fantasies about past and future mangled the minds of men and made the most outrageous outcomes a desirable possibility. Their brunt, physical consequences were skimmed off as flashy display of B-class movie action and pulp fiction tragedy. n\nOnce Poland experienced the Fall, a faint thought appeared in the minds of people of East and West alike, that contrary to a popular saying * something * might indeed happen, and that end of world as it was known was an actual possibility. Once Germany and Russia embroiled themselves in internal strife and civil war, this thought was widely acknowledged. One day people did not simply wake up, but persisted instead in a fever dream, where everything was possible, as long as it kept the stream of consciousness running. \n\nAs waves of refugees moved into Polish successor state known as Calisia, they found themselves in a place somewhat safer, but by far more bizarre. It seemed as a form of coping mechanism, therapy or mass escapism. It did seem helpful – to an extent – but it wasn’t for the refugees. These were aliens, numerous, noisy and downtrodden, disturbing hard-fought peace – and the coping mechanism found a way to cope with that as well. It branded them as barbarians – non-Romans, non-citizens, people of lesser civilisations. It sounded bizarre – as everything did. But, first and foremost, it was humiliating. \n\nAnd so the people of Germania Maior and Scythia, people of states fallen and humiliated, reached for an new-old identity.

calisia.57.t: "Vinicius' Plea"
calisia.57.desc: "– Marcus Vinicius came to visit you – a voice broke through a calm sound of flowing water. Calisius wiped his glasses from steam. A man in legionary armor walked through his private thermae towards tepidarium, where he currently lounged. \n– Ave, Caesar. May all gods grant you fortune, especially Asclepius and Cipride. \nThe emperor grumbled. – Of all the gods, why would you think I need Cypride the most? Do I look like an amorous man? – he rose from the pool, extending his arms as to present the nuda veritas of his outward appearance. – Don’t you feel like we’ve had this exact conversation before? \n– My apologies, o emperor. This was like... an involuntary reaction to this situation. I could really use a longer stay in the termae myself. \n – Oh Marcus, you know you can use my thermae whenever you need – Calisius gave him a wry smile. \n– You’re as gracious as ever, my emperor. – Vinicius bowed sharply. – Forgive me, for I have to refuse. I’m entirely overtaken by military matters. \n– Surely you could lend your duties to your assistants for some time. \n– It is not possible. All officers are constantly occupied. We’re understaffed on all lines, and men are taking leaves en masse. They don’t want to stay in camp on meagre pay while they could work at home. \n– It would be wiser for them to stay on the frontlines. – Calisius nodded and two servants rushed with a sizeable towel. The emperor climbed out of the pool and draped himself like he would in a toga. – How much would it take to keep more of them at arms? \n– It’s the fault of the system, my emperor. Our army is designed to be mobilised in full only during the season most appropriate for campaings. Once it has ended, most of the men ought to go back to the job marked or fieldwork, lest we ruin our economy. \n– You know full well we have to work with what we got. But I suppose we could pay less men full time for their better performance. \n– We could make the legions into a professional force. However, I’m afraid this would create a professional caste of warriors, separate from the rest of our citizens. \n– If you have an alternative in mind to an professional army, voice your opinion – Calisius said drily. \n– We could enroll more non-citizens as auxiliary troops. Allow them to defend Calisia like it was their homeland. This would give them a chance to improve their lot, and, perhaps, foster some loyalty. \nEmperor gestured vaguely, as if thinking of an argument."

calisia.58.t: "Conversatio Privata"
calisia.58.desc: "The office was dimmed, and Cinastovicus’ eyes took a while to adapt to the darkness. Calisius sat there alone, elbows on desk, fingers intertwined, thumbs holding up forehead. He had a laurel on his head – which seemed overly theatrical, even for someone like him. \n– Ave, emperor. You’ve requested for a private conference with me. \n– Sit down, Kinastowski – Calisius gestured to the chair in front of the desk. It was an ordinary office chair, as normal as could be. As he sat, the pretorian realised the room was completely unromanised – which only made the sight of emperor’s toga and his armor somewhat uncomfortable. \n– You are aware of the newest reports, right? – Calisius asked. \n– Of course, my emperor. I’ve mobilised the pretorian guard, they’re ready to march at on.. . \n– I wouldn’t call you here just to brief you on obviousness. I’m asking you whether you are aware what is happening. \n– I beg your pardon, sire... \n– If someone five years ago would tell you there’s a slave rebellion happening just an hour drive from your home, what would you do? \n– I was always against terrorism and acts of violence targeted at... \n– No. A * slave * rebellion. Think about it, Kinastowski. We have *slaves and now they are *killing landowners. You would think I lost my mind if I implied it could happen here, and not in some sort of Bantustan or whatever. \nThat’s it, Cinastovicus thought. He’s actually losing his mind. An impulsive grin appeared on the pretorian’s face, but he collected himself at a blink of an eye. – You must be joking, my emperor. You’re the one who had shown us the way to our current glorious... \n– I did not show the way for an accursed slave rebellion! – Calisius erupted, slamming his fist on the shamble desk. – Who do you think I am? A slave driver for your petty friends to get fat out of this miserable land? This madness has to be fini... – he paused for a while, breathing heavily, adjusting his glasses and, curtly, his laurel. – This has to be corrected. Populares are calling for abolishing slavery as it is now. I think it’s quite sensible as it is. You can surely acknowledge that it’s better to have an indentured servant that a slave that’s ready to cut your throat. \n– My apologies, oh divine emperor, but now it is too late. These are barbarians; it’s in their nature to cut throats. You don’t extend a hand to a beast that wants to bite you. Slaves will know their place... – „or you won’t have yours”, Cinastivicus ended in mind. \n– Thankfully you’re not the one who’s making all the decisions here. Order pretorians to stand easy, for now. "

unification.31.desc: "In a radio broadcast to all of Greater Poland, an address was given by none other than Ryszard Kalisz; Though anyone who has been around the region can say that the man speaking was no longer the same as everyone knew him before the Fall, going under the name Ricardus Calisius, all signs point to the politician seeking to establish a new Roman Empire in the heart of Poland following this radical change. Through skillfully swaying the local political figures he had managed to become a major contender in the region through semi-modernized Roman reforms. An army of Legionnaires, coinage with the Emperor’s facade and new marble buildings soon to be constructed in recently romanized cities really give off a look of being brought back to the distant past. It remains to be seen what will arise from this state of pseudo-Roman reenactors, though it goes without saying that even if their folly is to end, the Polish-Roman state will no doubt go down in history as another in a long list of oddities resulting from the Fall."

Despite relative economic weakness and sparse population, through a sequence of carefully planned offensives, the heavily disciplined legions of the Neo-Roman state managed to subdue the local warlords, entering the capital of Łódź in a wave of glory, followed by a grand Triumphal procession along the city’s main Piotrkowska street. \n\nFollowing the conquest, by the Emperor’s decree, the land has been divided up into new provinces in preparation for the Romanization of the Caesar’s new subjects, and from among those who embraced the cultured ways of their new rulers, new cohorts are being established to bolster the army in preparation for the next campaigns."

Through a string of increasingly grand triumphs, the elite cohorts have successfully spread civilization to the barbarians of Pomerania, with even the greatest strongholds falling to the imperial army. As with Navis before, the region is undergoing a massive Romanization campaign to bring culture to the poor illiterate brutes and welcome them as imperial subjects. The victorious soldiers and generals have been greatly rewarded for their success, with those who’ve distinguished themselves in combat granted generous swathes of land and the Imperator’s closest followers appointed as consuls of the new provinces. Once the territory has been fully integrated and the army strengthened with new recruits, the legions stand ready for their greatest campaign yet – the march on Varsovia."

After a decade of post-Fall anarchy, the nation has been fully reunified under the so-called Imperator Ricardus Calisius, a former SLD politician turned monarch. After crowning himself the emperor of the crumbling city of Kalisz, the Caesar earned the public’s favor, rebuilding the city in a neoclassical style from a pile of rubble into a truly worthy capital. With dozens of loyal legions under his command and the spirit of Augustus coursing through his veins, the great conqueror managed to subdue the entirety of the country, not even the barbarian kings of Varsovia and Cracovia able to stop his advance. \n\nFollowing the final Triumh, a grand celebration ensued with Calisian wine flowing in unending excess. The task ahead remains monumental, however, as rebuilding the ruined economy and Romanizing the millions of new citizens may prove to be an even greater challenge. \n\nThe Empire of Calisia shall ensure its eternal place in the sun!"

### CHARACTERS ###



POLITICS_RICARDUS_CALISIUS_DESC: "A former socialist, lawyer, politician – hardly the most respectable Cursus Honorum, although a typical one. For all of his life, Ryszard Kalisz felt some kind of yearning in the back of his mind. He could feel it while walking past the columns of the Supreme Court, inscribed with ancient legal maxims, watching Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra, or even just eating pizza. Whenever he held a speech, be it in court or in Sejm, he could feel the presence of someone far greater and wiser than the jury or the Marshal of the Sejm behind him. Back then, he would simply dismiss it and carry on. \n\nIt was right after the Fall his inner consciousness had awoken. Running away (either from the blast or the angered mob), he hid in a wine cellar in Kalisz. Whatever happened there will be forever shrouded in mystery. On the third day, he emerged, draped in a bedsheet tinted purple with Lazio wine, with a golden laurel on his head and perfect knowledge of all five Latin declensions. \n\nHowever odd Kalisz wouldn’t seem, the locals did greatly appreciate his restlessness and organizational talent. No one batted an eye when he ordered officials to wear togas or enforced Latin nomenclature. However, when he proclaimed himself the descendant of Jupiter, some people thought he might be going too far. By then, however, his rule had already been cemented. Kalisz approached members of local elites and offered them an attractive deal: land in exchange for political power. Soon afterward, the Senate convened and proclaimed Kalisz – now Ricardus Calisius – first, a consul for life and, soon after – the emperor of Calisia. The new dictator’s first edict shocked many to the bone: he reinstituted a form of indentured servitude, which turned out to be little more than thinly veiled slavery. \n\nCalisius walks a tightrope between the Optimates, which aim to seize as much wealth and power as possible, and the Populares, who point out the crying inequality in the nascent empire. The conflict is amplified by the uncertainty surrounding Calisius’ mental state. As mad as he seems, he did manage to reforge this piece of post-Fall Poland into a strong, well-functioning statelet. His past made many think he’d turn out to be an opportunist, but his decision to uphold democratic traditions by empowering the Senate proved he is just as much a Cincinnatus as an Augustus. The true extent of the Emperor’s ambition – or folly – will soon be unraveled..."
POLITICS_pawel_delag_DESC: "Once upon a time an actor named Paweł Deląg played a bad-boy-turned-good-guy Marcus Vinicius in a grandiose ancient Rome epic called Quo Vadis. Thus he earned a certain fame and reputation as „Poland sexiest actor of 2001”, while helping shape the image of a gory, immoral Roman Empire transforming into a more humane, Christian Europe. \n\nThat’s perhaps why Deląg, as soon as atomic dust settled, moved where ruins were modern and reconstruction was ancient.\n\nIt’s hard to assume whether he offered his service to Calisius out of conviction, lust for power or pure opportunism, or was simply bought. Nonetheless, placed at the helm of the legions, he quickly became the icon of the regime, most likely because he was the one who truly seemed like he was the right man in the right place. The people listen to his words, and the affection with which legionaries follow him would be hard to outweigh with money. Magnanimous, outgoing and tolerant, Vinicius quickly became a leader of the popular faction, believing that the new Eternal City can be a place where everyone can be a citizen of equal rights and duties; where bread and circuses serve a better purpose than controlling the masses. \n\nMarcus’ charm and popularity act like a column holding Calisius’ regime standing. It would seem the emperor’s past makes him sympathetic to popular ideas. The caesar could not think of a better friend... But can a friendship last forever?"
