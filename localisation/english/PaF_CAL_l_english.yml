CAL_senate_info_tt: "Senatus Populusque Calisiensis, just as Calisia itself, is a complicated and layered body, with many bickering factions.\n\nEach faction, be it Populares, Optimates, Legiones, Pretoriae, or even Emperor Ricardus himself, is represented by Gravitas. Gravitas shows how much power each player has within the Empire. Each faction gains quarterly gravitas, depending on a range of factors, such as:\n£white_dot 5 base gain\n£white_dot 10 per every consul\n£white_dot 0.1 per every seat in the Senate\n£white_dot 0.1 per every unit that has a general with the faction trait\n£white_dot 5 per every governor loyal to their faction\n\nThe Emperor has his own supply of gravitas that heavily depends on the loyalty and influence of the factions. If the gravitas of any particular faction is higher than the Emperor's, he will begin to lose his support base. The same goes for loyalty - if it drops too low, the Emperor's gravitas will also begin to crumble. You need to keep things balanced in order to maintain control.\n§RBE WARY! The Emperor's Gravitas should be used only as a last resort. If the level of Ricardus's Gravitas drops below 50 percent, there will be dire consequences.§!\n\nAside from Gravitas, every faction other than the Emperor, has its level of Loyalty, representing its devotion not to Calisia, but to Ricardus. Should he anger any of the factions, especially those closest to him, there will be severe consequences.\n\nThe Senate only has two factions in it, the previously mentioned Populares and Optimates. Obviously, not every grouping is one, uniform body. Each senatorial faction can be divided into hardliners and fair-weather Senators. The hardliners will always keep the factional discipline, and vote for every proposal of their respective faction. The same cannot be said, however, for the rest. Whenever there is a Lex introduced to the Senate, they are the ones who need to be convinced in order for the proposal to have any chance at passing. Otherwise, the opposition will make sure to offer enough bribes and favors to push their own version through."

No longer will the patricians have unrestricted power over their workers! From now on, the former slaves will turn into servants who are only bound to their masters for a specific amount of time. The servants will be protected by Calisian law, which will force the patricians to uphold their part of the contract. Ricardus Calisius hopes that, in the future, this institution will become the backbone of the imperial economy. All those responsible for the Trucidatio Ravitiensis will be forced into a form of such servitude under harsher than usual conditions. Let us hope this new fairer law will prevent tragedies like the one in Ravitium from ever happening again."

The merciful Calisius planned to find a better way of assimilating those foreigners into our society. But the Scythians stabbed him in the back, stabbed all of us in the back! Henceforth, to protect Calisian citizens and ensure the stability of our empire, the vast majority of the primitive peoples that we will conquer in the future... WILL! BE! ENSLAVED!

That is why if we want our civilization to prosper and conquer lesser peoples, we must preserve the purity of our culture.

Soon, important matters of state will be discussed, along with the Senate's usual duties. Citizens are once again welcome to send letters with matters they see as important enough to discuss. Mail meant to demean or poke fun at the Senators will be punished with a fine of 50 denarii.

The elections for the seats will be held in exactly two weeks from this day. Citizens who wish to partake in the democratic process can vote at the nearest polling station. The addresses of said locations will be announced a week before the election date. The glorious title of Senator comes with many benefits, including lodging in luxurious senatorial villas as soon as one becomes available."

CAL_lex_indentatae_servitutis: "Lex Indentatae Servitutis"
CAL_lex_indentatae_servitutis_desc: "The question of slavery raised during the Senate's ongoing session! Following the tragic events in Ravitium, a handful of Populares have occupied the rostrum, demanding an immediate end to Calisia's system of forced labor! After a long spat, the factions have agreed to put the matter to a vote, resulting in a more moderate proposal by the reformers to transition to a temporary form of servitude with an option to buy out one's contract after a specified period of work. Concerned about the economic impact, the Optimates demand the labor to instead be performed by subservient populations, enshrining their status as Servi in return for the state providing them housing and appropriate sustenance. Large protests of barbarian groups have erupted in opposition to the proposal."

CAL_lex_militae: "Lex Militae"
CAL_lex_militae_desc: "Reinforcements for the army imminent as the Senate finalizes a new bill regarding conscription! In response to requests by Legate Vinicius and other high military commanders, the chamber has swiftly and collectively agreed to expand current conscription laws to ensure a larger force capable of supporting all theaters of war. After a promising start, the issue has bogged down around the matter of which groups should be included in the decree, with the Populares advocating for the founding of barbarian formations as a supplement for the current manpower issues. Claiming them to be untrustworthy and their loyalty to Calisia to be unclear, the Optimates vehemently oppose this idea, claiming that size can be sacrificed and that their smaller, professional army will be far more effective against external threats. While the factions remain polarized on the issue, the final shape of the bill will likely be decided by a handful of undecided senators, unless a passable compromise can be found."

CAL_lex_tributorum: "Lex Tributorum"
CAL_lex_tributorum_desc: "The solution to the Empire's financial woes drawing nearer! A consensus has been reached among all factions regarding the necessity of a tax reform, and plans have been introduced to the Senate by both parties highlighting the areas where further funds could be obtained for the treasury. True to their name, the Populares insist on an increased tax on the wealthy to not only fix the budgetary deficit but also ease the burden on the impoverished. Outraged at what they refer to as \"an attack on those contributing the most to our shared prosperity,\" the Optimates have instead opted for increased financial obligations on barbarians residing within imperial territory, deemed a more-than-overdue repayment for the benefits they reap. Due to multiple factions and action groups weighing in on the issue, the deadlock is expected to continue for now."

CAL_lex_mercatoria: "Lex Mercatoria"
CAL_lex_mercatoria_desc: "The Senate once again locked in a deadlock! Following a discussion regarding the status of the export of Calisian premium goods, both factions have presented their solutions for opening up our markets for external trade! While the Populares remain insistent that the primary focus should not be to merely drive up the numbers but also combat monopolistic practices by unfair brokers, the Optimates have blocked their proposal, highlighting the need to reduce tariffs to facilitate wider export networks. For now, the parties have turned their focus to gathering enough support for one of the proposals to actually pass. Stay tuned for further updates."

CAL_lex_securitatis: "Lex Securitatis"
CAL_lex_securitatis_desc: "The Senate is once again in session! While during today's proceedings, both factions agreed with the need to strengthen our Empire's internal security in a rare display of bipartisan unity, all chances of a combined bill were quickly dashed following the Optimates' insistence on numerous provisions deemed overly harsh and bloodthirsty by the Optimates. In response, the factions once again broke off all contact and presented two separate plans for the chamber's consideration.

The Senate's progress appears to be halting due to the rising conflict between the Senators, and voters are advised to exact pressure on their politicians to avert yet another political deadlock..."

Soon, the best sons of Calisia will vote on the matter of the death penalty for the worst of crimes. The motion to introduce poenae capitalis to our realm has been issued by the Optimates. They say the the most vile of criminals should die a painful death for their transgressions, in public, might I add. Despite the rumors, only a slight minority of Optimates supports crucifixion, and this method of execution will not find itself in the official act. As always, they are opposed by the Populares, who are of the opinion that if we can, in time, civilize the barbarians, then we should attempt to give them a chance at redemption, especially since some of them are native Calisians."

CAL_lex_iuononis: "Lex Iunonis"
CAL_lex_iuononis_desc: "Decisive actions by the Senate regarding the status of women in the empire! A heated debate rages on between the factions, with two separate legislations introduced. The delegation of the Populares has promised radical reforms, fully granting female citizens all legal rights and protections, including a total ban on the mistreatment and non-consensual capture of female barbarians. A counter-proposal has been introduced by the Optimates, promising increased rights, but emphasizing the importance of traditional roles, and vowing to extend protections only to those bound by Calisian law. Voting on the matter is expected to be concluded within the coming month."

CAL_lex_civitatis_desc: "Changes to the citizenship acquisition process imminent! Recognizing the need for reform, the Senate has begun deliberations on a new bill that will widen existing paths for one to be officially recognized as Calisian. The Populares promise sweeping change, aiming to extend citizenship to anyone of sufficient status residing on the Empire's territory, should they prove their service to His Grace, Ricardus Calisius. The bipartisanship of this proposal has been rejected by the Optimates, who instead advocate for a one-time financial tribute, equal to the monthly upkeep of a maniple. All affected are asked to refrain from displays of support for their preferred option, so as to not influence the natural course of the debate."

CAL_lex_acculturationis_desc: "Dear citizens! At the personal request of the Emperor, as a result of our growing territory and constant increase in non-Calisian subjects, the Senate has agreed to consider the issue of whether barbarian-born individuals can truly be inducted into our superior culture. As per the statement of the Populares, 'to be Calisian is a matter not of birth, but rather a result of embracing our common values.' Senators loyal to the faction wish to secure funding for extensive cultural programs to enlighten the subjugated populations. In response, the Optimates postulate that certain groups are inherently barbaric, and to teach them our ways would merely be a waste of resources. \n\nCitizens are welcome to voice their opinions on the matter. A poll will be conducted shortly, asking whether residents of the Eternal City would be comfortable considering a person of barbarian origin as a fellow Calisian."

CAL_lex_amoris_liberi: "Lex Amoris Liberi"
CAL_lex_amoris_liberi_desc: "Rights for same-sex couples on the agenda for the upcoming Senate session! A vocal progressive sub-faction of the Populares managed to force the inclusion of the matter in the chamber's proceedings, pushing for legislation to recognize and grant protections for long-standing partnerships. The proposal has sparked outrage within the conservative wing of the Optimates, who claim it to be an overt attack on Calisian values and traditions. Their counter-bill vows to evoke the example of our ancient forebearers, allowing males to sleep with others of strictly lower status, as long as the citizen in question takes the dominant role. \nThe final version of the act is expected to be signed into law by the conclusion of the next Mensis."

CAL_lex_aesculapii: "Lex Aesculapii"
CAL_lex_aesculapii_desc: "A meeting of the Senate will convene in a week's time to discuss the matters of healthcare in the Res Publica. Proposals for legislature have been put forward by both the Optimates and Populares, and they follow as such: \nThe Populares seek to create a centralized, state-run health service for all Calisian citizens, claiming it's a necessity to keep every part of Calisian society in perfect health. \nThe Optimates, however, put forward the notion of basing Calisia's healthcare system around a wide network of private healthcare facilities, along with treatments that are, in their own words, not harmful to the soul. Thus far, an equilibrium exists between the two proposals."

CAL_lex_religionis: "Lex Religionis"
CAL_lex_religionis_desc: "Matter of religious direction introduced before the Senate! Demands for complete secularization of the Empire by the radicals within the Populares have led to a rare three-way split within the chamber, with the opposition failing to decide on the one true pantheon. While the cult of Jupiter has gained significant popularity within the ranks of the Optimates, many see a return to polytheistic practices as a step too far. A wide coalition has formed, straddling both sides of the aisle, in a bid to preserve the special status of Catholicism and formally recognize it as the primary religion of Calisia. According to a prominent member of our beloved legislative, the deadlock has been ongoing since the opening of the session and is expected to continue well into the coming weeks."

His plan is for the deceased to be moved to newly built catacombs! Our best miners and architects will ensure that they will resemble those of the bygone times. Praying for the dead underground was the way of the first Christians in Rome, and from those catacombs, our predecessors spread the word of Christ to all the edges of the ancient empire. The Imperator hopes the rough conditions of the catacombs will result in a similar level of religious awakening.

Their blood, full of sea salt, is still in our veins!

What parts of the text could be deciphered were revealed to be a stream of insults directed at the Praetorian Guard and the First Praetor, with far more of the writing, likely equally vulgar, still remaining on the improvised explosive. Investigators from the Guard revealed the substance used was in fact Greek Fire, most likely originating from the crates that were stolen from a manufacturing plant in weeks past.

Neither their personal merits nor achievements for our country can wash away the blame. That is what separates our republic from the barbarian kingdoms we rightfully despise. Who knows?

The consuls only want to punish the scheming traitors, and every sane person can see those legionaries are not the ones to blame.

They reached an agreement with Marcus Vinicius, and the three of them declared themselves the Triumvirs of Calisia, dedicated to the preservation of the Republic. From now on, Calisia will be divided into three equal parts to govern the realm more efficiently! Each Triumvir will govern in a nearly independent manner, dealing with their lands as they see fit. Each will implement the reforms they think are the best. Such competition of systems will help determine the best course of action when the Empire finally unifies, as well as prevent civil wars dictated by the lack of consensus about internal policy. Long live unity! Long live the Triumvirate! Long live Calisia!\n\nAdditional message to travelers and merchants: Remember to listen to your local newsreader in order to find out to whose jurisdiction you were assigned."

Starting next week, with the introduction of new identity documents for all citizens of the Republic, there will be a reassumption of pedigrees and the right to citizenship. Anyone who can prove their descent from the Venedic lineage will automatically belong to the noble ranks of Calisia's citizens.\n\nAll Calisians are one family!

Breweries and distilleries have mostly shut down, as sugar beets and barley are being repurposed for food! Rationing is in effect. Anyone suspected of counterfeiting food stamps will be subject to summary judgment!

The traitorous Legate must come to realize that despite the division we are still one Empire, an Empire designed to work as a whole. One jealous Triumvir should not blackmail the others due to coveting their privileged position! That is why Triumvir Caletus demanded Vinicius to relinquish his surpluses of wheat. FOR FREE! That is right! Petrus Caletus represents the Senate; what legitimacy does Vinicius have to refuse his demand? If he is foolish enough to oppose us, we will march to Cracovia and take the food from him by force! We are ready for such a possibility, although we hope it will not come to such extremes, which is why, after lengthy deliberations, our Senators have composed a letter detailing the principles of harmonious cooperation, likening the Triumvirate to an organism, whose parts should work in unison or they all perish away. They wrote that we deserve a fair share of grain for our efforts of defending the border against the vilest kinds of barbarians. The greatest minds of our time have helped the Senators conjure up the most suitable words about the suffering the particularist selfishness could cause.

Because of his murder of our beloved Emperor? Because of his corrupt rule? Because of his fragmentation of Calisia? Yet, for the sake of peace, Legate Vinicius refrains from unwarranted aggression against the usurper despite his crimes. However, the threats of violence may force Vinicius's hand. From now on, not only the export of grain to the senatorial provinces is forbidden. Vinicius declared that all trade with the usurpers and traitors must be stopped.

We have a right to execute the Frumenatarii for their excesses and burn Varsovia for this insult. However, Triumvir Caletus is willing to give his former associate one last chance.

Preposterous! It is clearly a way of blaming us for their own incompetence. How pitiful. As you may expect, our fearless leader is not going to bend under the weight of Caletus's lies.

Today, I am honored to announce that the previous words of condemnation against the great Calisius uttered by Marcus Vinicius during our Empire's darkest days were only a false testimony given under the threat of death. That, however, did not stop him from exacting his revenge! Waiting for the opportune time to strike, he managed to capture and execute one of the co-conspirators.

Do not mistake this focus on statehood for resting on our laurels and forgetting that our true capital remains in Calisia.

As the faction with the most republican legitimacy and the original Senate within our border, we are well within our right to demand submission from the mere bodyguards.

calisia.1.t: "First Contact"
calisia.1.desc: "EXTRAORDINARY REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL MINISTRY OF WAR ON THE 'FINIS GERMANICUM' OPERATION: \n\n\nAt exactly 7:00, a centuria belonging to the structures of Legio I Alpha began limited hostilities across the riverline. Our Auxilia report the initial resistance to be middling, with severe manpower shortages along the whole front, disastrous morale, and delayed equipment supply shipments. Numerous border outposts have been completely abandoned, and many more have only been left with minimal crews to provide the guise of operation. Upon contact, both units, including the centuria, displayed limited combat effectiveness, yet our forces managed to push past the first two lines of the Germanic defenses before retreating as per the initial orders. The Ministry estimates that the Eurokommissariat is currently entirely unsuited for war, both swift and protracted. There exists a high chance that their forces may entirely splinter, and any potential operation might possibly be conducted with minimal casualties. Upon comparison with the initial estimates and a review of the legions' combat readiness, the Ministry issues the following strong recommendation:"
calisia.1.a: "Kesselberg delenda est!"

calisia.2.t: "Behind the Purple Curtains"
calisia.2.desc: " - What will the Emperor do now? - Conradus, one of the royal servants, unable to cope with the lingering stress, burst out.\n - I heard he plans to reform the system of public land - his colleague tried to ease his companion's worries.\n - Oh Kacper, don't be ridic... - despite the distress, he managed to refrain from saying something that could offend the Emperor. No one knew who could overhear them. - I mean, why would he?\n - Why, he was the one who curtailed the corrupt clergy and took their land. - Caspar backed up his case - He cares for the poor.\n - But redistributing it to the masses - Conradus tried to be much more careful with his words now - That would contradict his previous actions. He used those lands to appease the soldiers and the financial elite.\n\nThe conversation continued for some time, and just as Caspar feared, someone was indeed spying on them and many other servants. Imperator Ricardus Calisius ordered his agents to overhear the rumors surrounding him. To find any traces of a conspiracy and... to satisfy his ego. The Dominus bathed in the attention he was getting from the servants, soldiers, and senators alike. All unsure about his next move. However, the light of the imperial glory cannot outshine the burning flame of corruption that began to slowly consume his domain. Something meaningful had to be done. \nSomething inside him yearned for drastic actions to help the poor masses. A memory etched beyond the edge of his mind. A memory of the red and gold standards of a bygone empire, but not of the old Rome. Something more recent. Something he knew more... intimately. \nCalisius took a sip of his favorite Latium wine to calm his troubled mind. Whatever noble intentions he may have had, he has long since realized that the wealthy senators were the ones financing his state and providing economic progress. Still, the excesses of the corrupt quaestors had to be stopped, even if he needed to take the side of the patricians in the brewing conflict to accomplish it. \nOne thing was certain - he had to break the silence and implement reforms, either revolutionary or evolutionary, to the Ager Publicus system. His postponement of the matter has raised the tension and expectations so high, even the gods on Olympus were aware of them. He'll have to deliver a speech great enough to meet those expectations."

calisia.3.desc: "- ...and according to my worker's measurements, the car should have easily passed through and made it into the room! We've cut out half the eastern wall specifically for this! \n- ...oh Jesus-Christ-Jupiter just... go. Begone. Thanks. \n- O- o-o-of-of-of course. Ave Calisius... \n\nThe Emperor was tired of this whole mess already. For the past 3 hours, he'd been listening to the panic and stutter of ashamed Senators who failed to fit in the ceremony's theme, and he was really starting to hurt from sitting in the same position for all this time. \nThe fools who already laid their gifts in front of him also weren't helping - they've clumped themselves together in one of the hall's corners and were now bickering with each other about their incompetence and lack of organization. Some of them came to the ceremony with birthday cups and hats, others packed their gifts like Christmas presents, and some were even ostentatiously throwing themselves at the Emperor's feet. And they were doing it the wrong way, too - as if he was a pharaoh, not an Augustus. \n\nAll, however, were beaten in their idiocy by a certain two stooges: the one who decided to enter the hall in *great style*, whom the Emperor's just dismissed after the Scoda Superbus he was meant to be gifted failed to fit in the hole specially prepared in the room's wall, nearly robbing the Palatio Embolutia off of its restaurant wing's roof, and almost decapitating Iacobus - previously a student, nowadays Calisius' personal aide (or maid, rather), who risked getting trampled to death by a crowd of senators and their guards leaving the hall just to present his ruler with a toaster. A fucking *toaster*. \n\nThe Paralympics in sucking up to the Emperor lasted for another hour or two until the last senator promptly stormed out of the building after bestowing the throne with a pair of anti-slip socks and an Aves Iratae-themed bedding set. Finally - the palace was emptied of any civil servants, a small wave of servants flooding the building's rooms in their stead. Immediately, Calisius started manually delegating them to various tasks in a tired, irritated voice. \n- You. Get a brush and tidy the shelves. You, you, and you - deal with the shit on the tables. You three will handle the floor. You! Call whatever builders are still working at this time of the day and tell 'em to patch up the goddamn wall, and *YOU*, Iacobus..."

calisia.4.t: "The Unenlightened Masses..."
calisia.4.desc: "Andreas Compa and Raphael Hvedorcus, the two unofficial leaders of the Populares met to hear the report of how the bestowments of gifts to Calisius went.\n - Great, oh Consul, everything went completely fine. - He laughed nervously. \n - Get out! - Compa saw through the lies of the emissary. - Had it not been for the avalanche of work I had to take care of, I'd have gone there myself and done it properly.\nIndeed, as a qualified historian of late antiquity, Compa was the perfect candidate to navigate the meanders of courtly etiquette, especially since he primarily specialized in the intrigues of Byzantine history.\n - At this point, we'll never convince Calisius to implement our plans. - Lamented Hvedorcus.\n - Your plans, you mean? - Compa thought to himself.\nWhile all of the Populares wanted to ease the pain of the poor and democratize the Empire, Hvedorcus was one of the more radical members who wanted to go even further. He planned for workers' syndicates or sodalitates and collegia to be the main form of economic organization.\n - Thank God... or gods, I'm here to temper him. - Compa congratulated himself in his mind. Truth be told, together they were quite a political powerhouse, with Hvedorcus coming up with the reform programs and Compa selling them to the Emperor wrapped in authentic Roman terminology.\nWhile the duo shined at the court, as intellectuals and outsiders, they met certain difficulties while dealing with the supposed backbone of their movement, the lower classes. Of course, they liked their noble, academic presence, but direct interactions were usually quite awkward. That's why they had the men for the dirty work. When they needed to appease a local mayor, they usually sent someone like Silvius Iacobinus, an elder of Ferrulum, to visit him with alcohol, butter him up, and now, you've got a mayor on your side. However, even Iacobinus can't be everywhere and drink alcohol with all of the imperial subjects (despite what he claims). That's why someone like the leader of the legionaries, Marcus Vinicius, would be a great asset to the Populares' cause. Would be, as, despite his formal allegiance to the faction, he cares little for it, preferring to focus on his service to the Emperor while remaining apolitical.\n - OK, the show's over! - ruled Compa - Everyone, get back to work. If the Optimates face the same problem as we do, our government may yet hold onto power."

The rest of the Optimates in the room joined him, though with much less enthusiasm.\n- Oh, if that's how they handle things without supervision, maybe I shouldn't try to push them to do any better. That shit's just too funny. - Caletus thought to himself. - Alright, next time, read some protocols and learn some Latin, or you'll screw the... *admissio* again. The official part of the meeting is over. Let us enjoy wine in my atrium. You may go. I will join you in a short time.\n\nAs the fellow supporters of the Optimates' cause were leaving the room, Caletus was pondering the future of their faction.\nDespite the joy of witnessing numerous fuck-ups, Kaleta... Caletus knew he needed to get his stuff together if his faction was going to succeed. He had already underestimated those Populares once, and Calisius chose them as his current advisors. He did that despite the familiarity he and Thaddaeus Scarginscis had regarding the ins and outs of local politics. Despite the quiet approval of Cinastovicus and his Praetorians. Even despite the fact that the Optimates are more beloved by the very populus the Populares claim to represent.\n\n- Still, I shouldn't be surprised. - Caletus thought to himself. - Despite their flaws, the eggheaded outsiders were more pragmatic when it turned out Calisius was serious about his attempts to resurrect Rome in Polonia. They quickly adopted the appropriate jargon, dressed in togas, and used Latin interjections as often as they could. The traditionalist leader of the Optimates was, at the beginning, unwilling to comply with the new rules. And he paid the price. After Calisius humiliated him by siding with the Populares, he realized he would need to become Senator Caletus if he wanted to rule Calisia. Now that the transformation was complete, the well-oiled machine of the Optimates, with Caletus' crowd-winning plainspokenness, helped by the authority of the mighty Gaius Ceplus, and the secrets uncovered for them by Cinastovicus will be unstoppable.\n - Ugh, enough thinking for one day. Thaddaeus, let's head to the atrium before those drunks empty all of my barrels."

calisia.8.desc: "Year: [GetYear]\nLocation: Abbasinum\n\nAve Imperator Ricardus Calisius.\nAs your highness dictated, I have conducted a thorough inspection into the matters of Ager Publicus in Abbasinum. Due to the proximity to the Urbs, a local patrician, Vilius Avarus, was determined to hide his crimes. While pretending to possess just an average-sized farm, in truth, he has built his own latifundium. Using strongarm tactics, he either forced the coloni to pay rent to him or confiscated the land for himself. The latter was achieved through his alliance with the local iudex. His associate framed several coloni and sentenced them to a life of slavery. Avarus became the owner of the land, bought said slaves, landed them, and ordered them to present themselves as independent coloni in case a regular quaestor control appeared. That is why I had to act in secret. I have disguised myself as a worker looking for employment. I was observed regularly, and my freedom of movement was restricted. I became a slave, kept in truly Spartan conditions until I was able to escape to report the situation in Abbasinium to Your Highness. By my observation, the way he treated me is his modus operandi regarding all workers in his estate. As Your Majesty can guess, the state of the Calisian countryside is catastrophic. Wealthy landowners control the land and reap the fruits of our fertile soil. The poor suffer under their iron fist. The dissonance between Your Majesty's vision and the practical implementation of Ager Publicus is striking. I suggest immediate and drastic action."

And he worked for less than minimal wage. \n- Enough with the talk. Show me your projects! - Calisius commanded. \nA few bills were set before him. On the obverse, there was the usual profile of the Emperor. On the reverse - the depictions of Legions crossing the Prosna on a makeshift bridge, either capturing a tank or fighting barbarians. \n- Is that a Germanic? Beaten over the helmet? A timeless classic. I'm sure the men will appreciate these. \n- O, Emperor! You honor me, but please reconsider whom you will reward. Those legionaries are dirty scoundrels, and their Vinicius is a good-for-nothing. Don't let those bills fall into their dirty hands; they'll squander them in one day. The Praetorians, on the other hand, would-  \n- I know full well I'll see this money once in my life and never again. The true problem is the feast for whoever gets the Donativum. \n- What do you mean, oh divine? \n- The legionaries would probably appreciate a whole load of huge, cheap Venedic-style pizza. Greasy, thick, with a whole load of cheese. Plus, a ton of cheap wine. Jabols, even. I'm not sure if this is what we want to strive for. Bread, circuses, and an orgy all day long - Calisius sighed. - Meanwhile, the Praetorians would expect an actual Napoletana, and while I do enjoy a good Napoletana, it's a bit on the nose. These men are thugs, first and foremost, and they won't distinguish a good Umbrian wine from Ranula's Fresco. They just want wealth and, with it, power. \n\nThe Emperor grabbed a bill to wipe out the sweat from his forehead. No matter whom he would choose..."

The barracks barely resembled their usual self, upscaled into a lavish, albeit impromptu dining hall. Still, all the forced decorum and self-aggrandizement of the late soirée could barely conceal the true brutishness of Calisia's upstart elite guard. With each swig of the finest local red, the carefully crafted mannerisms that allowed the praetorians to brush shoulders with the Emperor himself clashed with their plebeian nature, slowly devolving the meeting into a feast only Bacchus would look favorably upon. \n\nFrom among the dozen voices of high-ranking officers trying to shout over one another in their drunken stream of consciousness, the center of attention slowly shifted toward the central figure of the pack, still clad in his full suit of armor. Christianus Cinastovicus might not seem like the most imposing figure, yet the regal purple adorning his figure exuded a whole different aura - prestige, and authority. When he raised his cup into the air, the chatter immediately quieted down. \n\n- Enjoy yourselves tonight, men, for our drinks are paid from the Emperor's coffers! Ave Calisius! - an agreeing cheer followed the words. The praetorians needed no encouragement to empty another round, but knowing it was their sovereign's Denarius sponsoring the feast made the wine taste even sweeter. \n- His Highness finally decided to reward our exemplary service with a nice little bonus. Guess protection has a steep price when you're the most hated man in Calisia. - he snarkily continued. \n- Oh please. The old sod's gonna have his heart give out long before anyone could actually strike at him. - a jolly guard interrupted, forgetting himself amid the drunken conversation. \n- That 'old sod' is your only path to a paycheck, Gaius. And your only chance at actual relevancy. You better pray he lives long enough for you to earn yourself a comfortable pension. \n- And what if our beloved Emperor ever grows stingy with his protection money, Christianus? \nThe praetorian leader smiled in mutual understanding. \n- Oh, it's quite simple..."

calisia.11.desc: "This was the focal point. One of many, but perhaps the most notorious. You wouldn't go there if you weren't ripe enough, with wine - and arms. Not after dark. The men picked fights over everything. Games, wenches, politics, past and future - you name it. They were worse than their fathers and brothers, the young men who came before. More drunk, more belligerent. Actually convinced about their impunity. That is until they've started being whipped in the barracks. \n\nNonetheless, the old man looked at them with little fear or resentment. It's true, some of them did not consider a 'kebab' something worth spending their salarium on. There was no arguing with them; just a quick nod to the cohortes urbanae when they arrived to pick up this night's offenders. However, the majority of the guests were drunk and magnanimous enough to leave more sesterces than necessary just to show off. It would seem that respect for the man behind the counter weighed more than esteem among one's comrades. \n\nAs the drunk legionaries were knocked down by either clubs or alcohol, the old Saracen thought to himself that this masquerade was somewhat... enjoyable. Everyone had to play their part, and his was fairly easy: no one knew what a 'Roman kebab' was supposed to be like, so he could improvise. But the clients, especially the legionaries, acted differently. True, they were a bunch of aggressive, drunk, and probably racist young men with a need to knock someone up or down - just like before. But this time, they had a purpose. They wanted to fight for the city. To protect it. Maybe just because they were better paid nowadays.\n\nOr maybe, because they actually began to care. \n\nThe owner shrugged, soaked the mop, and started wiping vomit, blood, and sauce from the floor. Another night came to an end."

calisia.13.t: "Gracchus' Gall"
calisia.13.desc: "Another gathering of the Senate, another few hours of listening to other Senators speak with audibly forced eloquence about the need to make a dog park somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Normally, Consul Andreas Compa would be bored out of his mind, dozing off, exchanging glares with some Optimates, or simply chatting with other senators to either of his sides, however, today, he had no time for meaningless chatter. In fact, he didn't have much time for anything as he sat there stressfully, clenching a small file of papers in his hands. Compa was given the dubious honor of delivering a speech that could either kickstart or kill the idea of reforming the Ager Publicus on arrival. Time flew by him, and soon enough, it was finally his time to speak before his colleagues. He stood up and, with the weight of the world crashing down upon his shoulders, stepped up to the podium. \n\n- The issue that I will be talking about today is one of grave importance. I speak today not as a member of the Populares but instead as a senator concerned with the current ongoing crisis. As I assume you all know, recent findings have uncovered many inefficiencies and flaws in the system of Ager Publicus. Plebeians working the lands of certain patricians and even some senators have been found to be exploited, overworked, and unfairly rewarded for their labor. On top of that, cases of tax reports meant to fund the Res Publica being falsified have also been uncovered.\n\nMurmurs spread through the Senate hall, each quiet on their own but combining into a deafening clamor. The loudest and seemingly most concerned of the whispers spread from the seats occupied by the Optimates. Before the noise could grow any louder, Compa cleared his throat, turning the hall's attention back to himself. As he continued to speak, he locked eyes with one man in particular: Petrus Caletus, the unofficial leader of the Optimates.\n\n- A glaring problem within this whole ordeal is the inexcusable behavior of the Optimates. Ever since the reports of overreaches within the Ager Publicus have been brought to light, they haven't done as much as lifted a finger in the way of fixing this problem. These actions speak louder than words, and every Calisian will be well aware of their inaction. It's really not surprising seeing them in this position; most cases of corruption and exploitation to varying degrees have been noted in properties owned directly or indirectly by members of the Optimates.\n\nCompa couldn't help but feel accomplished seeing the face of Consul Caletus drop from a veneer of confidence to a grimace of poorly bottled-up rage. Murmurs once again drowned out any other noise within the hall, this time interspersed with chuckles from the side of the Populares. This time, the murmurs dispersed on their own after a short while, letting the Consul continue unimpeded.\n\n- However, members of the Populares are not guilt-free. Despite what some in this hall may think, this is not a reason to squabble amongst each other. Ager Publicus is flawed, and we, as humble servants of the Res Publica, must work to fix it. The fact of the matter is, however, that reform..."

calisia.14.t: "An Idyllic Revolution"
calisia.14.desc: "Paulus was a wealthy man, his manor - a display of opulence so typical of the nouveau riche. Many speculated just how the former farmer managed to hoard enough wealth to become one of Calisia's largest landowners despite never having a meaningful source of income. He always seemed to have enough gold to keep them all quiet, though. With powerful friends in places both high and low, nothing happened in Calisia without Paulus' explicit acknowledgment. Until an angry mob showed up in front of his estate, that is. \n\nBy now, Paulus had been used to his serfs occasionally getting uppity. Every time some overly ambitious Popular introduced a clearly doomed reform, the rabble stirred, desperately seeking a chance to break free from their master. Nothing a few lashes couldn't fix. Still, the landowner had grown rather accustomed to getting an early warning from his proteges within the Optimates. Ever since he first started sponsoring the faction, not once have they forgotten to consider their benefactor. This was different. Something was definitely wrong. \n\nThough a tinge of fear gripped his chest, Paulus raised his chin proudly and approached his servants with a nobleman's typical poise. Almost upon sight, a particularly notable troublemaker, Andrzej, spat at his master's feet. \n\n- Your time's coming to an end, tyrant! We're done serving you! Soon you'll be the one breaking your back with the plow to make ends meet while we reap the rewards for our years of hard labor. \n- This again, Andrzej? We've been through it before. I don't know what crazy propaganda piece you've seen this time, but you seem to forget the strength of our wonderful status quo. Like always. Now, get back in the field, and I won't even double your quota. \n- Oh, sure you will! You have no power over us anymore. Once the reform of this 'Ager Publicus' you cling to finally passes the Senate, you'll be left with nothing. If you have your brains still with you, I suggest you run, otherwise, we'll take everything you owe by force. Though... actually, please do stay, we'll get to enjoy it far more that way. \n\nPaulus could feel his heart race. He anticipated the situation in the capital to be dire, but the boldness of the peasants' claims was enough to make him terrified for his life. In every other situation, they made sure to tone down their rhetoric, leaving themselves a peaceful way back into his graces in case things fell through. And he'd always been merciful, at least that's what he always told himself. His neighbors were far worse, after all. He'd never burned, blinded, or castrated anyone, so if even he was the subject of such vitriol, things had to be critical. Foregoing his authoritative mannerisms, Paulus hurriedly ran back to his manor and readied his carriage. Once again, he was going straight to Calisia to fix the others' mess."

calisia.15.t: "Triumph in Gnesna"
calisia.15.desc: "In the shadow of looming clouds, the conquerors' march heralded the fall of Gniezno, once a proud bastion of Przemysł III's realm. The streets, once teeming with life, now whispered with lamentation as the Calisian legions imposed their dominion. The ancient stones, imbued with the echoes of Poland's storied past, beheld a scene of desolation - a kingdom's lament etched upon its very foundations. There was no cheer, no triumphant entry, no festivities either. \n\nGniezno's citadel, now subdued, bore witness to the inexorable passage of fate. Przemysł III, once sovereign, now captive, trudged amidst his captors, his regal bearing eclipsed by the weight of defeat. The conquerors, merciless in their triumph, paraded the former king, the vanquished leader, the unbound defender of his vassals through the desolate thoroughfares, akin to Vercingetorix's ignominious procession in ancient Gaul. No jubilant cheers resounded through the streets, no banners waved in celebration. Instead, a pall of sorrow hung heavy in the air, mourning the loss of sovereignty and the end of an era. The legions paid no heed to the silent grief that enveloped the city as their eyes were fixed on the horizon, where the sun of Calisian hegemony rose triumphant, consolidating their first important conquest.\n\nAnd so, amidst the ruins of a once-great city, Przemysł III, defeated but unbowed, marched on. He seemed to be a symbol of resistance in the face of adversity, his spirit unbroken despite the chains that bound him. But he was about to rot in the dungeons for the years ahead. The defiance of the armies of the Principality of Gniezno had sealed their fate, and there was no warm home that would welcome them back from their war campaign. There was only the cold iron of shackles and the prospect of spending the rest of their lives in a dark cell. Such was the future that Calisia had brought. A trip to the past as a prisoner of a rising empire."

calisia.16.t: "Triumph in Lessna Polonorum"
calisia.16.desc: "In Leszno, once the historical seat of the Leszczyński family, the remains of a fire smoldered. Wojciech Edward Leszczyński ensured that nothing would fall into the hands of the advancing Calisian army. All the most important documents were destroyed, the main administrative centers burned down, and the city itself initially had the appearance of a deserted battlefield. Leszno's cobbled streets, which had echoed with the tumult of conflict, now reverberated with the disciplined steps of the Calisian troops. The citizens, emerging from the shadows of their homes, watched with wary eyes as the conquerors passed. Their faces bore the marks of recent hardships, but in their gazes flickered a tentative hope, kindled by the promise of stability and new beginnings that Calisian legions were bringing.\n\nIn the midst of this conquest, a grand triumph was to be held that would herald the dawn of Calisian rule over Leszno. The procession was led by Ricardus Calisius, the Emperor himself, whose presence commanded both awe and reverence. He surveyed the assembled crowd with a serene yet authoritative gaze. Behind him followed the ranks of his legionaries, their armor gleaming, their banners held high. The sight, though imposing, carried a promise of order and renewal. There was one missing spot in this whole parade - the leader of the conquered nation wasn't there to see the downfall of his entire kingdom for himself.\n\nAs the procession advanced, the citizens of Leszno began to gather in greater numbers. Their initial hesitance gave way to cautious applause, a gesture of reluctant acceptance mingled with the hope for a better future. The Calisian soldiers, disciplined and resolute, acknowledged the people with nods of respect, signaling a departure from the cruelty of the previous overlords. The people of Leszno had yet to experience the true reality of life in the Calisian Empire, but for now, it was just a province to be integrated, so it was treated with utmost care. The Emperor began his speech, painting a vision of a future where Leszno would flourish under the benevolent rule of Calisia, where the scars of war would heal, and where every citizen would have a stake in the city's resurgence. It was enough for them to believe. But loyalty will have to be earned."

calisia.17.t: "Triumph in Mercuria Maior"
calisia.17.desc: "The Sarmatian beast was tamed; the sound of thundering hooves on the steppes of Jarocin gave way to the steady march of Calisian legions. At Kórnik's keep, the defeated leader of Terra Felix, Jacek Kowalski, was compelled to ink an act of absolute surrender. Ancient Rome, renowned not for clemency but for its harsh treatment of war-bound captives, left Kowalski anticipating the direst of fates. Yet, as often occurs, a destiny more grievous than death loomed - public humiliation. And so it arrived, heralded by the entrance of the Calisian Emperor, Ricardus Calisius, to celebrate his triumph in Środa Wielkopolska, officially renamed Mercuria Maior.\n\nThe townsfolk, estranged from Kowalski's hegemonic rule emanating from his ancestral Kórnik, poured onto the streets to hail their liberators, no matter how unfamiliar. Having endured a regression to the opulent aristocratic past of the golden era of the Polish nobility, they now traversed even further back in time. The market square of Mercuria was decorated in a manner never before seen in the town's history. The multitude of banners, standards, and imperial symbols created an impression of immense splendor, and the nearby stadium was filled with fireworks to enhance the entire event.\n\nThe Emperor's entry elicited resounding cheers from the legionaries, met with warm smiles and regal salutations from Ricardus as he passed in his gilded chariot. Behind him trailed the Praetorians, driving a chariot carrying an iron cage, wherein lay the vanquished and humbled Kowalski. It was a sad sight, and the professor-hetman was further demoralized by the fact that the people were so joyous at his downfall. As they cheered with thunderous applause, they had not known they traded their golden liberty for the Emperor's whip.\n\nIn the very market square during Emperor Ricardus's speech, the crowd began to warm up to their new sovereign. The discourse concluded not with discord but with harmony - a symphony that transcended the exuberance of the Jarocin Festival. Guarded by sentinels, Kowalski ascended the stage to intone, in Latin's lyrical embrace, the verses of a song:\n\n- Per Poloniam gradiens durus passus legionum tonat..."

Some of the men had Andean-style caps - the kind which, in better times, was associated with then-prime minister Tusk. Others sported makeshift helmets and silvery fishscale overalls, which, apparently - were supposed to resemble lamellar armor. \n- You bunch of barbarian maggots ever heard of thermae or razors? - the prefect asked. \n- With all due respect, good sire - the leader of the horsemen rode forward - we were not keen on losing our identity and our considerable facial hair under the new government. But, well, as we were recognized as equites of the empire, we, uh, found ourselves in need to adapt. We are still Sarmatians, only the ancient kind. The real one, if you prefer, good sire. \n\nThe silence was as uncomfortable as the lamellar overalls. After a longer while, a young optio broke out. \n- Quintus... Quintus, let yourself get irritated... \n- How am I supposed not to be irritated? \n- Easy, they'll Latinize... \n- They won't Latinize! Nothing will Latinize! I won't get another group of equites like that! We were supposed to recruit a good bunch of horsemen and not some steppe throat singer wannabes! I bet they can't even do a Parthian shot! \n\nAs on command, a few arrows flew toward the Roman delegation. They missed. Quintus thought for a second until his horse tumbled down, and he slammed his face into the mud. The Sarmatian leader rode closer, twirling his mustache."

The gates of the palace were shut, and in each window, a rifleman waited for the command to open fire. \n\nRumour had it a whole legion was sent to capture the estates. How fitting that the Lechitic monarchy was to be ended by its eternal Roman enemies! Or maybe not, the count thought. The cause of the Lechites would be taken up by yet another warlord in some other, mist-swept part of what once was Polonia. There's no need to be dramatic about it. \n\nAs Leszczyński walked through the halls of his palace, he noticed the portrait of his great ancestor, the King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Prince of Lotharingia, Stanisław Leszczyński. His deeds and struggles imbued him with inspiration. The count stopped for a while and pondered. What would Stanisław do? \n\nAnd so, Wojciech Edward I Leszczyński bailed the fuck out of his palace and escaped to France."

calisia.20.desc: "A messenger ran into the main hall hurriedly, almost out of breath. \n\n- Boss, the tax collector's here. He's yapping something about 'protection money.' \n- Again? It's the third time this month. It has to be some mistake. Send him back, and make sure not to give him a penny. \n\nPaweł has seen his fair share of invasions in the years following the Fall. The Germans had just been the start. Since then, rarely has a month passed without some raiding party trying to burn and plunder his lands. So, too, has he grown accustomed to the almost bi-annual occupations. Limanówka has changed hands more times than he could count, and over the multitude of attacks and tyrannical overlords, it has learned how to defend itself. A private garrison, traps surrounding the estate's entire perimeter... far too much trouble for the meager amount of loot stored inside. \n\nThey felt safe. The magnanimous Praetorians must have had some administrative trouble and accidentally sent their official to the wrong place. Paweł expected the emissary to return with an apology. Instead, he had brought an army to their doorstep, set to make an example of anyone who dared defy the Praefectus. \n\nLimanówka put up one hell of a fight. Before the first units reached the perimeter, half of the vanguard had already been dead, while the rest were forced to retreat in shame. But for every fallen legionary, two more joined the fray like a vengeful, thousand-head hydra. With every passing minute, the invaders got closer, disregarding any losses through nearly fanatical iron discipline. Eventually, bullets started to run out for the defenders. Rationing became a necessity. The attackers stepped over the bodies of their slain comrades to continue their relentless push forward until Paweł saw no choice but to wave the white flag. \n\nThe leader of the estate's defenses had been granted mercy. At least that's what the Praetorians called it. Paweł would live to see another day, forced to watch as his entire livelihood burned before him. Whenever the defeated landowner averted his eyes from the bonfire engulfing his home, a crack of the captors' whip set him straight. Left out in the countryside without a single Denarius to his name, he has wandered the land ever since; a restless traveler whiling his final days away. Each month, he returns to Limanówka to pay his respects to his fallen companions and servants. Their lifeless bodies mark the trail to this day, hanging from the roadside crosses in a grim reminder of what happens to anyone who dares cross the Praetorians."

Despite being chairman of Jarocin's municipal council, he did not complain about an excess of cash. One - he was just an executor of the orders of the Eurokommissariat authorities, two - at the time of the economic crisis, the central government was cutting spending wherever it could, and the weak subordinate administration could not even object loudly. He survived the last few months on potatoes and onions. And now, damn it, it was like paradise. Those Calisians in ridiculous armor kept him in office, only requiring him to wear a toga at work thanks to their new law named Constiutio Calisiana. They increased his salary, and tomatoes, crisp bread, rapeseed oil, balsamic apple vinegar, and, most importantly, wine was back on the table. Imported from Bulgaria but called Thracian. Janusz had not felt such pride for a long time as he did at the recent party to celebrate his 45th birthday. He saw the faces of all those lower officials or his old friends now digging ditches to survive, amazed at the antique splendor of his villa. He had to explain many things to them in person - that it is not appropriate to eat sitting down but lying down, that wine should be diluted (but, of course, this only applied to guests,) and that balsamic vinegar was not for drinking. Well, they were aware of this, but it didn't hurt to remind them. After all, these were barbarians barely touched by civilization. Janusz thought, with a smile on his lips, about all those pathetic attempts to Latinize names - some Tomasz once referred to himself as Tomcus, another time as Tomasius, etc. Meanwhile, his name - Ianus - sounded suitably dignified and Calisian without any quaintness. Chairman of the municipal council. He still had to learn a bit of Latin, but he had already memorized one sentence and used it frequently:"

You know it's no big deal. I only hope the spectacle lives up to the expectations. - The matron responded with a noticeable hint of pride at her newfound status. The regal lifestyle suited her, and the constant aggressive flaunting of her wealth has since opened nearly every door within the Empire. \n- Now don't you worry about that. I had a little... chat with one of the Lanistas. They're bringing in fresh blood. Captured barbarians. You know what that means, right? \n- Of course.

You wanted action, and we're here to deliver. Get ready to witness brave combatants and fearsome beasts locked in a fight for life, death, and freedom! And now, starting us off, watch as a band of loathsome brigands takes on a pack of ravenous Carpathian wolves! \n\nSzymon's fight had been the fifth of the evening. Images of destruction clouded his mind. His family, dead at the hands of the same monsters he was now to entertain. Rage seeped through his whole body. The second the signal sounded for the round to begin, he rushed towards his opponent. His partially rusted gladius was no match for the local champion's carefully maintained armor, but he cared not. If he was to die, he might as well get his last act of revenge. A precise strike slashed Szymon's arm. He felt no pain, even as the weapon pierced his flesh deeply. This was his opportunity. He lunged at his adversary, pushing past his defenses and stabbing him repeatedly until only a lifeless husk of the former gladiator remained on the ground. \n\nEventually, exhausted, the victor stood to face the frenzied crowd. He had fuelled their bloodlust, and though all that mattered to him was vengeance, he awaited his freedom nonetheless. \n\n- The Emperor has decreed death! - the announcer's jubilant voice exclaimed. \n\n Amidst the buzz and rushing adrenaline, Szymon never even got to hear his sentence. Triumphant, he took in the faces of his tormentors, eyeing them with contempt. He knew he'd return one day to enact revenge on each and every last one of them. \n\nA searing pain interrupted his thoughts. He fell to his knees. Everything went black..."

After decades of decay, Poland and its culture have become associated with the worst kinds of moral corruption. The Emperor offered a new path forward, wrought with all the decorum and glamour of the classical golden age. Sebastianus embraced this vision wholeheartedly, his literary efforts supporting Calisia in its direst time of need. For his loyalty, he was to be rewarded. \n\nEver since receiving his senatorial mandate, Sebastianus could barely get a full night's rest in excitement. The prospect of squaring up against Cicero's spiritual descendants in the finest examples of rhetorical theater motivated him like nothing else. He spent nearly all his free time musing about imagined discussions and writing speeches that were to grip both hearts and minds. On the long-awaited day of his official introduction to the chamber, with a glint in his eye and a spring in his step, the young deputy made his way to the richly adorned marble structure that was to be his second home for the remainder of the term. \n\nThough he had seen the building almost daily, Sebastianus could hardly decide whether it was more breathtaking from the outside or the inside. For him, the senate was an island of civilization in the endless sea of barbarism. Each clack of the floortiles evoked a new dream of reclaiming the sense of civility lost over the centuries. He reached the ornate doors of the chamber. He was ready. Or so he thought. \n\n- JUNO'S CUNT, ANDREAS - YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THAT WOULD MAKE YOU STUPIDER THAN THE AVENTINE DONKEY. NOT THAT YOU QUALIFY EVEN FOR BEING AN AMOEBA, MIND YOU. \n- LOOK WHO'S TALKING, PETRUS - BUNCH OF THIEVES AND EXPLOITERS, ALL OF YOU! BEST WE COULD DO IS NAIL YOUR CORRUPT HANDS TO THE SENATE DOORS. \n\nThese words caused the crowd of senators to go completely livid. Or maybe it was the shoe thrown by one of the Optimates. Either way, it's good that the lictors had gone away because otherwise, Petrus Caletus would surely have used one of their fasces to beat the raging populares out of the building. \n\nAnd in the corner of it all, Sebastianus stood, speechless, mouth agape. Civilization had truly fallen, and Calisia was the center of its demise. Ignoring the commotion, he staggered towards his seat, resigned. These are bound to be some awfully long years."

However, history teaches us that feudal relationships are fragile, and personal conflicts among vassals can tear apart even the most powerful kingdoms from within. The rulers of Konin proved to lack significant loyalty to their sovereign ruler, and their quick shift in allegiance was sealed with a few privileges and secret rewards from the ruling faction of Calisia. This is also why the city itself avoided the consequences of devastating warfare - they simply turned cloaks.\n\nAnd it is from the lands of the horsemasters that Calisia can benefit by developing its cavalry skills, which will undoubtedly come in handy in their inevitable war with the Sarmatian hordes. Utility to the imperial machine often determines survival in the new system, and Konin has attained this honor. A triumph in the city took place - but it was not a parade of conquerors over a humiliated city; it was a symbolic handshake between the oppressed vassals and their liberators, who will make them not prisoners, but partners.\n\nTherefore, when Emperor Ricardus arrived in the city, he looked as if he were attending a campaign rally from his pre-Fall parliamentary career. Handshakes, abundant stalls with local delicacies, a festive atmosphere, music, singing, and dancing. The Konin triumph starkly contrasted with the other, more somber scenes seen during the unification wars. If only most of the population had the same attitude as this new province of Calisia - Equestria..."

calisia.26.t: "Bibulous Musings"
calisia.26.desc: "As shades of orange, pink, and blue clashed on the evening sky, and the first stars prepared to brighten up the coming night, the Emperor lounged on the balcony of his Imperial Palace, looking over the city with a glass of wine in hand. It was his place of solace, away from the constant squabbles of the senate, plights of the people, and especially the unending tug-of-war between the Empire's factions. He often found himself frequenting this spot whenever the burden of ruling Calisia overwhelmed him. Usually, turning to his worst habits was merely an escape for Ricardus, but this time, he had a good reason to feel accomplished. His improbable statelet had burgeoned into a regional powerhouse, stretching all the way from the Kuyavian Lakelands to the Silesian highlands. And yet, he was uneasy. \n\nDeep swig. Another glass. Another memory. A nation forsaken. A hopeless dream beyond reach. \n\nA growing doubt sullied the Emperor's celebration. What had he truly accomplished? Built a state more dysfunctional than any of its predecessors? Calisia may appear to be a colossus, but internally, it was already crumbling. Discord among the four main power blocks turned what was meant to be an organized leadership into a corrupt network of shifting alliances. Should their animosity towards each other grow, they could rip the country to pieces, and he'd be none the wiser. If anything, expanding the disintegrating administration across the entire voivodeship was bound to only lead to more problems. \n\nAnother gulp. This one didn't go down as easily. Ricardus grimaced. A new memory flooded him. A performance. A farce. \n\nHe gazed at the city below, stretching past the horizon. Even in his current state, he could clearly recognize its shortcomings. Provincial at best, its mere sight was enough to dispel any notions of imperial glory. The 'Eternal City' was as poor of an imitation as the Empire itself - a trace of purple paint over a reality no different than before. How long could the facade hold? \n\nA sigh. A few more sips. The bottle had been emptied. The second of the night. A madman. His sacrifice. \n\nHe could see it clearly now - a bustling metropolis of white marble sprawling before him. Old tenements making way for great projects and architectural wonders as far as the eye can see. A harmonious senate presiding over the nation's wellbeing. The strata intermingling, enjoying a new age of prosperity for noblemen and commoners alike. The imperial banner waving across all of Poland. His glorious Calisia... Invicta."

calisia.27.t: "Between Two Grindstones"
calisia.27.desc: "Ever since he became a Calisian citizen and decided to involve himself with the politics of the Res Publica, the former Alderman has found himself torn between two worlds. Neither of them sounded too interesting to him, strengthened only by their incessant pestering.\n\nOne day, it would be one of the Populares' senators, Iacobinus, come to visit with a bottle of vodka or wine, asking to share it with him. Another, it would be Caletus, come to debate him on politics before getting frustrated and leaving in a huff. Then Compa, to apologize for Iacobinus having thrown up on the carpet and discuss Byzantine history and how it could be applied to Calisia.\n\nThen, every once in a while, he'd receive a package in the mail, very obviously meant to entreat him into joining either side. At this point, he was running out of space to display all the sets of silverware, weird memorabilia loosely related to Rota, teddy bears dressed in purple and red togas, and god forbid the number of chocolate boxes that tasted like chalk.\n\nOn some level, he appreciated the respect they were giving him, but oftentimes, it felt like it was way too much. On one instance, Compa and Caletus somehow managed to sync up their visits, making for a very awkward meeting over a cup of tea. Ilski, now known as Flavius, could tell the two were just waiting for the perfect moment to rip one another to shreds.\n\nNormally, he would be content with serving as a middle ground, but participation in the Senate wasn't that easy. Despite membership in one of the two parties not being technically necessary, in practice, you wouldn't get far if one couldn't picture you in red or purple, under the auroch or the lynx. He needed to make a choice at some point.\n\nThough the incident that would eventually push him over the edge would eventually be one of those cards you'd give someone on their birthday. Well, two of them. One written collectively by the Populares and one by the Optimates. Both arriving on the same day.\n\nBy which point, Flavius gave in. He really couldn't take this \"pampering\" any longer. One more corny gift, and he would lose his mind. He sat down with a piece of paper and started writing."

calisia.28.desc: "The drawn-out process of political tug-of-war around the Lex Ager Publicus has ground the warring camps into a tense standstill. As the initial fervor dissipated and the issue turned into a slow burn, doubt began to grow among Andrzej's band whether, far beyond their reach, the Optimates might slowly be tipping the scales. As for his own part, Paulus was hard at work in the capital, greasing the wheels of democracy with a few essential bribes, favors, and the like. Despite the significant intake of new senators, it proved just as easy to ingratiate himself with the rank-and-file Senators, including pulling along a few of the more... agreeable Populares. Though a lot of time had passed since he last had to utilize his influence, one rule still held true within the halls of power - money does the talking, and there are no limits as to what it can achieve. \n\nAs they camped in their master's estate, slowly running out of what little provisions they had stocked up for their rebellion, all the peasants could do was hope that somehow the initial majority would hold. Was there even ever a majority? At this point, they didn't know whether that was their paranoia or what remained of their rational senses lingering in the backs of their minds. It felt like weeks, months, even, perhaps, for them, nearly like an eternity, but a revolution does not waver. Though all they did was sit idly within the confines of a single property, the revolters styled themselves as commissars of a rapidly approaching global overthrow of the entrenched oligarchy. With each day, they sank further into delusions of grandeur, possibly impacted by their malnourished delirium. \n\nIn a way, the noise of their master's chariot finally returning was cathartic, an end to the torturous uncertainty. They quickly ran to the front porch to confront the man they so strongly reviled. \n- Tyrant! Come to formalize your surrender? In the name of the Free People's Commune of Studzianka, I vow to grant you mercy and let you escape with one item of your choosing should you agree to cooperate. \n- Oh, stop wasting my time, Andrzej. - He tossed him a piece of parchment, nearly hitting his leg in the process. - Read this to the rest of your misfits. It's the bill that just got passed in the Senate. With my significant help, I'd like to add. It's over. Now get back in the field AND EARN BACK EVERY SINGLE DENARIUS YOU COST ME! \nAs he read the contents of the document, the smug dominance of the serf increasingly gave way to a look of utter fear. As if struck by lightning, he dropped to his knees, pleading with his owner to refrain from the vengeance he desired.- Y... yes, master, we are sorry for our lapse in judgment. At once. - He responded humbly, bowing his head. He knew that for the rest of time, the whip would seek out his back on a daily, if not hourly basis."

calisia.29.t: "Libertas Universalis"
calisia.29.desc: "The weeks of debate surrounding the Ager Publicus reform have been disastrous for Paulus, to say the least. While he was preoccupied in the capital, throwing money at every senator he could possibly sway to his cause, Andrzej's merry band occupied their master's estate. The landholder knew the situation was dire. The peasants have cut off his main income source, and his pockets have been drying up at an alarming rate. A bribe for some wavering centrists here, a gift for a few volatile Optimates there; it was all costly, but he could always make the denarii back once all goes back to normal. The ungrateful serfs will work double shifts until the loss is fully repaid. And oh, he'll make them pay. \n\nWhen the voting neared, and he was sent back to his manor, Paulus could only hope he had done enough. The confidential letters he was being sent left and right from both sides of the aisle proved he had a considerable majority, perhaps even one too substantial to even be true. He peered through the correspondence, marking every declaration of support on a crumpled piece of paper. Nearly eighty Senators committed to vote along with his interests, every single Optimate, most of the Populares, even a few of the hardliners... Has he overdone it? The landowner began regretting a few of the more panicked donations. \n\nAfter arriving at his estate and briefly making camp in the secondary quarters, Paulus greeted the incoming officer with visible elation. He wasn't really the brutish, military type the oligarch expected, but if he could scare off the peasants into complicity, there was no reason to complain. All was set for the eventual confrontation, as seeing the commotion, the rebels emerged out of the mansion, one by one, awaiting their fate. \n\n- Hmm, okay, how many of you are there? About thirty, yes? - the official began in a bored, administrative tone. \n- Thirty-two, Sir. And we ain't moving. This is our land now! \n\nIgnoring the bickering sides barraging one another with expletives too obscene to document in his final report, the bureaucrat brought out his measuring instruments, circled the entire property, and eventually carved out and delineated a small back corner of the land with an apple tree and two dead shrubs. \n\n- Okay, Mr. Stericus, this plot will be for you. I can send someone over to help you move your property. \n- MY plot? This is the thanks I get for singlehandedly helping those ungrateful bastards kill the reform? They should be showering me with gifts! Tell me right now that they're giving me better land as compensation! I demand an estate by the Prosna! Prebuilt, and with servants that aren't this damn uppity! \n- Umm, yeah, hate to break it to you, Sir..."

calisia.30.desc: "Urbs Calisia was waking from its sleep. As people were readying themselves for work under the shy shine of the morning sun, Imperator Ricardus Calisius was suffering from a massive headache.\n - I hope to figure out what to do with those new lands; otherwise, I'll have to suffer more boozy audiences from both factions. And I don't think that even Bacchus could survive that! - Calisius's brain was struggling to formulate any thoughts - I need to eat something.\nHe quickly realized in his drunkenness that he let the cooks have a holiday, and his guest left no leftovers after the last night.\n- *Futuere*.  That means I'll have to go and buy some things.\nHe put on a linen tunic and simple wooden sandals. He didn't want to diminish the glory of emperorship by going outside intoxicated. And, even more importantly, he didn't want any brownnoses praising him publicly. He just wanted to have a peaceful breakfast and return to his palace to get better.\n\nIt wasn't long after he left the complex that the green sign of a Ranula shop attracted his attention. He quickly headed its way and entered.\n - I'm sorry - the Ranula clerk said after he requested a hot dog - We've just opened, and hillae calentes are not ready yet. You'll have to wait.\n - Fine. - Calisius replied and went outside to get some fresh air to mitigate his hangover.\nSoon after, a local hobo approached him.\n - Hey, have you seen my buddy Ulysses? He was supposed to go find us a drink, but he disappeared... Hey, you're that Calisius Emperor guy.\n - No, you must be mistaken.\n - AVE CAESAR - the hobo didn't care or didn't hear him as he performed a Roman salute. The *wrong* Roman salute.\n- Quiet! I don't want to be recognized. What's your name - he tried to steer the conversation away from his identity.\n- Name? I don't remember. They just call me a 'menel...' Ugh, my head. - Looks like Calisius wasn't the only one preoccupied with 'negotiations'.\n - He must be Menelaos. - Calisius thought to himself - that would explain the fiery red hair.\n - Anyway, - he rambled despite the pain. - You know how I'd rule? - he didn't wait for an answer - I'd get rid of the barbarians. Or their bosses. To get their money. And with it, I'd build a... monument of myself and maybe fix the damn holes in the roads. Roman stuff, eh? Buy the same equipment for the soldiers so they can hack any rebellious barbarians. Whaddya think?"

When it occurred, the parishioners of Urusulus went out and conspired to save as much money as they could. They sent their envoys to the priest. \n\n- Father! - They said. - We know that you are honest and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You seek favor from no one because you pay no attention to pagan rituals. So tell us what you think: Is it right to donate the new money for the collection tray? \n\nThe priest saw their good intent and said: - Well, there is no need to withhold it from me. Show me the coin you want to donate. \n\nAnd they brought him a denarius. - Whose image is this? - The priest asked. - And whose inscription? \n\n- The Emperor's. - They answered. \n\n - Are you sure? He looks kind of thin. Anyway, it will do. \n\nAnd then, the parishioners said: - But father, did Jesus not say we should render unto Caesar what is Caesar's? - So they left him and went away. \n\n- Terribly clever of you! -  The priest shouted after them. - The Emperor won't see a single one of these coins!

calisia.32.desc: "It was Premislaus' idea from the start. He was a quick thinker, that guy. Working on fixing up the heavily damaged A-II Autovia was one exhausting job by all means, so what is there to do to kill the time? Three crates of the cheapest wine you could possibly get, of course! The work site is so far off from the Urbs, or just about anywhere with a pre-Fall population of over a thousand, that this was practically the perfect crime.\n\nThe smell of melting asphalt really killed the mood, but cheap booze tasted so much better at the worksite, especially in this weather. It might've been diluted spirit with a carton of grape juice and food coloring mixed in, but that's just the thing for a hard-working legionary. This was about the third, maybe fourth time they pulled this stunt. It took the edge off; lubricated the rusty gears of the daily grind. Hell, it even made them feel like working a bit more when they weren't all pissed off at their bosses for sending them to dig holes, fill them with rocks, and flood it with tarmac.\n\nEverything was fine and dandy at the worksite until Conradus, another wise guy, came running down the length of the site from the gap in the noise-canceling barriers waving his hands like a madman, yelling something. Panting and sweating bullets, he was finally close enough to actually be intelligible\n\n - Guys! The fucking inspector is coming! Hide the booze!\n\nIn a panicked rush, all the legionaries sprung into action. They were like clockwork, throwing empty bottles in the bushes and burying the still-corked ones under loose dirt near the wheelbarrows. They all grabbed their shovels or soil compactors and made their best efforts to at least appear as if they were hard at work.\n\nSoon enough, there he was the inspector in his glorious steed - a beat-up Fiat Seicento. He stepped out of his car, which was tiny compared to his circumference. He walked very carefully through the sand and dirt, careful not to get any excess dust on his obscenely expensive robes. He wore a comparatively small badge that proudly stated his very highly esteemed position, which he gained through hard work, as he called it, though everyone knew he was just a sycophant. With a cursory glance, he looked around the worksite, and a small smile crept onto his face. This was probably the first worksite he's seen today that was actually hard at work. They swayed a bit while they worked, but he chalked it up to them being such hard workers. He walked around the site a bit, very nearly missing the pile of dirt covering up the wine, wrote some things down in his notebook, and left as he came in his rusty tin can."

calisia.33.t: "The Great Migration"
calisia.33.desc: "History used to repeat itself, but it never did so consciously. Ideas were regurgitated, repacked in cheap, trashy packaging, and then bought by troubled masses. Mixed-up fantasies about the past and future mangled the minds of men and made the most outrageous outcomes a desirable possibility. Their brunt, physical consequences were skimmed off as flashy displays of B-class movie action and pulp fiction tragedy. n\nOnce Polonia experienced the Fall, a faint thought appeared in the minds of people of the East and West alike that, contrary to the popular saying *something* might indeed happen, and that the end of the world as it was known was an actual possibility. Once Germania and Tartaria embroiled themselves in internal strife and civil war, this thought was widely acknowledged. One day, people did not simply wake up but persisted instead in a fever dream, where everything was possible as long as it kept the stream of consciousness running. \n\nAs waves of refugees moved into the Polonia's successor state known as Calisia, they found themselves in a place somewhat safer but far more bizarre, a form of coping mechanism, therapy, or mass escapism. It did seem helpful - to an extent - but it wasn't for the refugees. These were aliens, numerous, noisy, and downtrodden, disturbing the hard-fought peace - and the coping mechanism found a way to cope with that as well. It branded them as barbarians - non-Calisians, non-citizens, people of lesser civilizations. It sounded bizarre - as everything did. But, first and foremost, it was humiliating. \n\nAnd so the people of Germania Maior and Scythia, people of states fallen and humiliated, reached for a new-old identity. Men of melting pots and multicultural cities revived the quite modern myths of fearsome Teutonic warriors of Teutoburg and the ruthless Vandals; of masters of the steppes and scourges of God. They've banded once again in the middle of the greatest storm Europe had seen since around a century. In this way, they did not have to feel shame or fear when facing these new Romans."

Look at the marble, those huge arches... \n- Well, yes... - Maximus scratched his head. It took him a moment to articulate what he meant.\n - Just tell me, where do you guys want to bring this water from? \nThe builder was suddenly caught off guard. He looked at Maximus and at the aqueduct, soaring up to the clouds. Admittedly, the clouds were quite low that day, but it still meant something. \n- But... what do you mean \nMaximus sighed deeply. \n- Show me the plans according to which you built this. \n\nThe builder ran to the outbuildings and quickly returned with a bundle of documents. Then he opened them one by one and looked through them together with Maximus. \n\n- Oh, here, take a look. You have a master plan here. Now look at what you've fucked up. \n\nThe builder compared the plan with the actual effect, and his face faded a little. \n-Uhh... \n- You have a fucking tunnel on the plan. A canal. The aqueducts were mostly canals. And the ones that weren't canals brought water from the mountains. Look around you and tell me where you see any mountains around here. Or don't. Tell me how the fuck you built this thing instead of a canal? \n- Well, when they came with the order, and we heard they want an aqueduct we thought that... that... \n- That what? \n- That there is no point in looking at the plans because everyone knows what an aqueduct looks like. \n- Bravo, tell me how I'm supposed to get it running now. Tomorrow, the water is supposed to flow through it, the Emperor is supposed to be at the opening - Maximus grabbed his head. He closed his eyes. Enough. There's no need to think too much. Because when you think, you get ahead of the game. You have to act. \n\n- Tiberius! Call the soldiers. Make them take the buckets. \n\nThroughout the next day and all of the following night, the cohort escorting Maximus entered the aqueduct and brought buckets filled with water from the nearby lake. Slowly but steadily, the water began to flow towards Calisia. It ran out at the opening ceremony, and a day later, the entire aqueduct was closed, and a sign was put up next to it - 'Closed, maintenance work in progress.'"

You can see the estimated costs in the corner of the slide, next to the pie chart. Now, excuse me for one second before we continue.\n\nIt had been around an hour and a half now that Flavianus had been presenting data to the board before him. Not a moment to breathe or to take a drink of water as he was doing right now. The pressure emanating from his audience was immense. Monoliths of Calisia they were - Consuls Caletus and Compa, some of the richest patricians in the Urbs, and the Em- well, not the Emperor, but one of his delegates. He was too busy to show up in person, apparently.\n\n - Now then, let's move on to the question of the Imperial Palace... hoo boy... So, according to the blueprints provided to the land surveyor team, an area of roughly 200 by 300 meters would be required for construction. According to the plans, that space would need to be in the city somewhere. This leaves us only with the solution of demolishing houses along...\n\nBefore Flavianus could break the news, Consul Compa interjected, almost standing up in his seat. \n\n - You mean to tell us that we're supposed to evict people from their homes just to build some palace? We have all the countryside free and available.\n\nFlavianus really wasn't prepared for the Consul's onslaught. It felt like his breath was punched out of his chest. Before he could even begin to formulate a response, Consul Caletus turned to Compa with a smug grin.\n\n - But where would the prestige in that be? Do you think that the Emperor would like to walk among the mud and stench of cattle? I personally think not, Andreas. Let the young man talk. \n\n - Petrus, since when are you so bothered with manure? Wasn't it your splendid idea for the Senatorial Villas to be built in the middle of a swamp?\n\nAt this point, the two Consuls were almost standing, Caletus slowly turning red with anger, as Compa stared him down with an unreadable look on his face.\n\n - Andreas! If one more word comes out of your mouth, then I swear to Jupiter I will beat your ass.\n\nBy this point, the Emperor's delegate, along with the other attendees, moved back slightly in his chair, almost sensing what was about to come. Judging by the Consuls now standing at full height, wildly gesturing at one another. Whatever Compa replied to Caletus wasn't even important, as the two wrestled with the conference table, eventually, their combined forces making a part of it crumble entirely, letting the two partake in a brilliant display of Calisian democracy."

Since the entire Senate had to move its deliberations to a temporary building due to the renovation of the old structure, the pain had only intensified. Especially when someone was speaking from the pulpit. And that is exactly what happened now. Senator Bribanus took the barely functioning microphone and began to explain why there should be an increase in the fees for traders on the Forum Calisianum.  The reverberations that spread through the gymnasium of one of the Calisian high schools were striking. The faces of the Senators sitting at the school desks were dominated by grimaces of weariness mixed with resignation. Suddenly, Bribanus interrupted his speech, and one of the Consuls ordered his subordinates to distribute the ballots. This took a good ten minutes. When the voting was over, Senator Compa made a motion for an adjournment to which everyone in the room agreed. \n\nA few moments later, a large group of Senators were already in the toilets enjoying a cigarette. The ladies' room was occupied by the Optimates and the men's room by the Populares. \n\n- Ladies and gentlemen, this cannot go on. - Andreas Compa said, 'How long can this building be in renovation? After all, it feels like we're about to take our finals here. \n- There was nothing better. - replied one of the Populares. \n- All right, hand over the scissors. It's getting stuffy in here. \n\nCompa quickly received them and set to work. As there was no handle in the window, it was necessary to use scissors to poke around inside the mechanism until it clicked and the window could open. Compa, after weeks of doing this exact routine, was skilled enough in this art that he succeeded for the first time. From behind the barred window, crisp air entered the room, diluting the smoke-filled atmosphere."

Meanwhile, we have plenty of barbarians not sufficiently grateful for the privilege of staying in more civilized lands.

Beat it, this ain't your turf!\n- Or fucking what?\n- Or this guy here will beat the shit out of you like it's the battle of Alesia. - Valus pointed at Damianus. \nBut that didn't faze the patrons; after all, there were four of them and only three of our boys. And the street code... Well, either way, they had the numbers. Situations like this never end well. Or peacefully.\n\nWhen two fight, the third benefits, but this time, nobody did, especially not the city's society.\nAnother beautiful day in the Calisian hoods was coming to an end. A brawl in the club, a few teeth knocked out, some chariots stolen, and vandalized block walls. Some drunk wrecked the street signs again, and the cops showed up long after everyone was gone."

calisia.39.desc: "In an old, quiet house sat the Boreico family. They were refugees from Posnania. They fled from the fanatics of New Zion to Calisia, where they settled in an abandoned building. They didn't particularly bother anyone because they weren't particularly fond of other people either. They preferred their own company, which they considered to be the only one on the right level. \n- Silentium! - said the grandfather to a child who was mumbling too loudly. - Mr. Grandfather, Plenus venter non studet libenter, please note that The Master has deigned to write: \n\nA murmur broke forth, then a bustle and a merry cry \nAs in an empty hive when the bees into it fly. \nIt was a sign that the guests from the hunt were returning, \nand the servants a breakfast for their masters were churning. \n\n- Bravo! - Said the grandfather and gave the boy a slice of bread as a reward. \n\nSuddenly, the door to the house opened with a bang. Or, to be more precise, it fell to the ground under the pressure of several large soldiers. The first one to enter was a strange man in a white toga, who, as if nothing had happened, started drawing a straight line with chalk on the door and then on the floor. He then stood in the middle of the living room, looked around with his tongue outstretched, and then shouted: \nGet me that table out of here at once! \n\nThe soldiers quickly obeyed, throwing the modestly set table out of the window. Surprised, the family, still with cutlery in hand, did not even get up from their chairs. Then, the father decided to speak up. \n\n- What is going on here, cui bono? \n\nThe short man, without stopping, drawing a line where the table used to stand, replied: \n- What's the confusion? The Emperor's Palace is going to stand here. Oh, and here, there will be a palm tree. And there, by that palm tree, will be a great avenue with lots of statues! An avenue named after a multitude of statues! And there - gardens. You know, fig-trees, banana trees, date palms, weeping willows, birch trees... And there - the palace! Huge, spacious, such comfort! And a courtyard full of dancers, and they'll all be dancing like thissss! - The architect stood up and swung his hips joyfully. - And here... a tiny geranium. Yes. The best. Full-on geraniums. Have a bit of imagination! \n - But we have... \n- Gentlemen, take these chairs outside. The army's waiting for you. \n\nThe soldiers quickly carried the seats out, together with the shocked household members. \n\n- Strange people, not so rustic.  - Thought the architect, continuing to demarcate the future palace walls."

Around him stood several stout soldiers in calico armor who watched his work with great attention. \n\n- God, what tempted me to come here? - he thought. - I could have realized earlier that something was wrong here. First, the pay was supposed to be in euros and then in some denarii or other sesterces. Apparently, Eastern Europe has its own strange currencies. And after my recent adventures in Monaco, I really needed money... and a safe place to hide. How naive I was... \n\n- How much longer are we going to wait? - growled someone from the line of workers stretching far away. \n- Non, non! It'll be ready soon - he said nervously so that everyone could hear. \n\nDamn, I was only supposed to survey the land to see if it was suitable for the construction of some palace. And these idiots told me to prepare a drink that gives you superhuman strength. After all, this is sick. How can they live here like this? \n\nLouis added a handful of thyme to the boiling broth. He had never been a particularly good cook, but now he had to get creative to save his skin. So, he made the only soup he knew - cabbage soup. He only hoped that before the workers and soldiers realized that he was making a fool of them, he would be able to run out of town. \n\n- Ermmm... ready! - he shouted uncertainly. \n- Is it done yet? - growled one of the soldiers - what's the magic in this? No incantations or other Gaulish spells? \n- Uhh, oh, right, on it. I forgot one thing, heh. \n\nThe aging surveyor's sweat dripped down his forehead. Think Louis, think... \n\n- Auauauauauauauauauauuauauau - he stammered, waving his arms around the cauldron. \n- Umm, now ready! \n\nWithout batting an eye, the workers set off with small bowls in their hands to get their portions. Louis poured the first one some cabbage soup. After drinking it, the laborer jumped up wildly, waving his arms, and took off, full sprint, to the construction site. The cook watched with bulging eyes as he picked up a wheelbarrow full of rubble and went about emptying it with little effort."

Sebastianus, you first for the warm-up. Sing me a tune to accompany the setting of the marble blocks. \nThe student closed his eyes to concentrate, then slowly began to sing: \n\nPer tuos oculos virides, \nAmore insanio, \nOmnia nocte de te somnio, \nOculi tui lucent tam suaviter \n\n- Well, Sebus, it would have been a five if not for one fundamental mistake. This is a song for laying hollow blocks, not marble blocks. Think again, don't rush... \n\nSebastianus closed his eyes again, pressed his lips together, and strained his mind. Suddenly, he opened them wide and sang out: \nEs insana, dico tibi. \nSemper non fuisti, somniare desine tandem \nNon es angelus, dico tibi. \nEs insana. Es insana. \n\nClaudinus smiled broadly and applauded his pupil's efforts. \n\n- Bravo, perfect. You got an A for your answer. And this is how it should be. You must know the classics because your success in life depends on it. Okay, next person. Lucretia, tell me - what do you have to do when you see a pretty boy walking past while you're working? \n- Simple, whistle. \n- Okay, and why? \n- Because that's what tradition says, Mr Tinker. \n\nClaudinus could hardly hide his pride. Maybe the new times brought changes, corrections, and currents, but thanks to his efforts, the work of the previous generations of builders did not die but flourished. He had no doubt that it was such diligent students who would perpetuate the glory of Calisia forever and ever. After all, they have all the necessary predispositions to do so."

They were wearing plain clothes instead of togas or tunics and, horror of horrors, full boots instead of sandals. \n\n- Damned newcomers - he growled - they're just getting dirt everywhere with their boots. - Barbarians... THIS IS CALISIA, YOU WALK IN SANDALS HERE!!! - he shouted towards them, threatening them with his fist. They must not have heard him, absorbed by the overwhelming beauty and splendor. \n\nFor there was indeed much to admire. The whole street, not so long ago grey and sad, was now sparkling with marble. From time to time, the clatter of chariots could be heard, while in the Forum Calisianum, for a fee, one could find goods undreamt of even before the fall of the Res Publica Polonica. Somewhere in the distance, there was an Imperial Palace, surpassing everything that had been built in the first, second, and even more so the third Rome. Everyone who came here had no doubt where the heart of this part of the world lay today. But that caused a problem - the splendor meant a lot of outsiders wanted to settle. Horace spit on the pavement but quickly realized what he had done and began to wipe his saliva off with a rag. \n\n- Damned visitors, it's all their fault. They dirty, stink, smother, disgust, eh... It took so much effort just for them to ruin everything. And they won't even say Salve to me, a native citizen of the Empire and the Eternal City. What customs. It drives you crazy. It's a good thing that gladiatorial combat is coming soon. The last time a football club did badly, the fans sent them to the arena. At least there will be some entertainment in this sad life. Apparently, they even allowed the sale of diluted wine in the stands."

calisia.43.desc: "Miete... umm, Exuperantius was seated on a marble bench. In his hand, he held a jug with cheap wine freshly poured into it. As befits a hob... an unemployed plebeian, he was not particularly concerned with all this war and politics. Well, a few years ago, bombs fell, and then something happened in the town hall, but for him, this mainly meant that he had to make his own moonshine, like in the old days. He shuddered at the thought. He pulled some sweet wine from the jug to wash away the unpleasant memories. Now that's living. On the street, you can buy wine straight from the oak barrel. The old market square, once run-down, now sparkled with newness. The white-painted concrete looked almost like the marble it sat on. The renewed facades of the old town's buildings were exceedingly impressive to Exuperantius; the beautiful tall columns offered more shelter from the sun than the few surviving trees. But most stunning of all was the town hall. Torn down and built anew with a huge dome in the center, it attracted the eyes of visitors, amazed that such things could be done in a once-ruined country. Exuperantius laid down on a bench, content with his life. Suddenly, he heard something clattering loudly on the cobblestones. He raised his head and barely jumped away from an oncoming chariot harnessed to two horses. The wine jug fell to the ground and shattered with a clatter. \n\n- Excuse me! It's not allowed to fly in front of people's noses like that. This ain't some highway! \n\nAll he heard on his way out was the crack of a whip. Damn, he thought. They made these roads too wide. Now, the young eccentrics are going crazy. The thought crossed his mind to call out a member of the city cohort, but he quickly recanted. After all, he hadn't paid for the wine."

calisia.44.t: "Milites Gloriosi"
calisia.44.desc: "The people cheered as the legions of Calisius marched through the streets of the Eternal City, bathed in the noon's bright sunlight. Legatus Adalbertus Solicovus was leading the parading soldiers towards the platform, with Emperor Ricardus and Legatus Augusti pro praetore Marcus Vinicius awaiting them. For the veteran commander, this was the most desired moment of glory. While Solicovus was the brains behind most of the reforms, Vinicius was the face behind the proposal for increased funds for the project. After all, military campaigns are impossible without political ones. The latter turned out to be equally bloodthirsty, but oh, have they finally borne fruit.\n\nThe soldiers were so close he could already see them in all their glory. The steady march, the functional yet beautiful armor, the carbines, and those roaring monsters - the artillery guns! One could barely remember the time when Vinicius and Solicovus had to first train them. When the few soldiers they had couldn't even form a testudo after gathering enough police shields and trash can covers. By Tartarus, they couldn't even understand orders in Latin. - I think some of those boys from back then are marching in the approaching column! - Vinicius thought to himself, filled with pride as the legionaries neared the planned position.\n\n - Ave Calisius - Solicovus greeted his Emperor.\n - Ave! - the roaring unicity of legionaries answered. Then, the centurions took command of the soldiers, positioning them as two sets of two rows. Solicovus entered the platform. It was time for Vinicius to give the command that would grace the parade even more. - Honorary salute! - he ordered.\n - Legion! - Solicovus proceeded to carry out the order - Attention! Second row - step back, march! Weapon - on the belt! At ease! Honorary salute! With three - load!\n Between the shots, the artillery outside the capital shot their ordinance as well. It was as if Jupiter himself was one of Calisius's faithful soldiers. The crowd cheered! The children were waving their plastic legionary figures, the men were looking as if they wanted to run to the nearest enlistment center, and the women were staring at the manly soldiers... and their handsome leader, of course.\n - Yeah, this is my day - Vinicius concluded."

He was immediately hit in the back of the head by a colleague - Ouch! I mean *testudo*.\n - Correct! I don't know how else I am supposed to speak to you for you to understand! It's your sixth attempt! So I am asking. Really politely. FORM THE DAMN TESTUDO, OR YOU'LL BE CLEANING THE LATRINES FOR THE REST OF YOUR SERVICE!\nThe soldiers were panicking, trying clumsily to get into formation. And they almost succeeded.\n- What the fuck is that?\n- The tortoise you showed us has its head out - said one of the legionaries poking his head out of the formation.\n- Now do a hiding tortoise! - the centurion gave the order while picking up one of the spare helmets and throwing it at the smartass soldier's head.\nThe scared tortoise hid its head, giving the legionaries one last tip regarding the proper look of the formation.\nThe legionary covered his head under the shields, and the Testudo was finally formed.\n- Fucking finally. - Oppidus sighed with relief - Dismissed.\n\n- How the hell did I find myself in this place? - Adalbertus Solicovus was watching the whole farce from his tent. - A bunch of amateurs led by amateurs. And madmen.\nNo formal education, no method, just trying to reinvent the wheel. He was partially to blame for this. When he came to Calisia with a few faithful soldiers to fortify it against the Germanic invaders, he could've stopped this madness. But his inaction enabled Vinicius to prove himself as a leader. Even though that overpraised legate's main assets are nothing but luck and charisma. After the successful raids, even Solicovus's own men became supporters of Legatus Marcus Vinicius, the man responsible for the Empire's military doctrine. Add to that his distaste for politics and Roman antics, and here we are.\n - Now, manipulus formation! - the centurion decided his squad had enough leisure.\nUnable to turn back the tide of history, Solicovus has to live with his mistakes and try to make the most of the situation he found himself in, hoping Vinicius will continue to listen to him, do his job, and see this faux-Roman project to the end. And if he stumbles, well, it shouldn't be too hard for Adalbertus to find employment elsewhere."

But an order is an order, and if the Emperor himself is going to be at your parade, you can't just refuse.\n\n- Look, Andreas, they're coming! Look at those beauties! Brand new, never flown before! - Emperor Ricardius, along with the rest of the VIPs, had the best view of the incoming formations of jets from his podium. At one point, the Aircraft broke formation and began to swirl among each other, creating a fantastic spectacle in the sky.\n- Think about how long you must train to be able to perform such pirouettes without any problems!\n\nMeanwhile, chaos reigned on the radio frequency of the pilots in the first formation. Under no circumstances were their aerial acrobatics part of the planned scenario for the audience.\n- RED FIVE, VEER LEFT!\n- GET OFF MY TAIL, YELLOW THREE-SEVEN!\n- IS ANYONE FLYING BELOW ME? I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING!\n\nAnd Ricardus Calisius was having a great time.\n- You know, this is an art too. Look, they even formed an eagle there! Wonderful, see, that one is even releasing some smoke from the back. Oh, such control. They missed each other by an inch!\n\n- THIS IS GROUND CONTROL, RETURN TO FORMATION, DAMN IT!\n- OKAY, SOLDIERS - TESTUDO!\n- CAPTAIN, HOW DO WE DO THE TESTUDO IN THE AIR?\n\nRefreshments and, more importantly, the barbecue had just been brought to the audience.\n- Oh, I think I'll try some of that pork knuckle. When are the drones going to fly?\n\n- PULL UP! PULL UP!\n- FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!\n\nAs the Emperor was consuming the grilled meat products, an explosion occurred behind the stage, far from the city and out of sight of the dignitaries, barely audible over the festival taking place on the ground. One of the pilots had been overwhelmed by the capabilities of piloting a modern aircraft and accidentally ejected. Fortunately, he survived."

Adalbertus! Send a legion there to help. It's time for us to fight back!\n- Fight with whom...?\n- The water! We're fighting the flood, of course. What else?\n- Oh, right... I mean, yes, sir! Ave Imperator!\n\nWhen, after several very long hours, the whole unit was redeployed to the crisis area, they saw that the naval forces of Calisia were already there, trying to steal their thunder. The silent conflict between the different branches of the armed forces was supposed to make them better through competition, but usually ended up with the inflated egos of the commanders being insulted and forcing them to try winning the race called \"Who can give a more stupid order?\".\nThe naval commander Titus Avillus was already the star of the show, barking orders from his trireme to his troops which tried to pour out the water from the streets on their little tiny lifeboats, filling buckets with water and then pouring it back to the sea. Inefficient like Calisian aqueducts, but Legate Adalbertus wasn't about to lose to some naval ingenuity, even if it was doubtful at best. Especially if it was undoubtedly idiotic.\n- Legionarii! Look at the navy boys in their tiny boats! Let us show them who can really be a man! Form the ranks! Single line! - shouted the legate. Soldiers were standing on the beach waiting for the next order. If one remembers correctly, they went here to aid the citizens, not fight with other Calisians. But the mind of a soldier is a curious place where there is no place for doubt and second-guessing.\n- On my signal, attack the water! Let's show Neptune who's the boss!\nAnd then, it happened. The closed minds of legionaries opened up to a world of new possibilities. A murmur spread through the ranks. What the hell are they supposed to do? Really? But as soon as it came, it went away. With the next command, all doubts were erased, and mechanical behaviors took place.\n- CHAAAARGE!\n\nSeeing the legionaries stabbing the water with swords and spears, commander Avillus was shocked at this sacrilege. Neptune was their patron, and he was always right no matter what happened. Floods were only the manifest of his existence, and a puny legate declaring war on the mighty god was too much of an insult.\n- SOUND THE HORNS! WE MAKE LANDFALL! RAMMING SPEED!\n- But dominus, we'll strand the ships!\n- ROOOOOOOOW!\nAnd so they did. They stranded the ships on the beaches, but they showed their superiority to the land army by driving them back from the city. Several soldiers got injured; fortunately, no one died. Although the high command may see it differently when they receive the reports."

We're about to get off. - said the cigar-smoking man to a figure huddled in the shadows. \n\n- Yes, Princeps Ianus. - replied the soldier, then began to unroll the ropes for a controlled descent. \n\nThe commander looked off into the distance, where, at first, an indistinct light began to shine on the horizon. It was getting brighter by the second. They were approaching the mission objective. \n\n- Ladies and Gentlemen, we do not hesitate. We're going in, and we're doing everything just like we did in training. The scheduled mission time is 4 minutes and 30 seconds. The centurion waited a few seconds and looked at his cigar. He took a drag, and the black line drawn on it disappeared under the pressure of the heat. \n\n- Now. \n\nSix silhouettes in black Kevlar armor jumped from either side of the helicopter in an instant. The guard standing on the side did not even notice when his chest was pierced by a pilum. He fell into the water without being noticed by his fellows. The other was pierced by a titanium gladius. The bulletproof vest was no obstacle for him. Then, the same fate befell another seventeen opponents. When the Cohortes Speciales went below deck, not even a minute had passed. \n\nWhen they were close to their target, they suddenly heard the alarm sound. Several guards armed with automatic weapons jumped out at them. \n\n- Testudo! - growled the centurion, and all six unfolded the hitherto assembled compact fiberglass shields. After a few seconds, the enemies had exhausted all their ammunition without even scratching the scutum. And the gladiuses made them silent forever. \n\n- 'Excellent,' thought Ianus, glancing out of the corner of his eye at a not even half-smoked cigar. He opened the door to one of the cabins with a kick and grabbed a bundle of documents. He placed an explosive charge under the desk. \n\n- We got what we came for. Let's go. - As he ordered, so they did. The guards barely delayed them. Once they had settled into the helicopter, they were hit by a wave of heat, while a powerful glow of conflagration reached their eyes. Ianus smiled and spat the now fully-smoked cigar into the sea."

Will white a bread bun do?\nRicardus was standing in line at Ranula's store like any ordinary citizen. But what he heard felt like a slap in the face. After all, he's on a diet and can't eat wheat bread. In fact, he's on three diets because one doesn't meet the caloric requirements, but still - dark bread is sacred.\n- How can there be none? Don't you have deliveries?\n- Well... we do. It's just that... honestly, I have no idea if this bread is good. The new calendar kind of... messed up our calculations.\nNot only insolent but also impudent. He wouldn't feed him, and on top of that, he would dare complain about his ruler's political decisions. Ricardus's thoughts were growing increasingly aggressive. Hungry, he wasn't himself, but fortunately, his political experience and composure in crisis situations prevailed.\n\n- Alright, in that case, I'll take the white bread.\nThe expression on the clerk's face showed no emotion, but inside his head, an apocalypse was unfolding. He knew that what he was about to say would mean spending the next weekend fighting in the Colosseum instead of resting comfortably at his plot in Colubrega. Despite everything, he took the risk.\n- There's none at all. The sausages are cold. We can't afford the rent. Vandals have painted the store window for the third time. Last month, I counted fourteen alcohol thefts. The Empire is going down. The Optimates are thieves, and the Populares are idiots.\n\nCalisius had not been this shocked in a long time. News of barbarians didn't frighten him. Reports of murders, kidnappings, and war didn't move him. All of this made him start to question his own existence. Was he losing touch with society? Was he becoming the very thing he swore to destroy? How could there not be a hot dog ready for him? Then, as if Calisius had just had an epiphany, he turned to the cashier:\n- Young man, I swear to you... I shall fix this situation. You're right. We can't afford to be without bread in the Empire.

His route typically took him past a large warehouse where various exotic goods for export were stored, including locally produced wines. Oh, the sweetness of tasting the finest drinks produced by the Empire. However, Iacobinus' wine tastings usually ended with persistent requests for more bottles to confirm the quality of the wine, which often led to a mandatory nap by midday.\n\nThis time, however, something was amiss. There was a palpable tension in the air; the situation felt wrong. Not only was the wine shop closed, but shouts could be heard coming from the riverbank. As a respectable citizen, he went to investigate and save the day. What he saw surpassed his wildest expectations. Workers were pouring wine from the barrels into the river, much to the dismay of the local drunks! Silvius considered joining the protest of the town's riffraff, but suddenly, a better idea came to him. He remembered his rank and entered the nearby warehouse like a knight on a white steed.\n\n- Who is the prefect of this establishment?! - the legate shouted in a commanding voice. A mediocre official, visibly terrified by this unexpected visit, appeared before him.\n- A-ave Augustus, legate. How can we assist you?\n- What is the meaning of this? WHY ARE YOU POURING OUT THE WINE?! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!\n- Honorable legate, with all due respect, we are unable to sell it. We can't export anything because no one can afford to buy our goods anymore. We have to write it off as a loss... so we're disposing of it. What else can we do?\n\nIacobinus' eyes lit up as if he had just received a hobo's dream gift for Christmas. Although, at first, he was unsure if this wasn't merely a dream since he often fantasized about such a situation, the lack of alcohol in his system made him very alert. This was his moment.\n- Oy, chief... fetch a cart. I know exactly what to do with this wine. I will take it into my custody. If you have any wine that needs disposal, bring it to my house. Do you know where I live? No? Well, I will tell you. But remember, this is important because it's an order from the Emperor himself. Not a single drop should be wasted. Otherwise, you know the consequences. Now, bottoms up!\n\nAnd so, the imperial wine reserves were saved by the brave legate. He took on a great responsibility, and his sacrifice would not be forgotten - at least by everyone else, because Iacobinus... certainly won't remember much of it."

Yet every time, the Germans either crashed against the limitanei like waves against rocks or were routed by the nearby centuria of cavalry.\n\nSuch was the case this time when two hundred Germanics crossed the Viadrus River to plunder the villages near the fort of Cedene. The infantry engaged the enemy, holding them until the cavalry could strike. The Calisian cavalry was a formidable force, with their scythed chariots instilling terror among the barbarians, mowing foes down like wheat. A swift charge ended in a complete victory, and the legionaries gathered with the equites near the bridge to celebrate their triumph.\n\n- Hey, we saved your asses again. Maybe you should learn to win battles on your own?\n- Alright, alright, you know what? Why don't you take that chariot of yours and fetch me some wine? The lads are parched.\n- Actually, that's a good idea, comrade. Get a horse. You'll help me carry it.\n\nAt that moment, a dreadful roar pierced the skies, as if seven trumpets had sounded the apocalypse. For the soldiers on the border, the gates of hell had opened, unleashing demonic cohorts on the hunt. Hundreds, then thousands of silhouettes loomed on the horizon. Yet it was not the thousands of barbarian warriors that froze the entire limes. Leading the charge were enormous war beasts, at least several dozen war elephants advancing to obliterate the civilized world. Drums began to play a terrifying rhythm, completing the vision of a catastrophe heading towards the legionaries. Contemplating flight, they knew they were merely reserve soldiers, not seasoned legions. One of the centurions of the equites turned his chariot towards the enemy, donned his helmet, took a deep breath, and commanded:\n- SOLDIERS OF THE EMPIRE, REFORM THE LINE! WE'LL TAKE THEM HEAD-ON! CHAAAAAAAARGE!\n\nAnd so, the riders charged forward, racing headlong into death. The rest of the soldiers knew this was the day they feared when their doom arrived on great beasts to end their lives. Knowing they were already dead no matter what they did, they followed the cavalry in a suicidal charge straight into the abyss, from which none would return."

calisia.53.t: "The Sorest of Losers"
calisia.53.desc: "- And with two laps to go, the chariot of the Calisian athletes remains firmly in the lead over the Veneti's rickety cart! Clearly, our representatives are blessed by Mercury to achieve such speeds! Here they are, once again approaching the Western Bend. Watch how gracefully they round the corner... Oh, it appears that the Calisians have lost traction! They've crashed into the wall! And that means... no, it is impossible! That means they are out of the race! The Veneti have passed them by! They didn't even bother to help out our valiant athletes. They slowed down. They are doing a victory lap! How shameful! Ladies and gentlemen, the Veneti have crossed the finish line, and therefore, technically, they have won! \n\nA disappointed murmur spread through the crowd, and the cheers previously rumbling the stadium's foundation deflated in an instant. While the modest delegation of Veneti supporters, crowded in the only corner that the organizers allowed them, had nearly lost their minds in celebration, furiously banging on their massive drums and nearly wrecking the entirety of their section, the Calisians on the other end struggled to process what had just occurred. Slowly but surely, the crowd utilized their combined brainpower to come to the only natural conclusion that could explain how their champions managed to lose to a team of absolute amateurs. \n- Cheaters! \n- They slipped some oil on the track to make our riders crash! \n- We can't let them get away with this! \n- Have at 'em, lads! \n\nFury spread throughout the stadium as if carefully planted and fostered by the goddess Ira. The joyous atmosphere of the event had completely dissipated, and a flurry of jeers and boos greeted the winners during their victory parade. As the main rider for the Veneti team stepped onto the podium and lifted the trophy in front of the frenzied public, he was struck in the head by one of the hundreds of seats thrown from the stands. When he collapsed unconsciously to the ground with a cut across his entire scalp, all remaining pretenses of civility were cast aside as waves of red shirts crashed into the wall dividing the two teams' supporters. It was a bloodbath. Though the away fans tried to hold the line, all exits were barred, and soon, the mass of bodies pushing into them proved too much to bear... \n\n\nEXCERPT FROM THE SPECIAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS ON THE AFTERMATH OF THE SPARTAKIAD: \nEntries: \nCalisians - 18425 // Veneti - 1627 \nApprehended: \nCalisians - 319 // Veneti - 17 \nHospitalizations: \nCalisians - 109 // Veneti - 541 \nDeaths: \nCalisians -  14 // Veneti - 892 \n\nCONCLUSION - Due to the mutual hatred of the populations, it is strongly advised to avoid organizing any future competitions that involve direct competition between Calisian and Venedic athletes. Any such events are to be classified as high-risk, and a Vigiles patrol should remain on standby. It is of utmost importance that, for the good of the Empire, the planning of the second edition of the Spartakiad is to be immediately canceled."

This is your motivation. This keeps you alive. Inhale. Exhale. Repeat. The opening gate lets in a blinding light from outside. The arena is open. Your time has come. For five seconds, your faith does not leave you. You hear a roar. But it is not a human sound; it belongs to a mighty beast. Moments later, the roar is joined by the cheers of the crowd. You stand at the gate, but you are not given any weapon. This is not an ordinary gladiatorial fight. But you still step out, wanting, at least for a moment, to feel the warmth of the sun's rays on your skin.\n\nOne step forward, another, then a third. One part of the arena is separated from the other. On the opposite side, you see a legionary armed with a pilum. He is rousing the crowd for greater cheers. You don't see any animals yet. The sound of a horn is heard. The soldier on the other side takes aim. A spear flies in your direction. You don't have much room to dodge. It misses. The soldier takes a few steps forward. Another spear is stuck in the ground. There are three left in front of him. You must avoid five. Throw. Miss. The distance between you and the legionary is decreasing. Three to go. Behind you, the gate opens. Two handlers lead a lion on a chain. Your maneuvering space is further reduced. Throw. Miss. \n\nThe lion's chain is loosened even more. You are trapped. Throw. You didn't manage to dodge. A tremendous pain pierces you. You fall on one knee, but you try not to faint. The spear is still lodged in your chest. The crowd cheers. They revel in your suffering. Despite everything, you gather the remnants of your strength. The legionary is preparing for the final throw. You hear the announcer counting the points for the legionary. In front of you lies one of the pilum that missed you. You pick it up with enormous effort. You don't have much time left. Your head starts to spin, and your vision darkens. You thrust the spear at the contestant at the same moment he throws his. You don't know if you hit.\n\nYou fall to the ground. A huge applause sweeps through the arena. The last thing you hear is the crowd demanding the lion be unleashed. The sand you lie on is so warm. The taste of blood in your mouth doesn't even bother you. They didn't lie. Now, you can finally be free. You take your last breath. The lion will finish the job. Fortunately, you will no longer experience the pain of being torn apart. The Elysian Fields are already open to you. Darkness surrounds you. Or is it Hades? You become nothingness. This is the end."

calisia.55.t: "Conventus Subitis"
calisia.55.desc: "Dies Solis, 19:00. A crisis group of five High Quaestors assembled to discuss the ramifications of the new Ricardine Calendar. Since the founding of the Imperium Calisianum, their Quintumvirate has stood as the final authority on all financial matters, often having to hurriedly adjust the budget to plug the money drain caused by some Senator's ill-considered bill. Nothing suggested today's session would be any different. \n\nAs they began poring over the countless ledgers they had already mostly memorized, the most senior of the officials, their Primus Inter Pares, broke the silence to detail the day's agenda. \n\n- Alright, so the Emperor, in his infinite wisdom, has just erased about a decade from the calendar. Guess that only screws up about... every single payment made over that period. No pressure. Any ideas? - His usual commanding tone betrayed a sense of consternation. \n- Hmm, so if the dates are going forward, that means we owe the legions around ten years of salaries. - One of the quaestors barged in before his predecessor could even finish speaking, desperately talking over anyone who tried to get a word in. - But that also means we get all the extra taxes, right? So it balances out? \n- Pretty sure it goes backward, Patricius. So literally none of that is true. \n- Yeah, nah. It's definitely backward. - An official of a particularly canine appearance chimed in. - In that case, they are the ones returning their salaries. \n- Wait, does that include us? \n- Hmm, okay, maybe scratch that then. Or give us an exception. \n- Hold on, if we just erase ten years of our records, then, technically, everybody born in the last decade does not exist yet. \n- It's the other way around, Matthius. - a voice interrupted smugly - If the time moves forward, then they're just older. And need to pay back taxes. \n- No! HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT IS NOT FUCKING MOVING FORWARD! \n\nThough the buildup of tension managed to find its unavoidable release, and the atmosphere remained friendlier than the usual meeting, the increasing desire of the High Quaestors to return to their homes and get some actual sleep before the next week began forced them to at least come up with a compromise good enough not to collapse the Empire's whole administrative and financial systems as soon as the markets opened in the morning. Previously silent, the group's unofficial diplomat gave his own two sesterces on the matter. \n\n- Alright, we aren't going to come up with anything today. Let's just bump the issue down to the local level and have the lower ranks deal with it individually. If something works, we copy it in all the other precincts. \n\nA conflicted murmur spread throughout the room. Everyone involved knew it was an insufficient solution, but it was the best one they were going to get. An agreement was reached, and now, it was time to celebrate it with a few cups of cheap wine."

calisia.56.t: "Language of Violence"
calisia.56.desc: "The former border crossing at the former city of Selpolium had become one of the most volatile points in the entire region. On the German side, Frankfurt had transformed from a town of 50,000 into a sprawling enclave of hundreds of thousands of people fleeing from areas engulfed in anarchy and civil war. Refugee ghettos began to form in the heart of the city, growing larger by the day and pressing eastward. Meanwhile, the unyielding Imperial Border Guard stood watch on the Viadrus River, allowing no one to cross the border, constantly intercepting illegal immigrants attempting to ford the river on their own. Yet, even the reinforced limitanei could not control the waves of refugees clamoring at the gates of Calisia.\n\nToday, a meeting was scheduled on the bridge between a representative of the barbarians and a border post officer, Adalbertus Crudeliter. Adalbertus was calm, having already dismissed numerous German envoys who had come to beg for passage. He expected this encounter to be no different. Ten meters behind him stood two soldiers ready for anything. Approaching him were three tall barbarians. Only one of them stepped forward to Adalbertus and nodded in greeting. The officer pulled a Polish-German phrasebook from his pocket, quickly flipping through the pages to find the right phrase.\n- GUTEN MORGEN - Adalbertus shouted, pleased with himself. Unfortunately, it was five minutes past noon, making the greeting irrelevant.\n- Guten Tag, Herr Offizier- the envoy replied.\n\nThe entire \"conversation\" dragged on painfully long, as each sentence had to be manually translated, making any real dynamic negotiation impossible. Calm and composure gave way to frustration and anger, which began to simmer in the envoy. At Adalbertus's next suggestion that they might return to their homes, the barbarian snapped and shouted,\n- SIE HABEN UNSEREN HÄUSER ZERSTÖRT, WOHIN SOLLTEN WIR GEHEN?\n- Hey, hey, no need to get upset, alright? - Adalbertus's hand briefly landed on the hilt of his gladius. He knew \"Haus\" meant home, but what was \"zerstört\"? He quickly flipped through the dictionary to the \"Z\" section, and what he found made his blood run cold. It means \"Destroy\".\n\n- You... maniac, you've gone too far. You want to destroy? You want to plunder our homes? You'll get what you deserve! Men, seize them!\nWith these words, the Calisians lunged at the bewildered Germans, who had no idea what was happening. They tried to defend themselves, but this only convinced the legionaries that the barbarians intended to attack them. After killing the three envoys, Adalbertus ran to the post, raising the general alarm along the entire border. Observing from the other side of the river, the refugees were stunned, but not for long. What followed was an enormous surge of fury from the crowd, which charged straight at the post. Shots were fired. This small misunderstanding was about to change the course of history."

calisia.57.t: "Vinicius' Plea"
calisia.57.desc: "- Marcus Vinicius has come to visit you - a voice broke through the calm sound of flowing water. Ricardus Calisius wiped his glasses from the steam. A man in legionary armor walked through his private thermae towards the tepidarium, where he currently lounged. \n- Ave, Caesar. May all the gods grant you fortune, especially Asclepius and Cipride. \nThe Emperor grumbled. - Of all the gods, why would you think I need Cypride the most? Do I look like I would be in need of her assistance? - he rose from the pool, extending his arms to present the nuda veritas of his outward appearance. - Don't you feel like we've had this exact conversation before? \n- My apologies, o Emperor. This was like... an involuntary reaction to this situation. I could really use a longer stay in the thermae myself. \n- Oh Marcus, you know you can use my thermae whenever you need - Calisius gave him a wry smile. \n- You're as gracious as ever, my Emperor. - Vinicius bowed sharply. - Forgive me, for I have to refuse. I'm entirely overtaken by military matters. \n- Surely you could lend your duties to your assistants for some time. \n- It is not possible. All officers are constantly occupied. We're understaffed in all positions, and men are taking leaves en masse. They don't want to stay in camp on their meager pay while they could work at home. \n- It would be wiser for them to stay on the frontlines. - Calisius nodded, and two servants rushed with a sizeable towel. The Emperor climbed out of the pool and draped himself like he would in a toga. - How much would it take to keep more of them at arms? \n- It's the fault of the system, my Emperor. Our army is designed to be mobilized in full only during the season most appropriate for campaigns. Once it has ended, most of the men ought to go back to the job market or fieldwork, lest we ruin our economy. \n- You know full well we have to work with what we've got. But, I suppose we could pay fewer men full-time if that would ensure better performance. \n- We could turn the legions into a professional force. However, I'm afraid this would create a professional caste of warriors, separate from the rest of our citizens. \n- If you have an alternative to a professional army in mind, voice your opinion - Calisius said drily. \n- We could enroll more non-citizens as auxiliary troops. Allow them to defend Calisia like it was their homeland. This would give them a chance to improve their lot and, perhaps, foster some loyalty. \nThe Emperor gestured vaguely as if thinking of an argument."

calisia.58.t: "Conversatio Privata"
calisia.58.desc: "The office was dimmed, and Cinastovicus' eyes took a while to adapt to the darkness. Ricardus Calisius sat alone, elbows on the desk, fingers intertwined, thumbs holding up his forehead. He had a laurel on his head - which seemed overly theatrical, even for someone like him. \n- Ave, Emperor. You've requested a private conference with me. \n- Sit down, Kinastowski - Calisius gestured to the chair in front of the desk. It was an ordinary office chair, as normal as one could be. As he sat, the Praetorian realized the room was completely unromanised - which only made the sight of the Emperor's toga and his armor somewhat uncomfortable. \n- You are aware of the newest reports, right? - Calisius asked. \n- Of course, my Emperor. I've mobilized the Praetorian guard. They're ready to march out on... \n- I wouldn't call you here just to be briefed on obvious matters. I'm asking you whether you are aware of what is happening. \n- I beg your pardon, sire... \n- If someone five years ago would tell you there's a slave rebellion happening just an hour's drive from your home, what would you do? \n- I was always against terrorism and acts of violence targeted at... \n- No. A *slave* rebellion. Think about it, Christianus. We have *slaves* and now they are killing landowners. You would think I lost my mind if I implied it could happen here and not in some sort of Bantustan or wherever. \nThat's it, Cinastovicus thought. He's actually losing his mind. An impulsive grin appeared on the Praetorian's face, but he collected himself in the blink of an eye. - You must be joking, my Emperor. You're the one who had shown us the way to our current glorious... \n- I did not show the way for an accursed slave rebellion! - Calisius erupted, slamming his fist on the shabby desk. - Who do you think I am? A slave driver for your petty friends to get fat out of this miserable land? This madness has to be fine... - he paused for a while, breathing heavily, adjusting his glasses and, curtly, his laurel. - This has to be corrected. The Populares are calling for abolishing slavery as it is now. I think it's quite sensible as it is. You can surely acknowledge that it's better to have an indentured servant than a slave who's ready to cut your throat. \n- My apologies, o divine Emperor, but now it is too late. These are barbarians; it's in their nature to cut throats. You don't extend a hand to a beast that wants to bite you. Slaves will know their place... - \"or you won't have yours,\" Cinastovicus finished the sentence in his mind. \n- Thankfully, you're not the one who's making all the decisions here. Order the Praetorians to stand easy for now."

Every day a barbarian dick enters your arse and goes back and forth, back and forth like that - the Senators leaving the rostrum gestured. \n- Enough. Enough. Get back to your seat. - The tribune ordered. - We shall now begin the vote on... \n- Formal request, tribune, formal request! - A Popular trotted towards the rostrum, and before the tribune could say anything, started anew. \n- The Optimates have stolen 70 million denarii meant for the legions fighting in the last war! This money went into their villae and offshore bank accounts! According to this document - he took a shabby scroll out of his toga - they spent one million denarii on victuals for the Emperor to placate him, such as: parmesan, spianata romana, mozzarella buffala, and... \n\nThe main door flung open, and the chamber fell silent. The Senators looked with amazement at the majestic silhouette standing in the entrance. \n- I thought I'd drop in for a second to look over the proceedings. - The Emperor said. - Don't mind me. I'm keen to know if I can get any good mozzarella around here. \nThe chamber froze in an uncomfortable silence. Finally, the tribune started mumbling: \n- Maybe we... we could move to the vote on, uhrm... - He fumbled through his papers. - Uhm, where did I put it... \n- Maybe I could share something from my own parliamentary experience. - Calisius said. - First and foremost: don't treat politics as if they were a total war. Tomorrow, you might be forced to work together, or worse - some issue might divide you even further. If you treat yourselves like you're locked in a conflict that has to end with one of you trampled to the floor and proscribed, you will both be sorry losers. My apologies for these trivialities. Some of you might have less political experience. \n\nThe servants brought Calisius a golden stool and a platter with wine and antipasti. \n- As I said, don't mind me.

calisia.73.desc: "- Just stick to the plan, and everything will go smoothly. Alright, let's move out. \n\nThe job was simple: sneak up through the treeline, watch out for any threats, and get out with as many captured women as possible. Then, pack "the loot" onto the trucks waiting in the forest and get away from there before any resistance shows up. \nThe targets resided in the border settlement of Bycz, located near the pre-Fall border between Kuyavia and Greater Poland. \n\nAt first, it seemed like the Amazons had abandoned the village: no armed personnel was in sight, the closest signs of enemy activity being located almost a kilometer away at the small checkpoint set up in Wyrobki. After the drone operator made sure no one was watching them, the men surrounded the village and simultaneously broke into the first few buildings, with the intent of giving the victims the least time to reac... WATCH OUT, MINE! \n\nIn a moment, the entire group was thrown onto the ground by an explosion that ripped away half of plot #30. Immediately after, an entire company of soldieresses jumped the group from two sides and disarmed it in a matter of seconds. Soon after, the invaders were taken to the local fire station, rounded up, knocked out, and stuffed into delivery vans awaiting them in the garages. \n\nNorthern Calisian borderlands, early in the morning. The local garrison's commander has just woken up, teeming with excitement. His boys must have returned with the targets! Oh, how delightful! This calls for a celebration! \n\nThe man got up, put on his comfy clothes, grabbed his wallet, and ventured outside towards the local Supermercatus. Hmm... will it be a couple beers? No, has to be something fancier. OH! How about some rum? Rum with morning coffee sounds nice. Or how about a nice wine? After all, we're Romans now, right? \nAnd so, the jolly commander marched on, wondering to himself what he should pick. As he reached the market's parking, his thoughts lingered around the liquor shelf for a moment. \n\nThat's also where he found his platoon, lying unconscious in their underpants, heads stuffed into the parking's parcel locker."

Forces of order - the few that came in the first place - did not attempt to stop the riot. Instead, they focused their measly forces on escorting two perplexed men from the middle of the square to one of the tenement houses. \n\n- Well... -  mumbled one of them - I never suspected philosophy could move people to such lengths. \n- That's not philosophy, that's alcoholism. - Answered the other. - Still, the fact they did care to listen to the speakers was a surprise. \n- If only they could tune in at some different moment. I'm afraid hearing about the Caracalla edict somewhat agitated them. \n- I wanted to tell you it wasn't prudent to mention that name. It resembles 'karakan' too much. \n- Well, it was bound to happen, then. You can't have a discussion on citizenship without mentioning Caracalla. \n- You could and you should. It was passed centuries after the Roman Empire entrenched itself in the barbarian lands. The people were well romanized by that stage. \n- Oh, but *we* are not well romanised. We have all undergone a very simple transformation within those few years. Now, with our centralized, legitimate government, this process is even faster. \n- Our government barely makes the barbarians bathe once a week. They won't become Calisians in a million years. Not if they actually try to act like us. \n- Look, you're just mistaking the urban culture with a form of Calisian identity. Yes, they may lack the city manners we're accustomed to, but this is just a matter of living conditions and not... \n- Calisians from Calisia built this Empire and no one else. You're trying to imply this all happened because of some kind of fluke? \n- Why would it matter? Weren't we all one people before? Were we not Veneti? Weren't the Romans just one of the Italic tribes in the first place? \n- Veneti, yeah, maybe, maybe they could be Calisians. But barbarians? How could they comprehend this? They started from a way different point than we did, and they don't feel like they're at home, do they? If a Calisian is an evolution of a Venetus, then they should evolve into something of their own. If they could even comprehend that. \n- Don't you think that maybe we could use this opportunity fate gave us? That we have a new-old, pliable culture that can unite everyone, like the Roman culture did? That we can make a better world by creating a whole new home that will finally fit all of us? \n\nFor a second, there was a considerable (as for the fight raging outside) silence. \n- That will fit all of us? Last night, your father said that about your mother when he wanted to join in. \nThere was a crack, and once again, no one on the Forum Calisianum tried to solve problems through discussion."

The shoot was just about to begin, and cameras were aimed at a middle-aged, somewhat unkempt man entering the room. \n\n- No, noo, what the fuck is that? - the director shouted. - Shave that oaf immediately! \nStaff members looked at each other in confusion. \n- What... You mean we should... \n- He has a goddamned mustache! He looks like a barbarian! This is supposed to be a show about Romans! Poor Romans, drunk Romans, the lowliest Romans of them all - but Romans! I ain't be running with that - he sighed. - Marcus, get a razor and take him to the makeup room. \n - I'm not going to shave - the actor stated. The director exhaled once again, barely containing his anger. \n- Andreas, you're making five grand here. You're not in a position to complain. Please, be a Roman and shave that fucking mustache. \n- Look, you're missing the point here. We're not making a show about Romans. It's about Calisians. \n- Darling, I know, I know, some people out there still wear facial hair like it was 2023. If I wanted to make a documentary, I'd go to National Geographic. But here - we're making a TV show that's supposed to convince people that no matter how deep they've fallen into the dumps, they are still Romans. And they should act like Romans. Including wearing facial hair like Romans do. And that Sarmatian-disco-catfish mustache does not fall into that category. \n- Say what you wish, I'm not shaving it. Fire me if you want. I do this job with a mustache, or I don't do it at all. \n\nThe air was so tense you could mistake it for plusquamperfectum. The director wiped his hand across his face and started anew. \n- Imagine that: your working wife is coming home from backbreaking work at an ambulatorium and sees your proletarian ass reclining on the lectus, drinking wine with your dumbass son. Instead of asking you if you've been searching for a job, she has to ask you: \"Why didn't you shave yet? Were you at the tonsor?\".

It had all the markings of a plot, an attempt to isolate them, cut them down, and then march into Germania with little to no opposition. They envied those stubborn enough to stay, resilient that a better opportunity would eventually present itself. Up until the Populares walked into the negotiating room with similarly little protection, they could feel the cold, hard steel of gladii pressed against their necks. Now, they were both equally trapped. \n\n- Alright, I'll be brief because we've only got fifteen minutes for this whole meeting. - the highest-ranking of the attendees began, at least judging by the brightness of his toga. - Anything longer would raise the suspicions of the Optimates. We've already lost the first two. Now, what is it that you want? \n- I assume you already know Germania has fallen, Consul. We have nowhere else to run to. We bring good people ready to do honest work. Surely Calisia has room for a few million additional loyal subjects. - one of the Barbari pleaded with the oratory skill of a veteran politician. Andreas Compa could swear he looked familiar. He knew he must have seen that face somewhere a long time ago. And that suspicious lack of a Germanic accent... If not for the rags he was wearing, the foreigner could almost certainly pass for just another Senator. A chilling thought. \n- Subjects that don't speak the language, don't know the culture, and most certainly don't value the aesthetic. We're not ones to bang the drum of chauvinism, but we're already stretched thin as is. \n- Consul, I will personally ensure that every single one of my compatriots assimilates. And those that don't will be reminded they can always end up back on the wrong side of the Viadrus. Not a single denarius will have to be spent from state coffers. \n- And the drawback? You seem far too... obedient for the bloodthirsty reavers we've been repeatedly warned about by our 'friends' on the other side of the aisle. \n- Too much Optimate propaganda, Consul? - the barbarian chuckled softly. \n- Well, when you're bombarded by it day and night, no wonder some of the prejudice seeps through. You'll get used to it. Once you've lived in the capital long enough, you'll swear the tribesmen you break bread with are beasts in human skin. It's part of the initiation, really. \n- Does that mean you'll allow our people to settle? - the barbarian spoke with a muted sense of hope. \n- Oh, please, that's a given. The decision was made long before you arrived. That's not why we invited you here. There's a storm on the horizon. The Optimates won't relent until we've either killed or banished every last one of your kind. The only way out of this is to defang them instead. And for that, we'll need your support. \n- We'd prefer not to involve ourselves in yet another political squabble, but if it's the only way... we have no choice but to accept. \n- Great. Now, may I know the name of my co-conspirator? \n- Tusc. Donaldus Tusc. - he replied as the two shook hands in agreement."

Had he not been naturally drawn towards centers of power, Donaldus Tusc would have seriously considered reneging on his deal with the Calisians, but, unfortunately, the good of the Germanic peoples required him to swallow up what remained of his pride and politely show up in the Senate as ordered. Barred from wearing a toga to avoid anyone accidentally thinking he belonged within the building's pristine marble walls, Donaldus was forced to endure the shame of wearing a bright, state-provided hi-vis with the word 'BARBARI' plastered across the whole length in massive letters, almost as embarrassing for his dignity as having to stand in pairs with his compatriots while seemingly every available Optimate has come down to sneer at them. Wandering aimlessly around the meandering corridors felt like some sort of cruel torture, and they were close to heading out and abandoning the whole ordeal until, at last, Senator Compa was able to step in and break their suffering. \n\n- Ah, Mr. Tusc, how wonderful of you to join us. I apologize for the... close-mindedness of my colleagues. Teaching them basic manners proved to be quite a challenge. \n- No worries, Consul. - the barbarian answered stoically. - I expected to be demonized from the moment I stepped foot on Polish... uh... Venedic soil. Bad memories, you see. \n- I'm... truly sorry to hear that. I hope this opportunity will be able to make up for it somewhat. I don't suppose you've had the chance to witness the democratic process firsthand before \n- Hmm, let's just say I've dabbled with something similar back home. - Tusc answered with a faint smile, concealing the tear forming in the corner of his eye. \n\nAfter being led by their patron to the upper gallery and told to 'Enjoy the show,' the barbarian delegation rested in their theater seats to discuss the finer particulars of Calisian politics to the tune of the crunching sounds of the mountains of popcorn and the slurping of soft drinks provided by the Populares. Once their chatter subsided, the lights dimmed, and one by one, in came the senators, with Consul Compa immediately taking center stage. \n\n- Countrymen, this truly is a momentous occasion. Despite the fearmongering of the Optimates, we have made great strides towards social acceptance. And thus, as a symbol of this progress, this session of the Senate will be watched by a loyal group of Barbari leaders! I would like to officially thank... \n\nLoudly, Andreas Compa fell to the floor, pushed by Consul Caletus in his bid to seize the pulpit. \n\n- Yeah, yeah, let's all welcome the coming doom of our Empire. Ingenious, Andreas, really, you sly bastard. Bring them in, replace all the Calisians with barbarian scum, and laugh in our faces as everything we've built crumbles to dust. Let me tell you something, Andreas! If you think you can turn your back on Calisia, you are gravely mistaken. I will make sure every last one of these mongrels gets deported back beyond the limes! And, Jupiter be my witness, if even the Emperor himself dares stand against me, I will make sure he meets the same end as every other traitor! \n\nAs he emptied the bag, eating multiple flakes at a time, enthralled in the displays of political grandstanding, Tusc wondered to himself, chuckling."

With a groggy expression and a still clouded mind, Victor got up with a yawn. 5AM, just about the worst hour to wake up for his shift. He grabbed his uniform and walked to the makeshift latrine out back. \n\nBefore him in the mirror stood a tall man with a very frazzled, poorly kept beard and tired face. Definitely didn't look like a victor to him. He'd definitely be hard to tell apart from a barbarian without his armor. Swap a set of clothes, and no one would be any wiser. \n\nThe spout ran cold water, and the only source of light was a flashlight running on low battery and a bit of morning sunlight pouring in from outside. They didn't even have electricity yet, and their precious generator fuel was not deemed important enough to be wasted on powering the barracks, especially this early. \n\nA few minutes later, he stepped out of the latrine, then the barracks, and into the cool morning air. The fog was so thick you couldn't see across the field surrounding his outpost. It was once a tollbooth, but it now made for a decent fortified checkpoint on the road from Goreliz to Budissina. The sign \"Autobahn 4\" was still hung up above, with a Calisian banner right beside it. \n\nWith a packet of breakfast MRE in hand, he stepped up to the one booth they actually bothered to keep operational and tapped on the glass window. It slid open to reveal an equally bored, though almost clean-shaven legionary with some noticeable cut marks left by his own attempts to shave with a knife. \n\n - Hey there, Octavius, your savior's here. My turn on the heater.  \n\n - Oh, Victor. Yeah, yeah, give me a sec. I've got some trash lying about here I gotta pick up. \n\n - Anything interesting happen on the night shift?\n\n - Oh yeah, totally. Aliens from space bringing me a cold glass of wine. No, of course not. What did you expect?\n\n - Not much. I thought we'd get a bit more action around here. Now hurry up and get some sleep. I'll take over from here.\n\nOctavius made his exit soon after, carrying some MRE wrappers and other miscellaneous junk in a plastic bag and some thick fantasy tome in his other one. Victor took the helm of the booth. It was pretty much the only place with heating aside from the barracks thanks to a little space heater under the desk. Beside it was a small electric kettle that was nearly kicked over on multiple occasions per shift but never moved, which Victor made ready use of to prepare his breakfast.\n\nIt was hours until something actually noteworthy happened. Victor was deeply engrossed in staring at a random wall. He was at his eighth cycle of changing points to stare off at. Just then, the power went out. He cursed under his breath and went off to grab their most qualified engineer, Constantinus, a guy who graduated from an electrician technicum."

calisia.80.desc: "Journal of Remigius Savicus, Day 5\n\nThe Balticum's coast is calm as ever. It doesn't feel much different here than near Svina Ostium. Our expedition is camped out in a small Calisian outpost between the cities of Zinnowitz and Zemplin. Despite the... rowdy nature of the Germanics, our team's mission has been going decently well. \n\nStatistics from before Germania's dissolution show that the larger settlements we've visited up to this point seem to be missing 47% of their population on average. The countryside villages seem to be experiencing the opposite effect, with an influx of refugees from more urbanized centers. Barter seems to have entirely replaced the use of formal currency, however, Calisian Denarii have already found their way into circulation, even before the Legions' arrival.\n\nCome morning, we'll leave the encampment after receiving additional fuel and supplies for the road. There are still multiple villages in our plans before reaching Wolgast and many more before Greifswald.\n\nJournal of Remigius Savicus, Day 7\n\nPeenemunde and its airport. Thus far, this has been the biggest sign of Calisian presence in the newly conquered lands. Owing to its small port and the aforementioned airfield, legionaries and even some eager citizens are already making the village and its surroundings their new home. \n\nSignage for the settlement's Calisian name is already replacing ones denoting its former Germanic identity, with any mentions of the old name being scraped from existence. To our knowledge, no other newly conquered land has taken to adopting a Latinized form. Most of the village's native population has either left for the countryside or been forcefully expelled by the region's administration.\n\nThe airport has become a legionary hub of sorts, with the command of the Wolgast area residing here instead of the city itself. Apparently, the city isn't in a state to host any kind of administration. We'll soon see for ourselves, as that will be the next stop on our voyage.\n\nDay 8\n\nMass graves. Dozens of them, ones that we've found at least. We were forewarned of Wolgast's devastation, but not in our darkest dreams did we expect to see the sights laid out before us. Almost half the city has been burnt down to the ground. According to information we could get from the city garrison's officer, most of the burnt-down buildings were already in that state before the Legions marched into the city. The same went for most of the mass graves. \n\nThey killed each other. Tore at one another's necks when their Confederation started to crumble. From a previous population of approximately 13000, we could only locate a little over a thousand. Starvation led to desperation, desperation led to barbarism, and barbarism brought the decimation of a city. We encountered grotesque sights along the way, but this is too much for me to stomach."

calisia.81.t: "Filius Fortunatus"
calisia.81.desc: "All my life, I've been out of luck. Born on the wrong side of the wall separating the Plebeian District from the Senatorial Quarter, I've had to live in the shadow of those ungrateful brats ever since. When my father wasn't busy getting drunk off his mind at the Temple of Bacchus, he'd try to reassert his authority in the house with a belt and a whip. I learned to run away whenever I heard his footsteps coming. Through a crack in the barrier, I slipped past to watch the ruling class' progenies, pampered with luxury and ordering their servants around without a care in the world. Guess that's where their disregard for our lives began. But I ain't no Senator's son, so no shortcuts will I receive. \n\nNow, as I sharpen my gladius and prepare for war, the prospect of their command remains no less terrifying. I look at my superior, barely old enough to serve, fail miserably to raise our legion's spirit. Ave Calisia, he shouts. Ave Calisia, I murmur in response. He orders us to march alone through the Marconian Forest. Walk behind enemy lines, he says. I fight the urge to protest, to let him know it's bound to be an ambush. But I ain't no millionaire's son, so to my death, I march. \n\nOur legion pushes through the forest, the crowns keep darkening the sky. The man before me, my sole guiding lantern, I know not his name, for he too is expendable. When an arrow pierces his skull, I do not shed a tear. He fulfilled his duty; died bravely for his country. Perhaps they'll tout him as a hero, give him a proper burial and a fancy grave. But I ain't no military son, so forgotten shall my service be. \n\nWhen the sound of drums filled the air, and Germanic chants drowned out my hearing, I watched my legion disintegrate as the soldiers ran for their lives in every available direction. I considered fleeing too, trying to save myself from the barbarian onslaught, but what point was there really to it? I was trained to fight, born to die, and I deserved no better than to rest by an unnamed tree's bark. So I stood, swung my sword as ordered until an axe's cleave ripped through my chest. Wounded, I collapsed onto the soft moss, as I drew my final breath. I clutched my dog tag, \"Iacobus Melnicus\" it said. Maybe somebody will find it, maybe they'll honor my memory. But I ain't no fortunate son, so among the roots, it will remain."

calisia.82.t: "No One Leaves"
calisia.82.desc: "To say Caletus was nervous was an understatement, yet on the outside, it looked just like another session of the Senate. \n-Your boys are all dolled up? Right? We're on with the show. We'll grill them long enough, they will feel like Catilina on the couch with five Ciceros behind them. Remember: stay outta the Senate chamber. We don't want any images of Praetorians behind the Senators. It won't sit right. \n- Yes, sir. No one enters, no one leaves. \n- Great. I'll be speaking first, then Scarginscis, then... \nThe doors of the chamber opened with impetus. \n- There's a problem. They found out. \n- What? \n- The Populares know. They are debating whether to leave. \n- Shit. Shit. Get more men upstairs. Cut off every door. If they try to leave, push them back. Gently - Caletus replied. - We're getting in with the lictors. \n\nThe doors opened, and the Optimates walked into a boiling sea of white togae and livid heads, screaming the wildest insults at them. The lictors, who should be following the putchists, had to make way for them down to the rostrum. \n- This is a breach of the sanctity of the Senate! I shall not allow this! \nCaletus was just about to give in to his impulse and answer, as anybody would answer in his position. \n- I am the Se... \nWait. This was not a Populares-aligned senator. This was an Optimate. A left-leaning one, but still. Some minor chair-filler squeezed in there just to keep the votes going. What was his name? Agrippa? Agrippa who? Agrippa Apapus, a thought sparked in Caleta's mind, and he chuckled inside. So much, he lost track of what he was going to say. \n- What the fuck are you doing? You're ours! \n- What the fuck are *you* doing? Is that supposed to be a coup? Who do you think you are? Some kind of run-of-the-mill usurper that will be thrown into the Prosna after one week! \n- You're with the Populares? Did the barbarians pound your ass too hard? Get lost! \n- I will! Do whatever you must, I won't participate in it! I'm leaving! \n\nAs the Senator made his way to the door, an officer walked into the chamber and spread his arms, trying to stop him. Damn idiot, Caletus thought. The noise was deafening. The lictors made their way up to apprehend the fugitive. \n- Out of my way, you lackey - Agrippa tried to shove him away. The Praetorian pushed him back. Gently. The elderly Senator flew back onto the lictors, onto their fasces, and then down on the floor. Blood stained the toga. \n\nThe Senators lividly rushed at the lictors and towards the doors. The Praetorians marched in, forming a cordon and pushing the Senators down the stalls. Caletus and his retinue grabbed onto the rostrum, watching as the man on the floor got trampled. As the soldiers moved in, all of the Senators were reduced to a huddled mass, squeezed into their seats, silenced by a series of gunshots. Two Praetorians grabbed the barely breathing Agrippa and shoved him onto his seat, where his body spread out, unconscious, with his bared chest discolored from numerous bruises. \n- Uh, we shall start today's extraordinary session of the Senate with a vote on the exclusion of the following traitors, cowards, and barbaric adherents from their offices..."

calisia.83.t: "Divide et Impera, Once Again"
calisia.83.desc: "Caletus took a big sip of wine and smiled, looking at the pile of papers before him. It was a pile of scraps - of leftovers from what he and his allies grabbed for themselves and themselves only. Now that they've secured a fine prize, only one thing left to do before he can enjoy it. Various associates, fellow travelers, officials et alia - all of whom expected something for the aid given to the new order. Now was the time of giving, of benevolence - and mutual codependence. \n\nThe Senator looked upon a hastily composed list of notable people who had not yet received compensation. Still, a few Populares-leaning names found their way there. Caletus scratched them out rapidly. They made up their minds far too late. The Optimate leader ripped a piece of paper and wrote their names on it, with the subscript \"add to proscription.\" Having put that aside, he went back to the main list. \n\nA villa here, a lump sum there. Next to some names of greater skill, Caletus wrote: \"eligible for promotion after background check.\" Nah, maybe it's too soon for that. Who knows how the wind will blow in the next few months? Or years? \n\nHow to assure the loyalty of these people? Should they be put on a payroll? How could they be controlled? If so, maybe there was no need for rewards? The list seemed more and more troublesome with every minute. \n\nSomeone knocked. Who could this be? It was way too late for a visit \n- Guard, who is it? \n- A lady, sir. A senator's wife. \n- Let her in. - Caletus answered after a moment of hesitation. \nThe woman was dressed in black. She sat in front of the desk and uncovered her face from the veil. Her middle-aged face was worn and tired.  \n- Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? \n- My name is Aemillia Tertia. My husband, the late Agrippa Caecilius, was a senator and an Optimate. He was murdered during the riots in the Senate. \nCaletus moved back in his chair. The woman paused for a while before she continued. \n- I am told the Populares were responsible for his death. Our estates were ruined during the last war, but my husband never relinquished his service to the republic. I'd prefer not to do this, but I am left with no funds for myself and my children. I ask, humbly, for your aid. \n\nSilence. Caletus looked through his list, struggling to come up with a reasonable answer. There was no name of this Senator or of anyone from his family on the list. There was already enough of those in need of a reward. \n- I will... It's not in my power to give anyone allowance so freely. Please write your name and the names of your children for me, and I will send them to my friend who deals with such matters. \n\nThe woman wrote four names on a scrap of paper, bowed, and proceeded to thank the Consul for a good while before saying goodbye. Caletus contemplated the names. What was the cost? What was the risk? Was it even worth it? It was already late in the evening, and still a lot of work waited ahead. He downed a cup of wine and wrote hastily at the bottom of the paper: \"Add to proscription.\""

calisia.84.t: "Nightingale in a Golden Cage"
calisia.84.desc: "As a loyal guard of the Emperor, I had to be prepared for anything. And I thought I was. That was before the order came from the government that Ricardus Calisius was not to leave the Palace at any cost. Ricardus Augustus Calisius, or Ricardulus as we affectionately called him between us, was not only the great Imperator of our state but also a pretty capable trickster. He wasn't about to go down easily, and he was particularly determined to break free from the palace walls. My mission: stop him at all costs. Easy, right? \n\nWrong.\nThe first hint of trouble came when I saw a makeshift rope dangling from the balcony of his room onto the inner square. Ricardulus, dressed in a ridiculous blend of pajamas and a golden laurel he clearly slept in, was about to rappel down. I had to act fast.\n- SIRE, I ORDER YOU TO GET BACK TO YOUR ROOM! - I shouted, my voice echoing through the grand hall.\n- YOU CAN'T ORDER ME, IANUS! I'M THE GOD HERE! - He yelled back, giving me a cheeky grin. He swung over the edge, gripping the rope. The rope, however, had other plans. With a loud snap, it broke, sending the Emperor plummeting downwards. Luckily, he landed in a conveniently placed heap of laundry. Not so luckily, the laundry was there for washing the dirty linens from the entire palace.\n- Freedom smells worse than I imagined. - He muttered, getting to his feet.\n\nI rushed over, but he was already on the move. Ricardus darted into the kitchen, and I followed close behind. There, he grabbed a large bun from the counter and brandished it like a sword.\n- En garde! - He challenged, waving the bread in my direction.\n- Seriously? - I sighed, dodging a swipe. - You're fighting me with a baguette?\nRicardus responded by throwing the bun at me and bolting for the door. I dodged, letting it hit the wall, and sprinted after him. Before I could grab him, he was already in the gardens, leaping through the bushes, covered in leaves and twigs, and ran towards the stables. How this old man of such mass was capable of sprinting was beyond me. And he actually did manage to make it for the horse, but the stallion wasn't all too happy about that massive cargo.\n- Come on, Micungula! Let's ride! - He urged the horse, which was completely ignoring him.\n- Sire, step away from the horse! - I called, approaching cautiously.\n- As if only you could command me. - He declared, just as the horse decided to comply, taking off at a slow trot. I jogged alongside, effortlessly keeping pace.\n- Yes sire, although you know... I can command a horse. And he's going to like where he's going, unlike yourself.\nDiverting the stallion to go into the palace wasn't hard. It was certainly easier than trying to force the Emperor to stay in his room, but when he was finally safely back in his room, and the horse stuffed into one of the biggest halls inside the palace, I resumed my post. Just another day guarding the Emperor's palace, and just another day dealing with the antics of the palace's very own escapist."

calisia.85.t: "Romanus et Iulia"
calisia.85.desc: "Iulia Caepasia was walking down the alley in the Plebeian District. She was wearing a ragged robe and covered her head with a hood. She looked at her phone for the instructions. She felt like a fish out of water in the streets forbidden for her class.\nDespite that, she soon arrived at the correct position.\n- Iulia? - The gentle male voice of Romanus Munatius reached her ears.\nShe rushed towards her lover, hugged him, and gave him a delicate kiss on the cheek.\n - It's so good to see you! - she exclaimed.\nThey spent the night walking through the forest and beaches. They even saw the sun rising over the Mare Balticum.\n - I don't know if I can go on like that. - Iulia confessed as their meeting was coming to an end. - My father started to suspect something.\n - I know, dear, but wait a bit longer. I have a plan to get to the Patrician District. With my savings, I managed to pay for a forged passport. I will pose as a servant ready to work. Then I... I'll figure something out.\n- That's dangerous, my love!\n- It's the only way to be with you.\nThey shared a kiss and began their journey back to Gedanum.\n\nIn the morning, Romanus headed towards the border of the districts as soon as possible. He found a massive line of people had already been waiting for the border post to open so they could get to work in the Patrician District as soon as possible. He waited patiently for his turn, hoping the forged passport would work.\n\n- I failed. - Romanus wrote the message. Iulia was in her room when the news of Romanus's failure reached her via the phone.\nShe was devastated.\n- Isn't your father looking for some more servants? - The message from him read. - I really need the money anyway.\n- No, he's been quite adamant while talking with my mom that we have enough servants already.\n- It pains me to say so, but I may be forced to leave Gedanum. - Iulia's hand began shaking as she read this message. - There's no work for me here, and the prospect of you being so close, yet so far, will kill me. And if your paranoid father starts going through your phone, I'll lose even this method of contacting you. It may be best that I leave.\n- Wait! - She quickly typed to stop his train of thought.\nShe needed a vacancy in her father's entourage. And she needed it desperately now. For Romanus. She hesitated for a bit, but she knew what must be done.\nWhen her father was preoccupied, she went to her father's room and stole one of his watches. She then planted the watch in a cupboard in his quarters. She bore no ill feelings toward the poor gardener, but she could see that the equally robust Romanus would be the natural replacement for him. And her father would probably be glad he could replace a Scythian with a Venetus. Now, she just needed the events to unfold.\n- Soon, you'll hear from my father herald that the patriarch of gens Caepasia is looking for a servant. Apply as soon as you can. - She instructed Romanus. - If that won't work, flee the city for both our sakes."

calisia.86.t: "Causa Finita"
calisia.86.desc: "The Imperial Palace was quite a dim place at this hour. Princeps Antonius had arrived to meet with his father, who was now but a shadow of his former self. The long months of unofficial house arrest had taken a severe toll on the Emperor's health. Despite the depressing situation surrounding them, the table was set as if for the most illustrious feast. Antonius knew what to expect, yet he was still somewhat taken aback by his father's condition. For a moment, he simply felt sorry for him, but then he remembered his own goals and why he had come.\n\n- Father, no one wants to see you wasting away like this. Look at yourself. You barely eat, and you can hardly walk on your own. We all appreciate your sacrifice, but you know, you always said one must know when to leave the stage undefeated. I'm worried about you - he said it with a compassionate tone, but in the end, it was just an illusion. Antonius was at most angry. For so many years, his father's favorite had always been Ignatius, even though he was entirely unfit to rule.\n- Antonius, my son. The Empire needs me. I cannot abandon it in its time of need.\n- Dad... there is no war anymore. We won. You can rest.\n\nThe Princeps was becoming irritated by the Emperor's stubbornness, but cold calculation did not allow him to show the weakness that still lurked within him. He pitied his father, but only he could now save the Empire from falling into a dependence on the Senate. And the last obstacle, unfortunately, was Ricardus. Between the first and second courses, he finally decided to lay all his cards on the table.\n- Augustus. That's what they called you. Do you know what they call you now? The Emperor who lost the people. The people have turned away from you. - Antonius began. At the sound of these words, the Emperor almost choked on a piece of meat and began to turn red. He immediately started having trouble breathing, trying frantically to reach for the wine goblet. Antonius stood up and approached his father, moving the goblet away while looking straight into Ricardus' eyes, which were now staring at his stepson in terror, unable to utter a single word.\n- You lost your family. You lost your faction. You lost the Empire. Ignatius won't save us, and you know that well. How many hours did I spend sitting with private tutors? You gave me the best education, for which I am grateful. And that's why I'm telling you directly - the people and the Senators trust me. I know what needs to be done to preserve Calisia's glory. You can't hand over the power to the Senators! If you don't abdicate... you know what THEY will do to you. You know it very well. I don't want it to come to that. Step down. I beg you.\n\nWith these words, he took the goblet with the drink and gently pushed it toward the Emperor. Ricardus hesitated for a moment, but finally, with resignation, he took the goblet and emptied it in a few seconds. He looked as if he had just run a marathon, and with terrible exhaustion in his voice, he said:\n- Son...\n- Yes, father?\n- You remind me so much of your mother... I need to rest. Take me to my chamber, please..."

calisia.87.desc: "Well, well. It's over. We did it, Christianus; the good guys won.\n\nThe Prefect and the Consul sat on the front seat of Calisia's throne room, where the new, better, more pliant Emperor was being crowned. The priest spoke the words that meant so little to Caletus, and Emperor Antonius repeated words, the essence of which was unknown to Cinastovicus. And that's what worried him.\n\n - Petrus, you're wrong on both counts. First off, we're not the good guys, and the sooner we stop pretending otherwise, the more benefit for our mental health. Second, nothing's done. We have won long ago, and now we're playing a new bout. Another game. It doesn't stop. There is always a new pretender, issue, or person who stakes his claim to absolute power. It will stop when we're dead or retired, honorably or otherwise. Wanna retire?\n\n - No, but the Emperor is ours, the Senate is ours, and you have a stranglehold on all dissent. This isn't just a game; this is a race, and we're running circles around whoever might show up.\n\n- Is he, Petrus? Is the Emperor ours now? Look at him. \n\n- Antonius was focused, repeating the empty words, but his sight wasn't empty. It looked at the people far behind both power brokers, for it looked at Calisia itself. His sight was as intense as it got, as if ready to channel all his willpower, power of will... will to power, into a devastating laser. \n\n- The Emperor remembers what happened to Ricardus and knows the benefits of keeping us around. He'll know his place. - Caleta barely believed his own words. \n\n - We are an autocracy. - Cinastovicus moved in for a slam dunk in that quiet debate. - And in an autocracy, two things determine who's in charge: ruthlessness and intelligence. Now, we excel in ruthlessness, and we're no idiots. As for Antonius ... he was clever enough to make it hard for us to pull the IQ test he took a few years back. He was ruthless enough that we concluded he's gonna amount to something in the first place. And...\n\n - Cinastovicus passed a small note to his countryman, friend of convenience, a fellow player. Petrus Caletus read it, and a cold sweat began to form on his forehead. He quietly gave the note back. He soon calmed down and forced a smile as they stood and clapped at the coronation being complete. \n\n - Well, it's early enough that we have the headstart to keep him in his place. \n\n - We do, as long as you realize the importance of me being on your side.- Cinastovicus smiled, knowing the actual IQ score of their new Imperator was ten points lower than what he let Kaleta believe. Not that it didn't make Antonius cleverer than both of them. But now, no more talking. Antonius' mighty eyes were on them. And he began his ascension speech."

I may not be his true son... but I am the one true successor. Every dream that I had for the last fifteen years has prepared me for this moment. All the pieces of the domino have fallen in exactly the right way. It was clear that the Parcae really did favor me over every other usurper. \n\nNow, the whole might of the Empire will be at my disposal. Every man, woman, and child standing outside waiting for me will be a fate tied to my own. They will love me as they once loved my father, and they will thrive under my guidance. I know it.

I take this first moment before you not to glorify myself but to honor my father! In his honor, I declare that my rule shall usher in a new era. An era of moral virtue, of dignity. The debauchery and chaos that we endure will have to end! Calisia shall once again be as she once was. A proud Empire, of virtuous women, and honest men! You, of all, should be glad and thankful to be a part of something that is as great as Calisia itself. But, for every victory, there are several losses along the way. And we can never forget these painful lessons because that's what makes us strong and united! I promise you, my beloved brothers and sisters, if we were to face such a crisis once again, I will move the heavens for our Empire to be safe. And if I can't do that, I shall raise hell for our enemies. The whole world will know our might, fear the wrath we can bring, and enjoy the blessed fruits of civilization that we spread! We are the shield and the sword of the occident! We are the descendants of Rome! WE ARE CALISIANS! AVE CALISIA!\n\nAnd now... the first act of the play is finished..."

calisia.89.t: "Excellentia in Labore"
calisia.89.desc: "For Adrianus, there rarely was a day in any way more noteworthy than the rest. Other than the customary few beers sipped on the couch with the faintest sense of enjoyment after a day of backbreaking work, there was little for the aging welder to actually look forward to. Over the three decades of his meager 'career,' spent mostly on the same worksite, in the same position, under the same manager, and with the same inflation-unadjusted salary that barely sufficed to make ends meet, he'd long since learned to forego any ambition and simply do his best to diligently fly under the radar. Thus, he was more than surprised when he learned his performance caused him to accidentally stumble into the title of 'model worker,' entitling him to a hefty cash prize awarded directly by Princeps Ignatius. \n\nWith a newfound sense of purpose, or perhaps simply to avoid the consequences that embarrassing the company would bring, Adrianus set out to prepare for what was undoubtedly his life's biggest occasion. Doing a neat shave for once, searching the backs of drawers for his sole passable flannel, telling the missus to sew back the missing buttons, whipping out the old press to iron out the creases, alright, let's try it on... ugh, yeah, no chance that's gonna fit... \n\n- Helenia! Buy me a new flannel, will ya? This one must've shrunk in the wash or something! \n\nAll in all, it took nearly a week of the poor welder's efforts to reach a state most affluent urbanites would refer to as 'acceptable.' Still, the effortless gallantry of the Princeps, covered in fine fabrics and with the softness of someone whose hardest responsibility was lifting his wine cup, clashed sharply with Adrianus' rugged image. Though, normally, he'd learned not to care for any authority, the regal aura exuded by Ignatius was more than enough to intimidate him. \n\nWith a learned sense of aristocratic politeness, the heir to the Calisian throne shook the hand of the overwhelmed workman, congratulating him for his achievements with a barely disguised disinterest. And when the massive cheque was wheeled in by the Princeps' servants, the sum larger than any Adrianus had previously seen, the recipient could feel himself hyperventilating in anticipation. \n\n- I now bestow upon thee this here prize for your efforts to advance Calisian labor. May it serve you and your comrades well once you split it among yourselves. \n- Split? M... my lord, I thought that this reward would be all mine. \n- Oh, no, no. That would be unfair to your other colleagues. Labor is a collective effort, after all. I'm sure they worked just as hard, and you know how wrong it would be to play favorites. \n- B... but... what would that leave me? \n- About 20 Denarii, give or take. Now, how about you all use the money to celebrate? I heard from my father that the Ranula nearby offers great hotdogs. You should definitely try them out. \n- Y... yes my lord - Adrianus answered, the sense of disappointment crushing his very being."

calisia.90.t: "Finis Historiae"
calisia.90.desc: "After an exhausting day at work, Martinus sat back on his dusty living room couch and opened the latest edition of the Acta Diurna. Though he had long since abandoned the idea that his voice mattered at all in the public forum, he was determined to stay up to date with everything that was happening on the Calisian political scene. Perhaps, one day, if he waited long enough for his lucky break, he could realize his dream of joining the Senatorial ranks. With the vision in his mind giving him the necessary motivation, despite the tiredness of the rest of his body, he flipped the newspaper open and glanced at the first page. \n\n> EMPEROR RICARDUS CALISIUS SPOTTED SUNBATHING AT THE MARE BALTICUM!\n\nTourists visiting the calm resort town of Coslinum were greeted with an unusual anointed visit. From behind an improvised fort of windbreaks, the Emperor's belly poked out to greet all beachgoers and grant the surprised visitors a once-in-a-lifetime audience. Rumbling regally in response to the citizens' pleas, the royal gut dutifully performed stately duties during its holder's slumber, growling loudly to agree with every noteworthy petition and churning softly to reject each... \n\nMartinus turned the page, hoping to finally get to the real news. \n\n> IMPERATOR CALISIUS GIVES IT HIS ALL ON THE TENNIS COURT! \n\nLooks like our Emperor isn't always the stern disciplinarian we, the people know him as. During one particularly uneventful Friday, while the Senate was busy deliberating on some unrelated, and frankly boring finance bill, Ricardus was spotted enjoying a friendly game against his friend, Silvius Iacobinus! Though it's hard to determine which of the tactically, and tactfully, swaying titans of the racket won the contest, we have obtained exclusive photos of the match, available only... \n\nThe lack of anything informative was starting to frustrate Martinus. Desperate to find at least one article he could glean some insight from, he began sifting through the pages. \n\n> THE MODEST, THE OPULENT, AND THE OBSCENELY RICH. A TOUR OF POLITICIANS' PRIVATE ESTATES! \n\n> EMPEROR RICARDUS SPOTTED INSIDE LOCAL RANULA! HIS SELECTION OF SAUCES WILL CLOG UP THE ARTERIES OF EVEN THE MOST VETERAN FOODIES! \n\n> OLIVES, CHEESES, AND A GOOD DOSE OF LATIUM. THE EMPEROR REVEALS HIS RECIPE FOR A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE! \n\nHaving found nothing even remotely of note, Martinus angrily chucked the paper against the nearest wall. Just a year ago, he could effortlessly follow the epic struggles between the Populares and the Optimates, the barbarian crisis, the ever-shifting winds of court intrigue... now all that was being reported was, at best, pointless drivel. It seemed that there was nothing to even report on anymore, and the slow news cycle became the new norm. Perhaps, in a state so far out of time, this truly was the end of history."

calisia.91.t: "Verba Ultima"
calisia.91.desc: "Candles flickered dimly, their glow as faint as the Emperor's pulse. On every available surface, sticks of incense filled the air with an overwhelming smell, clogging the nostrils, yet still barely able to disguise the ubiquitous stench of decay. A figure kneeled by the bedside, desperately holding onto the Emperor's hand as if trying to direct his own life force into the dying man's body. Two decades of war have taken a heavy toll on Ricardus, tearing away at the remains of his strength until they had reduced him to a walking corpse. Now that the future of Calisia was secure, he was finally ready to rest. \n\n- Father, please don't go. The Empire needs you... I need you. I'm not ready. Please, you'll get through this, just... stay with me. \n\n- Ignatius, I've done my best to raise you with what little time I had. - The Emperor's weak voice, requiring a herculean effort to conjure up enough air to produce even the slightest of sounds, was nonetheless reassuring for the already-grieving Princeps. - I'm sorry I wasn't always there for you. But I know you've grown up into a worthy successor. All I've built will soon be yours, my son. Treat the role not as a burden but as a chance to change this country for the better, and it will bring you as much joy and satisfaction as it always gave me.  \n\n- No... it doesn't have to end this way. You still have so much to live for, so much to accomplish. You just need to hold on... Please, for me. \n\n- Son,  I'm just a relic of a bygone age. I remember life before the Fall, before Calisia. To me, this will never be a true homeland. I've played my part, but now the Empire needs someone new, someone who genuinely believes in its mission. \n\nFather, you have built this Empire from nothing. It... it will always be your homeland. And it will always honor you. But... we still need your guidance... \n- Ignatius, my generation is a lost one. Once you've spent most of your life in what we now call Polonia, it is impossible to simply forget it all and start anew. Sometimes, I wished we didn't have to wear these uncomfortable togas and speak in faux Latin. What to me was a daily struggle, for you, is the natural reality of life. \n\nIgnatius tried to respond, the tears choking up his words. He wanted to keep pleading, begging his father for another breath, for one more heartbeat. He felt powerless, crushed by the pressure in his chest. Deep down, he already knew it was inevitable. \n\n- You'll make a fine Emperor. - Ricardus smiled with the remainder of his strength. - I promise I'll always be by your side. I know you'll make me proud, son. \n\nWith each word becoming progressively muted, the Emperor finally closed his eyes for the very last time. For a brief moment, silence filled the room, only to be immediately broken by the Princeps' desperate, wailing sobbing."
calisia.91.a: "Only after two hours did he muster the strength to come out."

calisia.92.t: "A Veteran's Respite"
calisia.92.desc: "Though the usual clamor of his legions was nothing to overlook, the noise of the crowd gathered at the Forum Calisianum made an impression even on the decorated legate Vinicius. During all the trials he endured overseeing the Empire's many campaigns, he hardly ever had a chance to sit back and revel in the moment. What for others was an event of absolute importance, the first peaceful crowning in Calisia's history, was little more than an overdue vacation for the grizzled commander. As dignitaries hurried to and fro in a Sisyphean bid to ensure every single element of the ceremony was perfectly planned, organized, and executed, Marcus Vinicius lounged in his seat with a cup of Latium wine. Due to the harsh reality of legionary existence forcing him to repeatedly both drown his sorrows and celebrate his victories with cheap booze, he could hardly remember the last time he had the opportunity to sample the late Emperor's favorite liquid pleasure. He winced. It was far too sweet for his simple tastes. \n\n- How are you finding the wine, Marcus? We might need you to take care of the stockpiles now that Ricardus is gone. - A friendly voice asked politely, taking the padded seat next to the legate. \n- You know it's not my way to muse about the finer qualities of wine, Andreas. Though it's... pleasant, I suppose. A fine way to honor the memory of a fallen titan. \n- As if any such compliments could come close to representing his lofty heights. - He sighed. - Things won't be as easy now without his guidance. \n- No, they won't, but I guess that's why you got me here, isn't it? \n- Perhaps. Tell me, Marcus, isn't it tiring spending your whole life in a military camp? You've done a remarkable job serving the Empire on the frontlines, but now, we need you here. With all the comforts we could provide, it would almost be like an early retirement. \n- You know it's neither the money nor fame I do all of this for, Andreas. If Ignatius requires me in the capital, I am at his service and ready to move in an instant.\n- Speaking of Princeps Ignatius... ahem, Imperator Ignatius, what do you make of him? I don't doubt the blood of Ricardus coursing through his veins, but I worry whether he'll be able to live up to his father's level. It pains me to think what might happen should the burden of ruling overwhelm him. \n- I wouldn't be so quick to jump to such conclusions. He's a good lad and his heart is in the right place. That's all that matters. Even took him on a campaign once when he was younger. If he's half as sharp now as he was back then, Ricardus has left the Empire in capable hands... \n- ...and should he require assistance learning the ropes, well, I suppose that's where we come in. So, cheers, Marcus. To the health of our new Emperor! \n\nAs the two officials slowly sipped their wines in celebration of the bright future that seemed to lay before the Imperium Calisianum, a future they helped achieve, a loud gasp spread through the crowd as Ignatius collapsed to the ground in the middle of the ceremony. When the Emperor stood back up and dusted off his regal robes, they couldn't help but share a hearty laugh."
calisia.92.a: "Well, Marcus, seems like your retirement will have to be a productive one."

calisia.93.t: "Regnum Populare"
calisia.93.desc: "The noise was deafening, the light - nearly blinding. All my life, I've been told to prepare for this moment, yet can one truly ever be ready? All around me, the people cheered, chanted my name long before I even made my appearance. If anything, it only made the weight of the responsibility placed on my shoulders feel even heavier. Their expectant eyes, they all had that glint in them as if trying to tell me something I don't yet understand. Was it hope? Fear? I kept telling myself that there was at least some degree of sympathy in there. These people; they practically worshipped my father. Now, they want me to continue his legacy. As if it was so simple to follow in the footsteps of a figure so monumental... \n\nOver the years, my educators made sure to thoroughly drill the routine of the coronation into my head. The most important event of my life, they called it. In a way, I was thankful. With so many people looking up at me for guidance, I could hardly hear my own thoughts, much less try to recall the specific set of movements required not to make a fool of myself in front of the whole Empire. As the time to formalize the start of my reign drew nearer, my heart pounded so hard, I felt its every contraction in my chest. A deep breath. You've got this, Ignatius. \n\n> Five steps forward (Please don't stumble. Please don't stumble.) \n> Kneel before the Pontiff (Don't you dare judge my performance. You're improvising far more than I am.) \n> Mutter a quick prayer and receive his blessing (Is it just me, or was everything he said totally incoherent?) \n> Three more steps of 'exquisite elegance' (Vincentius, I will never forgive you for making that part so vague.) \n> Reach out my right hand and receive the Royal Scepter - (W... why does it feel so heavy?) \n> Approach the laurel wreath (This feels wrong. I... I don't deserve it.) \n> Take it from its cushion and place it softly on my head (Do not panic. Do not panic.) \n> Spread out my arms and wait for the servants to fasten the paludamentum at my shoulder (Could they please be quicker? I really don't feel well.) \n> And finally, deliver a rousing speech to the public (Alright, here goes nothing.) \n\nCalisians! Countrymen! Citizens of all creeds! I know you yet mourn the death of my father, and I thank you greatly for all the compassion you've shown him. Ricardus had a vision. A vision that lives in all of our hearts. One that transcends our personal interests and petty squabbles. Though he may be gone, the legacy he left behind will always be with us. For this vision, this dream is the Calisia we now get to live in, the one he built through his tireless effort. I know I won't be able to accomplish achievements nearly as monumental as his. But I promise you this! For as long as I draw breath, the dream of Ricardus will continue to guide us toward a fairer, more equitable Empire that anyone can call home, Calisian or Veneti alike! Citizens, say it with me! Ave Ricardus Calisius! I vow I will do everything in my power to make him proud. \n\nAs an unending cheer rumbled through the crowd, the gathered were lost in their reverence and fervor. Seeing his moment, the young Emperor hurriedly left the people's view and shuffled behind the stage."

All the explosives that failed to go off were cleaned up, and more than enough evidence to sink a ship was planted anywhere the Cohortes Urbanae or some gullible low-ranking members of the Guard would turn.\n\nA stage was set up in front of the Palace. There, Cinastovicus would deliver his address to the people. They needed answers, and he'd deliver them the best-crafted half-truths and fabrications they could think up. He stepped up, an assortment of other high-ranking members and Optimate senators beside him in attendance. Soon enough, he spoke.\n\n- Calisians! You have all heard the news of our glorious Emperor's death. However, I believe not all of you know the truth of the matter. Ricardus Augustus Calisius was slain by a group of frenzied barbarians. His body was brutally mangled. \n\n§0We had to finish him off. All that fat made it hard to hit the guts.§!\n\n - An intervention by the Palace Guards was rendered impossible by the fires that were lit around every entrance. The bodies of the assailants were found scattered among the bodies of the Emperor's own royal guard. They were all beyond saving by the time the Vigiles arrived on the scene.\n\n§0They were loyal to their last breath, both sides.§!\n\n- It is a shame that it is under these circumstances it has fallen upon me to reveal this to all of you. Emperor Ricardus Augustus Calisius was a tyrant. \n\n§0The circumstances couldn't have been better.§!\n\n - The Guard discovered documents dating back all the way to the Ager Publicus scandal proving the Emperor's interference in the Senate. Bribes and political favors were routine in passing legislation throughout most Senate hearings. The Populares were granted privileges that the Optimates could only dream of.\n\n§0A stretch for sure, but the documents don't lie. The Populares heavily relied on his intervention.§!\n\n- Then, there is also the matter of Marcus Vinicius. It is a great shame that Calisia's greatest defender had to fall from such a repulsive attack. He was a true hero, one that was an immense inspiration for many, including myself. He was unceremoniously crushed under the rubble while assisting the Vigiles during the Fire. \n\n§0A happy little coincidence... If he was just a bit less altruistic, he would've been a big thorn in our side.§!\n\n - For the time being, the Praetorian Guard will assume temporary rule over the Res Publica until tensions subside. It is a necessity for the greater good of all the citizens. For the time being, meetings of the Senate will be temporarily suspended, and all matters of governance relegated to the Guard."

calisia.96.t: "Worst Hangover Ever"
calisia.96.desc: "- Damn it, the wine's finished. Time to head in... head... out? Head... hurts.\nQuintus was not the most responsible citizen. His plebeian and vulgar approach to life meant he spent most of his time in his basement, which he called an apartment, playing video games. He had wasted the last few days consuming pizza and wine with no contact with the outside world. Upon leaving his block, he was in for an apocalyptic shock.\nThe city was engulfed in smoke. Some buildings still smoldered, and streets were strewn with ash and rubble. No one was in sight; everything around either closed or burned. Absolute silence reigned over the city. The world had ended, and no one had informed Quintus of this fact.\n- What happened here? AM I IN HADES? But why would it look like Calisia?\nHe decided to walk towards Caesar's Square near the market, hoping to see a living human soul. In the gate of one tenement, he saw one of the local homeless bums pushing his belongings in a small cart. The man looked like he had just come out of the arms of Pluto. Upon seeing Quintus, he beckoned him with a hand gesture.\n- Dominus, can you spare three denarii because I need to get out of the city, and it's hard to go sober.\n- Alright, if you tell me why everything looks like the end of the world around here.\n- Oh! I know what happened! I see everything, I hear everything! It's those barbarians! They set the whole city on fire! And they say our Emperor is dead! Burned him alive and crucif...!\nAt that moment, they heard screams from a nearby building and saw Praetorians emerging from the staircase, dragging a family out onto the street. They were terrified, and the Praetorians seemed smug and even happy to torment the civilians. Why? Well, Quintus and the homeless man were about to find out, as the soldiers immediately spotted them.\n\n- Hey, you there! Stop! - one of the Praetorians shouted. The two men were too scared to move.\n- By imperial decree, everyone must go to the Forum Calisianum. No staying at home. Go and celebrate! - The Praetorian's words made no sense. The city was in ruin, and they were supposed to celebrate?\n- Ah... what's the occasion? Did I sleep through some holiday? - Quintus asked uncertainly. The Praetorian gave him a piercing look that made him wince.\n- The tyrant is dead. You are free.\n- Oh. Right, tyrannicide. A movable feast, that's why I forgot. I understand. Of course. Yes, we will naturally go to the forum. Freedom, I love and understand. I can't give up freedom, yes, yes.\nQuintus's panicked tirade was interrupted by the second Praetorian, who was pushing the family they had previously dragged out.\n- And make sure they get there too. Because if not... we know where you live.\n- Of course, sir! We'll watch them. Take care of them! Say, you don't happen to know if there is any Ranula open at this hour? I really need some wine - the hobo didn't know when to shut up. But surprisingly, the soldier replied.\n- Go to the warehouse on Via Aurea. They'll fetch you some Latium wine. Remember to raise your toast to the Praetorian prefect."

calisia.97.t: "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"
calisia.97.desc: "- Glory to the Liberatores! - With these words, the Praetorians raised a toast, celebrating their tyrannicide in the Emperor's Palace. In the chamber where the Emperor once ruled, the fate of the empire was now being decided. The most important prefects had been gathered by their commander, Christianus Cinastovicus, who, for the first time in many years, did not hide his satisfaction.\n- Dear colleagues, comrades, I salute you all, individually and collectively. Our plan was executed flawlessly; we achieved everything we set out to do, and the execution was impeccable. I could not have accomplished this without your dedication. The entire project was fraught with numerous variables, and it is truly a miracle that we brought it to fruition without radical changes. I have dreamed of this day since I was unceremoniously removed from my position as city president. They took away in an instant what I had fought years for as if it were a mere toy taken from a naughty child. But a child, just like an adult, can burn down the whole house. Revenge is sweet, as they say. But this wine is even sweeter, and finally, after so many years, I can say without hesitation: cheers!\n\nAfter the stirring speech, the prefects moved to the adjacent room, where Cinastovicus took the Emperor's seat, opened a file of documents, and pulled out a letter.\n- Gentlemen, before we continue with our well-deserved hedonistic practices... one last business matter. Tomorrow, we will wake up in a new Calisia. We have our fingers on the pulse, and it is up to us to determine the colors of tomorrow's dawn. Here, I have a letter from Consul Caletus. It contains support for our cause and readiness to act if necessary. In short, the Optimates want to align with us. They dream of a renewed republic. Without monarchs.\n\n- If there is no emperor, what, then is the purpose of the Praetorian Guard? - Asked one of the prefects.\n- To hell with the Optimates! To hell with the republic! We have them all in our grasp! Let's do what we must! Let us appoint our own emperor - another official raised his voice.\n- Gentlemen, we should at least weigh the pros and cons. Such a decision cannot be made hastily! They offer us support, which would help us avoid unnecessary casualties, and we would have a solid foundation. And the Optimates... they can always be controlled.\n- Try controlling that madman Caletus - Gaius Ceplus, who had been silent until then, spoke up. - the Optimates are animals. All they care about is a bribe in their pocket and a seat in the Senate. They are ready to unleash hell if it means being re-elected for another term. Do you think the Populares were traitors for letting the barbarians in? They did it in accordance with their own views. Caletus would debase himself with the very king of the Goths if it meant his faction would continue to rule.\n- We lack political backing, and, administratively, we are spread too thin. We cannot govern solely with a strong military, which we do not fully control either...\n\nAfter hearing a multitude of opinions and a lot of bickering, Cinastovicus finally raised his hand, silencing everyone immediately."

calisia.98.desc: "It was the middle of the night at the intersection of Via Legionis and Via Industrialis. Caletus had been waiting two weeks for this moment. Finally, today, he managed to catch the vandal tearing down his election posters. Excited, he jumped out of the bushes where he had been vigilantly watching the horizon and rushed towards the spiteful criminal.\n- Salve, motherfucker! Stop in the name of the Senate! I'm performing a senatorial intervention! You'll spend the rest of your life in the arena...\n\nSenator Caletus never held his tongue. But, it stuck in his throat when he saw that the person destroying his posters was a member of the Praetorian Guard. Shock quickly gave way to another wave of anger when the guard didn't even react to the politician's arrival.\n- Hey, dickus minoris! I'm talking to you!\n\nIt was probably not a wise move to resort to physical violence against a battle-hardened Praetorian, but Caletus was not one to think before acting. He grabbed the guard's cloak and tried to pin him against the wall. The guard, with grace, broke free from the Senator's grip and, with two swift moves, brought him to the ground.\n- Listen to me once and for all because I won't repeat myself. You are nothing. Your entire faction is useless. You are parasites. You think you'll win the election? What fucking election? What game are you playing? Do you really think everything will go back to the way it was? You are our whores, so get it through your thick skull and don't mess around, or we'll cut off your empty head. Understand?\n\n- Y-yes, of course - Caletus was nearly brought to tears, or at least played the victim well. The Praetorian released him and walked to a nearby parked chariot. This didn't stop the Senator, who quickly got up and rushed towards the vehicle, which had already started moving.\n- PRAETORIANS ARE OBSOLETE, NO EMPEROR, NO PRAETORIANS - he began shouting at the top of his lungs. Someone from a nearby block yelled, \"Shut your mouth,\" but the Senator was already in his standard fury.\n- YOU WHOREMASTERS, BASTARDS OF HADES, SOMEONE HAS TO FINALLY PUT YOU IN YOUR PLA...\n\nCaletus couldn't finish his sentence as the chariot driven by the praetorian sped past him and deftly knocked him unconscious with a swift sideswipe. Apart from a broken arm, Caletus didn't suffer any serious injuries. But the worst was his wounded pride. Instead of this situation silencing the leader of the Optimates, the next day, he recorded a video for all the media, claiming an assassination attempt on his life by the Praetorians. The prefect, however, was pleased with the turn of events. After all, Caletus had exposed himself to attack, using vulgar words to describe the entire Praetorian Guard and their leaders, insulting them up to three generations back. That was all they needed to start a massive purge within the ranks of the Senate's last faction."

First fucking hit, and they're just dead.\nThe great strategists of the ancient world would surely envy the strategic skill of the Praetorian prefect, who, with simple yet fervent passion and concern for his charges, laid out the tactics for the upcoming clash with the rebellious urban cohort near Gedanum. The Praetorians may have had skill in both hand and foot, but the ability of logical and critical thinking was not among them; it was this lack of independent thought that guaranteed them a place in the Guard. So they stood and tried to acknowledge the words that were being uttered.\n- Alright, listen up! In close combat, we're using our gladii. When you charge, throw your pilum at the first sucker you see, or charge with it right into the enemy and fuck 'em up. Then you bash 'em with your shield and beat 'em down. Keep your eyes peeled.

If he isn't, just kick him until he sees Pluto's gate!\n\nIt wasn't certain if any word reached the purple-clad grunts, and the prefect was pretty aware of this, so he moved on to the demonstration, positioning one of the Praetorians opposite him and began showing the movements through an example:\n- See, it's all about the entrance. Head down, shield up, spear out, and then you charge, BAM. - the passion with which the prefect presented the charge caused him to skewer the poor Praetorian who served as a training dummy.\n\n- What did I tell you? It works! Take care of him. What do you mean he's dead? Oh, shit. Okay, Paulus - you're going to be in the hastati now! Alright, let's split into two groups and warm up. And remember, in battle, it's all about that first fucking hit! Then it's smooth sailing.\n\nFortunately, the training before the actual battle was completed without further loss of life. Reaching the city gates also proved uneventful, but trouble began when both sides couldn't find each other in the maze of blocks in Gedanum even though they both gentlemanly agreed to do battle in one place. Ultimately, it turned out that the entire urban cohort had simply gone for lunch at Burgerrex, while the Praetorians circled around the city center. However, the meat-stuffed city guards made easy targets for the fanatic guardsmen. When both sides amassed their forces facing each other in the city center, there was half an hour of shouting, screaming, and insults. When they finally charged, the Praetorians broke the ranks of the urban cohorts in a matter of minutes and won the fight handily. And all thanks to the first \"fucking\" hit."

calisia.100.desc: "Blood. Entrails. The earth littered with bodies. I still remember that one terrified young lad. He couldn't have been more than eighteen years old, skinny as a stick but feisty. He was afraid. So afraid... I tore his throat with my teeth to make him stop screaming. I had to. I really had to! They said if I defeated them all, I'd see my family. They held them hostage and ordered us to keep fighting. Another arena, another massacre. And they just watched as we slaughtered our own kin.\nDietrich sat in the middle of an old barracks that more closely resembled cages from labor camps than barracks. He pondered the previous fight in the arena. He wasn't alone; there were five other barbarians with him. Four Germans, one Scythian. It didn't matter anymore what they were called. They had been dehumanized enough. They sat in dead silence, their eyes wandering the walls while simultaneously penetrating into another world. Those who still had any illusions thought about their loved ones. Others, whose gladiatorial experiences hadn't somehow broken them yet, tried to push the screams and the omnipresent death they had experienced out of their minds. They didn't communicate with each other. They didn't have the right words to utter any sentence. Hope had been taken from them by the crowds cheering at the sight of torn bodies and decapitations.\n\nAt one point, three armed soldiers entered the barracks.\n- Salve, barbarians. You put on quite a show! The plebs loved you; you're their favorites. You're lucky; that was your last fight in the arena - said the Praetorian officer. None of the gladiators lifted their heads, except for the Scythian, who suddenly began to tremble. - From now on, you'll be soldiers of the Empire! That's right! With me, I have the recruitment papers that will enlist you into the first cohort of the Third Legion of the Foederati. You'll get privileges, and your families will be able to stay in the Empire as servants to the patricians of Calisia. Chin up! You've won the greatest prize you could imagine in your situation!\n- W-what privilege do we get? - Asked Dietrich in broken Latin, finally looking the Praetorian straight in the eyes.\n- What privilege? The privilege of life, Germānus. Oh, and you'll have spaghetti for lunch today. Consider that... a welcome gift.\nThe Praetorians began to laugh as if someone had said the funniest thing in the world or another joke about a man dressed as a woman. When they left, still no one was able to speak up or even move. Are they supposed to fight for the people who have stripped them of their humanity? Do they think a bowl of warm pasta will solve years of humiliation?\n\n- THE PASTA IS A LIE!!! - shouted the Scythian, now unable to control his trembling. He stood up, took off his belt from his pants, and went with it to the room that was supposed to mimic a toilet. Everybody knew what he was up to. No one tried to save him, to reason with him. When they thought Calisia had taken everything from them, the Empire struck back and took even more. Someone will have to clean up the Scythian's body before it starts to stink more than it already does."

Eight years as an auxiliary, four years on the limes, then five full years in the Praetorian cohort, service as an evocati in the guard, a total of twenty years of experience, and here they pay me like I've been punched in the face. How on earth did Flavius get a bigger sack than me?\n- Fucking hell, Juno's cunt!\n\nThe courtyard of the Imperial Treasury in Calisia was a scene of eager anticipation and bustling activity. It was payday for the Praetorian Guard, and the air was thick with excitement as they arrived to collect their newly assigned \"enhanced\" paychecks. They arrived in a variety of modes - some in ornate chariots, others in sturdy carts, and a few even in what could be described as ancient trucks, essentially large wagons fitted with extra horses. Each Praetorian brought along slaves to help carry their soon-to-be-acquired wealth. But for Sebastianus, what he received wasn't enough. He couldn't carry his sack by himself, but he still envied his colleague for having a slightly larger paycheck. It wasn't by accident that he managed to trip Flavius so that he fell, sprawling his well-earned money all over the room.\n\nSeeing the flying denarii, everyone just lost their minds as the courtyard erupted into chaos. Flavius grabbed Sebastianus by the tunic, and the two soldiers began to wrestle. Their slaves, seeing their masters embroiled in a brawl, took up the fight on their behalf on the square in front of the building. One slave, a hulking brute, tackled another, sending them both sprawling into a cart of hay. The cart tipped over, sending hay and more coins flying into the air. A domino effect followed. More slaves joined the fray, trying to seize as many denarii as they could, alongside the Praetorians who apparently left their dignity in the barracks.\n\n- STOP THIS MADNESS AT ONCE - bellowed the centurion who entered the building, his voice cutting through the din. - YOU ARE SOLDIERS OF THE PRAETORIAN GUARD, AND YOU WILL ACT LIKE THEM. PICK UP THIS SHIT OR I'LL HAVE YOU FLOGGED! DIIISMIIIISED!\n\nThere wasn't any talking with the centurion. An order is an order, and while money gets the Praetorians acting like apes in the zoo, a proper order from their fellow officer makes them docile sheep, obeying every word. The courtyard slowly returned to order; the only signs of the chaos were a few stray coins glinting in the sunlight. As the last of the Praetorians departed, the centurion sighed, shaking his head.\n\n- Payday...- he muttered to himself."

It was here, amidst the most distinguished gladiators from across the country, that the moment would come for the new Emperor to enter the pantheon of Calisian rulers. And he emerged. Clad entirely in purple, wielding a gladius in one hand and greeting the crowds with the other. Many of those who had come knew of the wannabe Emperor's previous exploits. But it didn't matter anymore...\n\n- Greetings, citizens of Calisia! The Emperor of freakfights welcomes you to his humble abode! Today, on this ground, a special battle for another imperial title will take place... - Martinus didn't finish his speech as the announcer interrupted him, wanting to introduce his opponent.\n- AND THE OPPONENT OF OUR EMPEROR WILL BE...\n- HOW DARE YOU INTERRUPT THE EMPEROR, YOU FAT FUCK? - Naimanus couldn't stand this and quickly knocked the announcer to the ground with a punch to the head. He picked up the microphone and continued.\n- Today, the battle for the Empire will take place! That's right, ladies and gentlemen. Whoever wins tonight's fight will be the Emperor. Bring him to me! Come on, you Germanic monkey! Come taste my blade!\n\nAt that moment, his opponent emerged from the wings. A powerful, tall man clad in skins and fur, wielding a two-handed axe that he seemed to barely hold despite his immense stature. Without waiting for any judges, without any signal, Naimanus, with a cry of \"AVE ME,\" charged at the disoriented barbarian. The audience endured three rounds of absolute disgrace where both sides, with the elegance of a drunken kung-fu master, tried unsuccessfully to strike each other with any weapon. Ultimately, in the thirteenth second of the fourth round, the mighty Germanic stumbled over his own feet while attempting to strike at Naimanus. With the posture and movement of a fat swan, Naimanus dove onto the barbarian and actually managed to pierce his throat with his sword. Covered in blood, he rose triumphantly and began to goad the crowd into chanting his name.\n- YEEEEES, YEEEEES! AVE CAESAR MARTINUS NAIMANUS! WITNESS ME! YOUR EMPEROR!\n\nUnbeknownst to the cheering masses, and perhaps to the Martinus himself, the entire spectacle had been orchestrated by the Praetorians. The barbarian was little more than a hapless victim, a Germanic warrior caught in the crossfires of political intrigue. Drugged and disoriented, he had stumbled into the arena unaware of the role he would play in the grand scheme of things.\n\nBut for Martinus, it wouldn't have even mattered. As the cheers of the crowd washed over him like a wave, he basked in the glow of his newfound glory. For a brief moment, he felt like a true Emperor, the ruler of all he surveyed. And as he gazed out at the adoring throngs, Martinus knew that this was only the beginning of his reign..."

The Empire has been reshaped anew; an internal political revolution changed everything only for very little to change in the end. New residential buildings have risen on the outskirts of Calisia's fire-ravaged center, but some areas remain abandoned long after the ill-fated events that culminated in the Praetorian coup, looking no different now than any other ancient ruins.\n\nEach passing day becomes an ever greater test of patience for the ordinary citizens. But fear proves to be a powerful tool, used by the Praetorians who repeatedly drag someone onto the streets for arrest, beating, and humiliation, even if the person has done absolutely nothing wrong. The effect of shock and omnipresent terror works on the citizens, who turn the other cheek in accordance with Christian commandments. But catholic beliefs can't help them. Even Jupiter almighty cannot do it as the domain of men is beyond his ethereal reach.\n\nIt's a very hard time, especially when the prominent Emperor Martinus Naimanus appears on the streets, for whom there wasn't a week that went by without him making his presence felt. Now, devoid of any scruples and above all legal constraints, he could play god walking among his minions. Apart from his self-made pompous image as a great warrior-gladiator and his fondness for fighting in staged arena battles, Naimanus's simplicity and aggression showed even in the ordinary moments of life. He could beat someone up while standing in line simply because he felt like it and the queue was too long. It didn't matter that he didn't need to stand in that queue. A pretext wasn't needed, and no one pretended otherwise anymore.\n\nThe administration miraculously holds itself together, probably mainly because, paradoxically, the Praetorians decided to endorse the decentralization of power by pushing local warlords to the forefront while they ruled from the shadows, where it was most convenient for them. Therefore, the power in this country is exercised not only by the emperor but also by local warlords and governors, yet it lies solely in the hands of Praefectus Cinastovicus. Everyone knows this, but no one can speak it out loud. Because they know that if they do, they might wake up the next morning at five in the morning to brew tea for the Frumentarii agents who will come to arrest them. And not even the omnipresent corruption, which allows the wealthy to deal with their most depraved affairs, will help. Because such a rotten system needs rotten people while simultaneously creating them. Slavery on a massive scale was just the cherry on top, and ordinary citizens were increasingly falling into slavery, having no other way out.\n\nAnd no one will see any way out anytime soon."

There was wine, music, even electricity, not to mention excellent slaves: Pliant girls and boys willing to obey their masters' every command.\n\nNo more. Petrus took his boys, and Titus left with the girls. Their parents barely saw either of them, and it's not like Titus spent much time at home anyway. The Praetorian duty called, and he answered: This country was no longer whole. The one thing keeping it together was destroyed by Titus' leaders. From the Imperator's bloated cadaver, oily discord flew and split apart friends, families... Calisia.\n\n He had no illusions that he would see his brother again. He hoped he wouldn't. He was Vinicius' man, and Titus was Cinastovicus'. The next time they'd meet would be as enemies.\n\n As he was packing his things, he went snacking in his mother's kitchen: It'd be possibly the last time I'd taste home cooking without an obligatory libation with my comrades. As I walked in, she just finished making me my favorite dish in silence. I try to strike up a conversation, but she says nothing. Weather, father, Titus... nothing works. She just hands me my oven-roasted sandwiches just the way I like them. The most awkward meal I had ever had.\n\n I stand up when finished, and at last, the old woman at the dusk of her life speaks up. \n\n- This family, this country, these cunts you two call masters, whoever they are... They will never stop fragmenting. Never stop fighting. Never stop splitting. They broke this family and everything this country once was. And you throw your life away for one of them. \n\n She followed more than enough political happenings to know where things were and where they were going. Mourning. Sorrow. No scorn, though. Even now, when Mother spoke in the most dejected and mournful way imaginable, she was not scornful. I wasn't a disappointment.

Now, he was as much a barbarian as the worst of them, and through the cold and the brutality of his journey, he mastered the animalistic arts. How to stay warm without drawing attention. How to see the threats coming before anyone else ever could. There was a sort of... peace in this animalism. The more he immersed himself in surviving, the less his past traumas hurt.\n\nAnd yet... Whenever he thought he was safe, he mourned the taste of bread and butter, pork chops and chicken tenders, enjoyed with... NO NO NO!\n\n\nCalm. Breathe deep. Cannot lose focus. So what if he's in Legionary territory now? Danger could be anywhere. People. Animals, not so much. Wolves fear humans, and so do bears if you know what you're doing. Anything smaller is food. We are the apex predator. We are... \n\n\nHe came out of the forest to watch the meadow, and then he realized: Ahead of him was an honest to god hamlet, soaked in dawnlight. He could tell from the peaceful and orderly streets that it was inhabited and well-off. He could at last... No. He wasn't done until he reached Cracovia through the marches. His stomach grumbled. He was underfed for the better part of the week. But so what... Through the streets, he marched. Home after home next to him by the pathway, each a humble thatched abode... the hunger... why are the legs giving up... no... \n\n\n He woke up in a comfy bed. It felt so strange... he forgot all about the feeling after the weeks on the cold ground or trees where his only sheets were ants. The room was cluttered and dewy as if he was at least 80 years back in time. Yet.. it was quaint. A warm smell invited him to the kitchen, the homely bake agitating his starved stomach.\n\n- Traveller, be seated. You must be famished. Come. My salt and bread are yours. Eat. You're safe now.\n\n The old grandma placed some bread and salted butter before him in her veil and kitchen apron. He looked at her as if he just saw a ghost, but all he was reminded of was his own late grandma and her perfect pies and pastries.

As inconspicuous as he can be.\n\nWith the food being this scarce in the Western provinces, especially near the capital city, one may understand why roving raiders wreak havoc upon the country. The control is minimal, and food is scarce. But given the countryside is where the food is grown, this only exacerbates the problem of food.\n\nFor a man on the run, broken by the loss of his family, the only way to go is south, where food is not scarce. With no one to go to, he may as well join the legions of Vinicius. He'd certainly not join the armed forces of The Senate, which let this happen to him in the first place.\n\nHe picks up the sleeping bag, quickly munches on his sorry excuse of a cracker breakfast, and presses southward through the forest. No car? No problem: The highwaymen would probably find it even easier to catch him on the road.\n\nMinutes. Hours. As he marched on, eyes looking around for signs of trouble, he lost all sense of time. His whole world was him, the forest, anything that could be a threat. He was wise enough to strap himself: the gun by his side was a glorious Beretta. He even had binoculars. Time was nothing to him. Minutes were hours. Hours went by like minutes. Until...\n\nA clearing. The grotesque visage that somehow eluded Marius until he was right on its precipice featured four fireplaces and a totem in the middle. Or no... a human. Right? He was dead. Strapped to the totem. Was it morbid curiosity that overtook Marius? Suicidal stupidity? Never mind; He approached. The man's head: the top must have been half-sawed, and steel spikes were tacked on. The body was gaunt, skeletal even, mangled, unclothed fully, not at all a man's, more like the trunk of a young tree or the totem behind him. And the limbs... Those weren't limbs. Those were bones, stitched together, bone after bone, protruding from...\n\nWhat little Marius ate came out as barf in front of the figure facing him: A sacrifice to what may as well have been a barbarian god. He saw the shish kebabs near some fireplaces. Still vomiting, he ran and retrieved them. The meat appeared well-cooked but unlike anything he had ever eaten. He felt a sense of wrongness as he stashed the shish kebabs in his bag. And, unwilling to investigate the horror any further, he took his bag and ran as far away as possible. After a few hundred meters, he could hear wild screams and the cries of a girl from whence he came: His daughter flashed before his eyes. No matter. This feeble pain will not dissuade him. He had to keep living for their sake. He can help no one but himself... but once he came to his senses, knowing he abandoned his family and yet another victim, and that he might profane the sanctity of the human body again... He feared surviving, knowing he might no longer be distracted from his demons by having to endure the fear and hunger."

Perhaps it made sense that they were once the Empire's secret police. Maybe the best way to catch a spy is a clandestine mind.\n\n All this went out the window when the Triumvirate came about. Calisia is gone. All that's left is the further fission of the once-grand vision. Nothing expresses that better than the Praetorian system. No more united than a confederacy, its administrative and legal framework comprised an amalgamation of warlords: Men who earned their position not by rhetoric and administrative dominance but by crude charisma and superior firepower.\n\n No erudition. At best, they excelled in natural intelligence and low cunning. At worst, they were simpletons existing as pawns in the Praetorian chessboard. The Praetorians levied tribute from the seat of Constantia, the city of refurbished highrises and white concrete. They got around their administrative limitations by playing to their spymaster strengths: Retreat to the shadows where they are at their best and let the warlords take it from there.\n\n A girl on the run after defending herself from the thugs of one warlord had only one recourse: Volunteer for the Praetorians, where she'd most often be made either an infiltrator-servant or a prostitute spy. The warlord yokels would either extort a man who wanted to sell or produce and still fall to their power struggle, or that man would hope to secure a contract with the Praetorians directly. The warlords wallowed in poverty, despotism, and tyranny that Calisians once believed was only exhibited by barbarians, and the Praetorians wouldn't have it any other way. A wealthy warlord was a threat unless other warlords were at his throat, so he had no negotiating power against his masters. Internal strife boiled over in skirmishes and hitjobs, and public safety was no more, save for the major cities. The Praetorians moved the chess pieces from the shadows, propping up some warlords and bringing down others. All for no purpose but to advance Praetorian leverage. The chessboard that was this part of Polonia became a lawless hellhole where no life was safe, and prosperity was a distant memory. Its chess pieces thus remained under the control of the solo player, Cinastovicus. \n\n The Great Game moved on, and while it played, the Praetorians reigned supreme in tyranny."

The stonework of the walls was inscribed in pre-Calisian devotionals, carved skulls, and what appeared to be tombstones. All the better.\n\nVinicius stepped ahead, his sandals letting him feel the cold granite beneath. Cold and hard. As it should be. As Vinicius should be, as befits his role as the master of the Legions. An unrelenting, unstoppable force that brought back an ancient era against all odds and all predictions. That which used to be Polonia was said to have fallen far. The Legions are proof it's merely fulfilling its destiny.\n\nAn old man spreads incense and petals over the altar, his ancient chants pagan-inspired. Were they genuine prayers to Mars and Jupiter? Not the point. The real point coursed in Vinicius' veins.\n\nHe approaches the altar. A rusty but serviceable steel bowl. Candles around for even more light.

He would pierce right through the watchful eyes of the legionary guards and infiltrate their camp...while dressed as a bush. He sat on the relatively arid road in his bush disguise. The area was hilly and treeless, almost like a meadow degenerating into a savanna. The base was half a kilometer away, behind a perimeter of fence gate and barbed wire. The legionary would spend a minute standing guard turned one way. Then, he'd change positions: This is when Ioannesulus was on the move, rustling, crouched, crawling. As soon as the guard would look his way, he'd drop down. The deranged game of red light-green light saw the yokel of a guard ponder whether bushes on the road were changing places whilst the village loon acting as a spy crept up ever closer in his haphazard disguise.\n It's not like Ioannesulus even asked for the job. He was one of the few whose fate improved after the Fall. In the past, living as a city's dorm janitor, he was cast down and dismissed as mentally challenged, differently abled, and all that horseshit. Everyone said they felt bad for him: No one wanted to have anything to do with him. No, he can't go to a birthday party: they'd just dismiss him and make up excuses like he didn't know what they were doing.  After the Fall, having moved back to his village, he ended up as everything the city acquaintances feared he'd be. A clown. A village idiot. He knew as much. But he also knew the village would do the one thing that the city folks would never even consider - accept him as part of the village. \n\n The Praetorians seemed no different when they offered him a job like this. Get paid. Make a friend. Why not? He was just going to try to get into the military base.\n And he almost did, until suddenly a vehicle drove up from the opening gates. And it stopped. And a centurion, stepping out, kicked poor Ioannesulus' disguise off of him. \n\n What happened to the poor fellow didn't matter anymore. The guard and the centurion focused their attention on him, asking pointless questions from his point of view, shouting on and on. He seemed not to even hear them.\n- Excuse me, what are you doing here? - he asked on and on in response to their words, whatever they were.\nAnd then, finally: \n- O!\n The men decided to drive Ioannesulus away, bringing him closer to his village.

Everything went right, almost too right: The Faba maneuver made my insertion seamless. You were right. It appears the village idiot told them nothing and we're safe from being compromised.

No time to enjoy the scenery, time to jog back to base. Chant words of praise for Vinicius. Chant death to the Praetorians and their Senate curs. Then, the usual day routine. Latrine duty; food that smells like it came from the aforementioned latrine. Another recruit got sent to disciplinary, apparently told his centurion he got lost on his way to Berolinum. Guess who had the distinct 'pleasure' of administering lashes.\n\nLike a thatch gets dark over years of use, so do our tents in my eyes. The monotony of a soldier's life kills me. I'm so bored I can't stay awake. I'm so agitated I can't sleep. The perfect state for a soldier: Maybe I'll end up sleeping with one half of my brain and keeping guard with the other.\n\nUntil then, follow all the unwritten rules they don't write about in the primers. The last sip of liquor is always for your commanding officer. Sleep whenever you can. Sleep standing if you're able to. Do not mate with barbarians; do not mate with animals. Yeah, some fuckers even had to be told that. Don't volunteer for anything in a combat zone unless you prefer being remembered over living.\n\nAnd then... in place of cheap moonshine, they delivered wine. In place of what had to be dog food, they brought pork chops and Gaulish fries to the table. Crunchy, delicious fries. And then we knew. All this yarning on and on about the evils of the Praetorians and Caletus was about to materialize.\n\nVinicius knew what he was doing. Get us used to a soldier's lot, as shit and heavy as it can be. Then, pamper us just a bit. Pump us up before the escalation as the hated Triumvirate breathes its last. What was it for anyway? Oh, right: So Caletus has it his way, and Vinicius' rampage against the Imperator's murderers is thwarted.\n\nBoiling hate of the agitators. Slop in the mess hall. Cries of fools who insulted their centurions. The whip. The anticipation of Vinicius visiting. The training, the sleepiness, the exhaustion. It all ends. Something much worse begins. I will probably not sleep for days once the slaughter begins.\n\nBut between a chance to let out my pent-up anger on the Praetorian scum and a chance to be riding into the Eternal City with Vinicius triumphant..."

calisia.112.t: "Evocatio Militaris"
calisia.112.desc: "- Enemies at 4 o'clock! - centurion Pretium ordered.\n - For Vinicius! For Calisius! - the men responded by shooting at the positions of the soldiers loyal to the Praetorians.\nThey could count on the VPM Mantichoras supporting them. Until they were destroyed by the enemy anti-tank launcher. Nevertheless, after a brief fire exchange, the soldiers loyal to the Legate of the Legio XIX drove their enemies away to deeper defensive positions. Among them was legionary Ioannis Saponis. He was a less-than-stellar shooter, but not much could be expected from someone who got quickly picked up off the streets to fill the gaps in the front. After all, Vinicius needed as many men as possible to triumph against the two other Triumvirs, even despite his reported strategic prowess.\nAs soon as Ioannis approached the former positions of the enemy in the trenches, he began checking the corpses of Cinastovicus's soldiers. He was looking for the body of his cousin, Constantius, who fought on the opposing side. As fate would have it, he was assigned to Constantia's garrison while Ioannis stayed with his family in Cracovia. When Calisia fell apart, no Triumvir cared for the bounds of blood. Their ambition was all that mattered. What else? Vinicius claimed he warred for honor and revenge for the Emperor's death. This didn't add up with the fact he had legalized it as tyrannicide with his signature.\nThankfully, none of the dead soldiers bore the face of Constantius. One corpse's head was mutilated beyond recognition. Ioannis felt nauseous, but he had to check.\nThe dog tag wasn't his cousin's. Now, Ioannis knew Constantius wasn't killed, at least not by his hand.\n- Bene, enough graverobbing. Show those... Let's shoot the bastards! - one of his squadmates shouted.\nHaving secured a relatively safe position in the captured trench, he fired a few potshots before pretending his gun jammed. He wasn't ready to give up on his peace of mind just yet. Soon, the prefect's men retreated beyond the sight of Vinicius's troops.\n - You there! - Decanus Manes looked at Ioannis. - Why weren't you shooting?.\n - Err, my gun jammed. - Someone must've told on him. No matter. He smeared the old Corvus rifle so it would be jammed for real. At least that's what he hoped for.\nFortunately for him; he was right.\n\nSaponis knew he couldn't fight like this. Not while he was worried sick about his family member on the other side of the front. He didn't want to desert Vinicius's army while he was being transported to the front, as then, he'd have to rely on robbery to survive. But now that he was so close to the frontlines, he really considered the prospect of defecting to the other side. He cared little for each Triumvir's cause, but no one asked his opinion, and if he had to fight for someone, he might as well fight for the side his cousin was on."

calisia.113.desc: "Vinicius was waiting on his chair in his tent in the military camp near Holstin. While he had all the power to sit on the throne in Constantia, he wanted to postpone courtly life as long as he could. Also, he wanted to deny his incoming guest the honor of being judged in such a dignified place as a palace. The one he awaited arrived quicker than expected.\n - We found him, sir. He tried to escape the realm by sea! - Vinicius' soldiers brought the prisoner before their Legate.\n - You should've known snakes aren't able to swim.\n - As a matter of fact, they are - his joke was stopped by the Legate's punch - I thought you'd focus more on Caletus, given how you were at each others' throats.\n - It was just a ruse. I'm an actor, you know. And he was really pissing me off. - Vinicius approached the map - Not to mention Constantia was so much closer to the frontlines than Calisia.\n - Why are you doing this? - Cinastovicus tried to find a comfortable position for his tied arms. - Are you that power-hungry?\n - It's not about power. I'm dispensing justice - he pointed a spatha towards the former prefect's throat - against those who killed the greatest man in post-war Polonia, a man who ended the chaos of the Fall, who had an actual vision for the future.\n - Who finally made a second-class actor relevant again. - another strike, now with a pommel, landed on Cinastovicus's face - You won't bring him back. This escapade will end only with more lives lost and the unnecessary deaths of the Praetorians and Optimates, and then, there won't be anybody to govern what's left of Calisius's dream. Is that how you protect his legacy? Is that the price for your sense of justice?\n - If you think you can save yourself, you must know you're only making me angrier. Soldiers, gag him! - The legionaries put a rag in the Praetorian's mouth.\nKilling the father of a nation is as bad as any other patricide, if not worse. - Vinicius was now monologuing uninterrupted - the Romans of old had a suitable penalty for such crimes. I'm talking about Poena Cullei. When we get back to Constantia, you will be put in a sack with a few animals and thrown into the Vistula. Then, the people will show your corpse some appreciation. - As Vinicius was talking, Christianus's face was getting paler and paler - take him out, men.\nAfter they left, Vinicius, smirking, was looking at the strategic map on the table, awaiting a confrontation with Caletus."

calisia.114.desc: "One after another, regular soldiers and officers loyal to Vinicius were crucified. The horrific trail went on from Calisia to Cracovia, imitating the path of the defeated armies.\n- Despite this success, Consul Petrus Caletus couldn't see it as a complete victory. Had his men only captured Vinicius, he wouldn't have needed so many executees, but alas, his hand was forced. The 'honorable' Legate committed suicide, piercing himself with his gladius. As it would turn out, Caletus would be denied not only Vinicius's body but also his lands, irking the Consul even further.\n\nAfter some time, the second cause of Caletus' headache arrived.\nCinastovicus wore the finest velvet he could find. If it wasn't for the fact Caletus sat on the throne, you couldn't say who's supposed to be the sovereign.\n- It appears your men didn't apprehend Vinicius on time. - Cinastovicus said cautiously with a strain of smugness.\n - It appears your men have managed to take over his lands, however. - Caletus went straight to the point. - Despite my war effort being superior to yours.\n- It was beyond my control. - The praefectus shrugged his arms as a sign of helplessness. - Either the local governors declared us as the rulers or the local legions surrendered to us. When it comes to land, don't think I'm not aware of your legions marching into my territory in the north.\n - Don't toy with me, you slimeball! You leave nothing up to coincidence or chance. - Caletus, for the time being, ignored his accusations.\n - This whole situation happened by chance. - Cinastovicus defended himself - A spiral of events out of my control. \n - Enough! - Caletus interrupted him once again - The current division of land upsets the balance.\n - Why? All of the lands have been acquired as we've agreed...\n - I want you to acknowledge my rule over the rest of Pomerania and Vartia. - Caletus smiled mockingly. - I'm glad you mentioned it.\n - You have no right! - The Praetorian had finally lost his temper. - I won't allow this!\n - You will! - The Consul stood up. - Unless you want another war. I'm being reasonable here. Just halves of two provinces.\nCaletus approached Cinastovicus, trying to intimidate him.\n- Alright. - Christianus gave up.\n - Great. You still got the better parts, you know. I trust you'll see yourself out.\n After Cinastovicus left, Caletus sat on the throne, still not content at all after another partial victory."

Sitting on the Constantian throne, surrounded by loyal Praetorians, he seemed untouchable. - Untie him.\nVinicius was quite bewildered.\n - Why so gentle? You expect me to kneel before the traitor? Never!\n - You already have once, but that won't be necessary. You've caused quite a mess, and despite your talents, your execution is unavoidable.\n - You have it all figured out, don't you, scum?\n - No, not at all. - The Praefectus seemed honest. - If that were the case, you'd be dead long ago, and I wouldn't have to deal with that buffoon in the west. Already had to give him two of my provinces so he wouldn't have another fuss.\nHe paused to clear his mind from the frustration.\n - What were you trying to achieve? - He turned his head to Vinicius once again. - Remember how I told you the Triumvirate was designed precisely to prevent any singular member from succeeding if he attacked the others? It's not that complicated, even for a simple grunt.\n - Firstly, because fuck you! - The ever-thoughtful Vinicius replied. Cinastovicus remained unimpressed. - Second of all, my breaking of the Triumvirate means the deal is off. Soon, you and Caletus will attack each other. Two traitors at each other throats. Best I could do to avenge the Emperor.\n You're really monotonous, you know that? I'll give you a soldier's death, a shooting squad. Probably much more merciful than what you had planned for me. - He turned his head toward the guards. - Take him to his cell. He's got an execution scheduled for tomorrow."

Things may escalate quickly, and you're too valuable to risk your life, dominus. - The view of the soldiers preoccupied him so much, that was all he could think about on the way to the Institutum Caput Scientiae Nucleariae.\nWhen they arrived, he thanked the driver for his service in a hurry as he rushed to his laboratorium as soon as possible. He passed by the receptionist and the guards without uttering a word. The personnel didn't mind as by now, they were well aware of scientist's quirks.\n- Shall we begin? - he said with a smile as he entered the laboratory.\n - Ah, Aperdomus! - he was greeted by legate Ladislaus Nemus - I was just talking with Mrs. Silvana about her... doubts.\n- What doubts? - Aperdomus was confused.\n - I don't know if we should continue with the project.\n - I'll leave the personal matters up to you. - Nemus headed towards the exit - It's enough I have to make excuses for your antics before the Commision.\n - What do you mean, Leona? - Robertus ignored the soldier.\n - Millions will die if the conflict between the Trium... Duumvirs escalates. - Junior Scientist Silvana replied - this system is not stable, we've seen that before our very eyes! You trust the new emperor? Fine, but we don't know who may succeed or overthrow him.\nRobertus now realized that Ladislaus must have left, so he wouldn't be able to hear any potentially seditious statements from Leona he'd need to report to his superiors.\n- What we do ensures stability. If the other side sees the atomic bomb, they'll rush to help even despite radical political conflicts.\n- That's naive. - She doubted him - What if they won't wait for the instability? What if the war breaks out tomorrow? You must've seen the troops? And the casualties? We will be able to annihilate the other side.\n - That is an argument for speeding up our research! - Robertus was persistent. - The other side has surely started an analogous project, they can't be far behind. Listen to me, Leona. - He grabbed his colleague's arms and looked her in the eyes. - If we succeed, we can end the war before it even begins. The Western World suffered enormous instability and still, the threat of mutually assured destruction stopped everybody from using nuclear weapons, even after the Balutia Incident and that was an amateurish job anyway.\n - It is true, that this is the most probable outcome. - Leona Silvana admitted reluctantly. - However, you have to consider that the carcass of Polonia is home to many, many improbable outcomes.\n She left, leaving the chief of Democritus Project to dwell in his thoughts."

calisia.117.t: "Dictum Factum"
calisia.117.desc: "The delegation of the Optimates marched briskly toward the Praetorian office temporarily housed in the occupied Imperial Palace. However, the room where the meeting was to take place was not exactly a gem of architecture and interior design. The head of the delegation from the Senate, Thaddaeus Scarginscis, was sure that this room had previously been used for holding slaves. This did not bode well for the hospitality of their potential allies, but they had to grit their teeth and put on a brave face, as Consul Caletus had instructed. On the other hand, it was the Praetorians who had extended the invitation for the talks...\nThaddaeus, along with his chief negotiator, Senator Catharina Gaius, and the scribe Camillus, whose surname no one ever remembered, sat waiting for someone with whom they could discuss matters. After fifteen minutes, a young Praetorian entered the room, whom the senators did not recognize. He smiled from ear to ear and promptly apologized for the delay.\n- Excellencies, forgive the chaos. Can I offer you something to drink? Coffee? Tea? Perhaps some wine? - The officer at least seemed polite. Thaddaeus relaxed a bit but wanted to get to the heart of the matter as soon as possible.\n- Thank you very much. We would simply like to discuss our agenda. When will Prefect Cinastovicus arrive? - asked Scarginscis. The officer's face turned crimson, and his smile quickly gave way to a nervous grimace.\n- He will not be coming. I have been instructed to receive your proposals, and everything will be relayed to the Prefect as soon as he returns to the capital. We did not want to postpone the meeting, you know.\n- Very well, then listen to this - Catharina suddenly spoke up. - First of all, there can be no talk of a return to monarchy.\n\nShe paused, keenly observing the officer's reaction. She struck with a hard demand first, but he just continued to stare directly at her, smiling and nodding. This slightly unsettled the senator, but she continued nonetheless.\n- To achieve this, we need to start reinstating pre-Fall solutions. A second chamber of parliament, independent media, seats in companies for Senators, judicial reform, tax reform...\nthe Praetorian kept nodding, listening intently. Thaddaeus wondered how far they could push this, so he added his own insertions:\n- Sanctioned opposition, a tribunal for the Populares and the barbarians, economic reform?\n- Of course! - replied the officer.\n- Do you want to...write this down? - Thaddaeus asked.\n- I'll remember, thank you!\n- Camillus, perhaps you could provide the gentleman with a copy of our proposals. Make sure to pass this on to the Prefect. We will await a response, and now, excuse us, we take our leave.\n\nAnd with that, the delegation handed over their demands and left the Imperial Palace, uncertain but hopeful that their proposals would be seriously considered. The whole discussion was short, rather insulting, and the Optimates made themselves leave the room when all of their demands seemed to be acknowledged and agreed upon. But... they weren't really negotiating."

Can't have anyone starving in the streets, no matter how unfortunate. \n- Mhm, and about the military? \n- In the times of constant conflict, the legions needed every single denarius we could spare. Nowadays, they are mostly a financial drain, and any sensible citizen should support our plan to defund and disband unnecessary units to redirect the money to the people's pockets. \n- Hmm, slightly too populist. There's a risk it might catch on. Try again, less radical this time. \n- Uhh, we cannot disregard our internal security. The barbarian threat may be dormant for now, but it may resurface at any point with newfound strength. We need to play a proactive role. \n- Now you're just regurgitating our party line. You're going to be a member of the Nova Sinistra, Pompeius. Act like a leftist, damn it. Though... a moderate one. A VERY moderate one. \n- We... oh damn it, Eduardus, I don't know what those barbarian-loving sycophants believe. Other than secretly wanting to destroy all of Calisia. But I'm not going to say that... \n- Just mumble something about pay cuts and call the soldiers ungrateful a couple times. Should make you unpopular enough. Alright, final question, what is your stance on the Optimates? \n- I... - He paused for a moment, trying to recall the right answer. - I disagree with the Optimates when it comes to the economic direction they're taking the Empire in, but value their contribution in guiding it through the darkest crisis in our lifetimes. Though our values remain fundamentally opposed to each other, I... uhh... I remain open to cooperation should it be necessary. \n- Good. But you should have it fully memorized now. You sound like you're reading from a script. But wouldn't you say the Optimates were complicit in the murder of Emperor Ricardus and responsible for undemocratic political purges of their opposition? \n- Umm, we were, Eduardus. And it was glorious, too. Even captured one of their Senators myself, I tell ya. The fear on his face was sublime. \n- Is that what you're going to tell the journalists, you dimwit? That the leader of the main opposition party was one of the instigators of the Ides? From now on, if I hear even a single slip-up, you are done, Pompeius. And I don't just mean politically. \n- Yes, yes, sorry, I'm just a good, obedient leftist. \n- Listen, tomorrow, you'll head to the municipal clerk and register your party.

Among them was a family of Hlodowig Smiþa, or at least that's what the Calisian bureaucrats insisted on calling him. Each patriarch of the family was supposed to approach the official and draw a lottery ticket. Simple mass exile would be less degrading than this show. From what Hlodowig determined by observing the previous rounds, the most common 'prize' to win was expulsion from the Republic. What kept people's hopes up was the fact not all expulsion tickets were created equal. They had different dead-ends. Some forced the families to leave their homes by the end of the week. Some: by the end of the month. And some gave the 'Germanics' a half-year time period to leave Calisia before being brutally driven away by the army. But there were some tickets, usually reserved for one family, that would allow them to remain in Calisia to live a prosperous life.\n\nWaiting for your turn was a nightmare.\nMolinarius - a month. Sniþar - Half a year. Wagnar - Half a year. Svanir - Can stay.\n- Smiþa! - the commander of legionaries called out the name of Hlodowig.\n- Daddy... - little Hildigardu was distressed.\nHer father gently squeezed her hand before letting his wife, Cludhildu, cheer the girl up. Then, he approached the ticket container. He slowly reached with his hand. He carefully chose the paper as if that would change anything. And he finally drew.\n- Smiþa - a week! - The commander read the text on the cursed ticket.\nHlodowig ran to his crying family, trying to comfort them.\n\nBefore packing the rest of his things, the soon-to-be exile decided to drown his sorrows in the bar. And he had company. Oleifr Svanir decided to celebrate his victory in the same bar. Just like Hlodowig, he poured himself a copious amount of alcohol. And he was really obnoxious in that state, shouting and jumping on the tables. It wasn't long before he approached Smiþa.\n- YEAH! Who won the lottery? I DID! Smell that air! Couldn't ya just drink it like wine? HAHAHAAA! Ain't gonna see me crossing the Viadrus, uh uh! That's for loooooosers!\nHlodowig quickly had enough of his insulting ramblings. He didn't deserve to leave Calisia while disrespectful scum like Svanir were allowed to stay. And if the republican apparatus can't ensure that, he will. After all, he had nothing to lose. With this conclusion, he reached for his pocket knife and attacked the lucky winner, shanking him to death in the bar."

Marcus couldn't resist such idiotic comments. \"You dropped three zeroes, here you go, help yourself - 000\", and after a while, he responded. \"600 denar\", and when he didn't get any response, he just wrote \"then fuking sit on it yuself bye fukor\"\n\"Legionarius_MM\" chimed in with: \"how much for throne, i can give you 500k\"\n\"500 000 denarii, it's in the description,\" Marcus typed back, and he didn't know how to react when the guy responded \"WHAT?!!

They started to think it would be a better deal if they were just to take the throne to sell it for scrap. Or try to sell it abroad. Perhaps there would be someone interested for real, so they would not have to lose their minds while trying to figure out whether the person they're writing with is a halfwit, an amoeba, or a barbarian."

He walked through the corridors, curiously looking at the studios he passed by. On his right, he heard sports news about another victory of the Greens in the chariot races and the riots it caused in the city. On his left, he saw a news studio reporting the latest news from the limes. Two rooms down, there was a studio adapted for broadcasting propaganda content from the Empire abroad. But his destination was one of the largest rooms - the main Nuntia newsroom.\n\nEveryone welcomed him like a herald of good news because that's what he was - a harbinger of positive change that would put Calisia back on the path of lawfulness and democracy.

The barbarians envy our prosperity, Tusc's trial will take place next week, and the Legionaries win more battles on the limes. Everything is fine.

calisia.123.desc: "When Vinicius arrived at Calisius's palace, the crowd had already gathered in the yard. No one dared to touch his body despite the newsreader's allusions.\n- Make way for the Legate - his soldiers quickly dispersed the crowd.\n- It's Vinicius! - one of the gathered noticed.\n- The Calisius' ally! - another one pointed out.\n- Have you come to disavow your master?\n- Will you protect his good name?\n\nMarcus Vinicius approached Calisius's body. He clenched his fist in rage, looking at his former Emperor. His former friend. Had he done what he wanted, he would've raised his gladius and yelled at the crowd to make short work of the traitors that did this. But he couldn't.\nIn the distance, he could notice a sniper, certainly waiting to take him down had he said something 'traitorous.' And there were surely some undercover frumentarii operatives to justify his death. He had to be subtle, and subtlety was not Marcus Vinicius's way. But he didn't need to speak as Marcus Vinicius. Paweł Deląg was an actor, and he knew whose lines should be spoken at this moment."

calisia.321.desc: "- I come to bury Calisius, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones; So let it be with Calisius. The noble Caletus Hath told you Calisius was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Calisius answer'd it. Here, under leave of Caletus and the rest - For Caletus is an honourable man; So are they all, all honourable men - Come I to speak in Calisius's funeral.\n\nHe was my friend, faithful and just to me. But Caletus says he was ambitious; And Caletus is an honourable man. He hath brought many captives home to Calisia. Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill? Did this in Calisius seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Calisius hath wept. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Caletus says he was ambitious; And Caletus is an honourable man.\n\nI speak not to disprove what Caletus spoke, but here I am to speak what I do know.\n\nYou all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him? O judgment! Thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their reason. Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Calisius, and I must pause till it come back to me.\n\nHere's a parchment with the seal of Calisus; I found it in his closet, 'tis his will - let but the commons hear this testament - which, pardon me, I do not mean to read - and they would go and kiss dead Calisius's wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood\n\n- We'll hear the will: read it, Marcus Vinicius. - a person from the crowd cried.\n\n- The will, the will! We will hear Calisius's will. - the whole crowd roared.\n\n- Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it; It is not meet you know how Calisius loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men; And, being men, bearing the will of Calisius, it will inflame you, it will make you mad. 'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs; For, if you should, O, what would come of it!\nThe crowd had already been driven to the verge of madness caused by grief. Vinicius thought it was time for the grand finale.\n- If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. - Vinicius uncovered Calisius's body, and the furious crowd attacked nearby the Praetorians, starting a riot in the city."

The servants were working as hard as they could to make sure the place lived up to the common idea of imperial standards, despite the fact no Emperor currently resided in it.\n - By Jupiter, am I glad he's gone. - Consul Petrus Caletus thought to himself, raising a glass of wine, undertaking the long and arduous task of emptying Calisius's storages. - And the way they finished him, brilliant. It's hard to believe they were Cinastovicus's men.\n\n The leader of the Praetorians usually prefers staging careful plots that are too complicated for Caletus's taste. After all, why bother with all that planning when a few slashes across the torso do the job just fine.\nHe took another sip. He successfully completed most of his plans, so he could allow himself some indulgence for his achievements. After all, thanks to him, tyranny was over, the Calisian population was safe from the barbarian invasion, and peace was secured. More or less. He still had to deal with Vinicius and Cinastovicus, but how hard could that be? Sure, he needs them to govern the realm, but they need him even more. Vinicius is popular, and Cinastovicus has a lot of power, but Caletus is the only full-blooded politician among them. A politician with a tight grasp on the most important provinces in the Empire.\n\n - This should be easy - Caletus said, finishing his wine and heading to the negotiating room, awaiting his guests."

calisia.125.t: "Last Aurochs"
calisia.125.desc: "As Vinicius was riding through the city toward the Imperial Palace, the crowd cheered. It was one of the few applauses he received in recent days that seemed to be genuine. Everyone was ecstatic to see the hero of Calisia arriving in the capital to bring justice.\n- Avenge the Emperor! Avenge Calisius! - a poor man shouted in his direction. He will most likely be apprehended by the Praetorians. Imprisoned for uttering the thoughts he only dared to think. After his speech over Calisius's body, he planned to escape the city with the help of his legions and a popular uprising. However, he soon realized the Praetorians and Optimates created a cordon separating the capital from the rest of Calisia. Trying to break out or in would result in Vinicius's death. The thought of postponing his revenge made him grit his teeth. Unable to think clearly among the rackety crowd and with his head filled with hatred, he tried to embrace the moment. He smiled, waved, and gave some woman a wink - the usual.\n He felt he wasn't ready to face Cinastovicus and Caletus in the Imperial Palace. He ordered his retinue to head to his residence.\n\nOnce he was there, he started to weigh his options. His first instinct was to enter the palace and slit traitors' throats, kill as many of their guards as possible before being slain himself and let the sensible men fix the mess he had caused. But there were no sensible men left. Calisius, Compa, Hvedorcus are all dead. Somehow, he - the least ideologically driven of them became the last light of the Populares' cause. Not because of his own conviction but because it's what Calisius, the man who made him what he is today, would've wanted. He'll do the right thing, even if he doesn't know how.\nUnsure of the future, he decided to head to the palace and see how things play out. To his advantage, the 'Liberatores' probably thought him to be a shameless hedonist with no higher values of his own. For his own benefit, he will play the role they provided for him. And when the time is right, he will drop his mask, to their surprise."

calisia.126.desc: "In the city of Calisia, the crowd was cheering for the arrival of Prefect Cinastovicus - the harbinger of peace and cooperation. Well, the paid shills were doing most of the cheering, and the conforming crowd was doing, at most, an adequate job. No wonder no one liked those in charge of the secret services. Add to that the fact that after the disgraceful coup of Calisius in 2025, Christianus retreated from politics. His reassignment had only ended recently. \nStill, the opinion of the riff-raff wasn't the thing that occupied the Prefect's mind. It was the mistakes of his men, the ones that forced him into this less-than-ideal position. The men responsible were already dealt with, but now, instead of planning to seize all power for himself, he had to smile and wave to the crowd that treated him like some parade platform. All that to enter negotiations that would probably result in some type of collective rule.\n - I worry too much - Cinastovicus could feel the drops of sweat slowly gathering on his forehead. He undermined the position of the father of the nation and even was responsible for his death. Yet still, he was here. Alive. Even despite that lengthy speech Vinicius gave over the Emperor's body. He survived that. Even thrived. He could wait a while longer to achieve his ultimate goal - complete control over Calisia. The fate he deserved before Calisius ousted him from his office. Who stood against him? A buffoon and a traitor, at least in the eyes of the people. Filled with newly found courage, he gave an order to the servants carrying his litter."

calisia.127.desc: "The servants know their duties. The Palace must shine for the arrival of Cinastovicus and Vinicius. They all have been instructed what to do by their autonomous overseers. Caletus had no special wishes regarding the details, just simple cleaning and decorations. Other than that, business as usual. The Consul was busy being smug about the fact that he was the host of such an important event.\n\nWhen Cinastovicus arrived, everything was in the best condition possible. Marble statues were polished, and floors were vacuumed so that not a single speck of dust remained. Cinastovicus, once he arrived, was pleasantly surprised by the scrupulousness he usually didn't expect from Caletus. The prefect entered the room where the negotiations were about to commence.\n - Greetings, Prefectus - Caletus welcomed the first guest. - Have a seat. My butler will serve you wine if you wish.\n- No, thank you - Cinastovicus answered sparingly.\n- No need to be overly temperate. Calisius left quite a stash. - The Consul insisted. - But to each their own. Do you know when Vinicius is supposed to arrive?\n\nLegatus Calisii pro praetore Marcus Vinicius kept the Liberatores waiting for about half an hour before he arrived.\n- Finally! - Caletus didn't hide his irritation. - You didn't get lost, did you?\n - I needed more time to determine how much I'll demand in exchange for not killing you. - The Legate retorted.\n - Now listen here, you legionary grunt!\n- Enough! - Cinastovicus interceeded. - We came here to prevent a civil war, not cause one!\n- I will not let him demean me! - Caletus didn't intend to give up.\n- Let those negotiations proceed, and you'll never have to see each other again! - Now the Praetorian had their attention.\n - What do you want from me? - Vinicius asked.\n- What is a government that acts with no regard for the letter of the law? - Cinastovicus began philosophically. - Just a violent mob similar, or worse, to a barbarian kingdom. That is why all we do must be deemed lawful, and that is why, Marcus Vinicius, we need your signature under this act.\nCinastovicus moved a piece of paper towards the Legate and continued.\n - It's an act of accusation against Ricardus Calisius. It accuses him of tyranny, and if the courts accede to our opinion, and they will, the murder of the Emperor and the mass annulment of Populares-sponsored laws will become lawful and justified acts of preserving the republic. Yet, an accusation from Caletus and I would likely be contested. We need the support of someone credible. Someone whose testimony would give our claim much-needed legitimacy, no matter the ruling of the despised courts.\n- Yeah, we need you to sign it. - Caletus summed up the prefect's lecture.\nMarcus had to think for a while. He was ready to play their little game, but no one would know about it. Will he have any honor left after he complies?\n- What would I get in return?\n- Nah-uh, it doesn't work like that. - Caletus stopped his questions.\n- First, you sign it. - Cinastovicus agreed with his ally. - It's not like you have a choice in the matter."

calisia.128.desc: "\n- Now that I've sold my soul, can you pay me and I'll be on my merry way? - Vinicius stood up readying himself to leave.\n- We need each other to rule - Cinastovicus decided to once again explain himself by talking around the subject - otherwise the Empire will be guranteed to crumble. It's due to its size and the factional conflicts... Calisia cannot be ruled by a single person, but it can be managed by three gentlemen! A triumvirate, if you will. You wanted payment, Vinicius? How about your own piece of the Empire?\nLegate wasn't expecting that turn of events.\n- How do we know, he won't attack us once we give him power? - Caletus asked, agitated that Cinastovicus became the master of the ceremony. - He's already threatened a Consul of Calisia!\n- Easy there - Vinicius said in a very lax tone. Then he grabbed a glass of wine from butler's plate, before the servant was able to put it on table - If I wanted power, I'd have taken it long ago in 2026, before any of you became prominent players. - he took a sip of wine - I'm just an old legionary, just give enough land for my men to cultivate, with high enough revenue, so I can drink, and feast, and whore my way into the grave. Then, I'll be your loyal soldier boy.\n- Even, if he won't - prefefctus went on with the arguments for his proposal - the combined power of the other two Triumvirs will stop the one, who went rogue.\n- If that's the case - Vinicius unsheathe his sword, Caletus reached to grab his expecting an attack.\nVinicius however turned his back to him and approached a wall with a map hanging on it. The Legate began carving it. - I'll take this.\nHe showed the other men a piece that roughly included the teritories of Galicia, Scythia, Vartia and Silesia Superior.\n- The wealthiest, most fetrile and those more or less untouche by the Barbarians? Is this some kind of joke?  - Caletus protested - Cracovia should belong to me.\n- I think the *Consul of Calisia* should preside primarily over the Urbs itself. - Vinicius argued - Besides, I want to rule over my hometown. \n- I won't hand over Vartia and Silesia Superior to you. I'll need them while rebuilding the western parts of the Empire.\n Fine, I won't need the province with atomic crater anyway - then he turned his head towards Cinastovicus - Looks like two of us gets a historical capital in their domains. It is only fair that you get one as well - he proceeded to carve a north western portion of Calisia and showed it to the praetorian.\n - The recent... upheavals caused much of the local administration to deteriorate, but I'll manage.\n - We're settled, then? - Caletus asked and then answered without confirmation - Great, because I've scheduled a meeting with the people to show our newly achieved unity. Just head to the balcony in half an hour, salute and wave a bit and the crowd should buy it."

Our empire is a step closer to unification! Soon, the other half of the Calisian domain will bow to its rightful ruler!\nThe people began to slowly crawl out of their hiding spots among the ruins. They were full of doubt, after all, they had already been given guarantees of peace once. Nevertheless, having realized the soldiers weren't going to shoot the civilians, more and more citizens emerged.\nThe centurion gazed at them, most likely expecting them to cheer for the new government. The thing was, the survivors that gathered weren't able to distinguish which side won, given the fact all of their uniforms were so similar. The dust coming from destroyed buildings wasn't particularly helpful either. Finally, someone in the crowd, being fairly well-informed about the movement of the troops, shouted:"

Back then, the Senate was at least democratic.\n\nNow all that the Prefect could see was the Populares weaseling their way into total control over the Senate. Barbarians. They were a stain on what made Calisia great. They were a nightmare for the Guard to deal with, and now they were not only coddled like babies but also used as a political tool. And what did the Emperor do about it? Nothing. He smiled and waved as his empire fell to moral ruin. \n\nHis portrait hung mockingly from the wall of Christianus' office. That sickly sweet smile of an old man who could barely rule his own empire. He was fed up with him in every way imaginable, and he knew others who shared that opinion, some Optimate Senators, and definitely the other members of the Guard. \n\nThat's when it struck him. What good is he even? What did the Emperor even do for Calisia since its founding? He was a drain on the nation's funds, and when his intervention would've actually been useful, he sat by and watched his beloved Populares rip Calisia to shreds. If only they could cut out the fat, remove some of the excess, to say. Wouldn't things just be so much easier without that bejeweled roadblock? Christianus started pacing around his office, a plan formulating in his mind.\n\nBut then what of the barbarians? The Populares? Worst of all, Vinicius? The barbarians would need to take the blame for Calisius' death. So then, the Populares would inevitably be caught in the backlash. The population would be furious that they technically were the ones who paved the way for his death. Then, in the end, there's always Vinicius. He's too big of a beacon to just be knocked out. They'd need to bribe him somehow, then somehow get him out of the picture. \n\nAfter all that... Someone would need to take the reins. Though the idea of ruling by his own decree was tempting, that would just ruin any sense of his credibility. They'd either need to find themselves a new Emperor or fill the Senate with yesmen...\n\nHe needed to make some calls, arrange some meetings. Stavissin sounds nice this time of year."

It was branded as a fun event, where people from all around Calisia could see the Praetorian Guard's finest members from various cities play a full-on volleyball tournament, but it was an easy way to get a bunch of high-ranking Praetorians and Senators together in one room without anyone batting an eye.\n\nThe coach's room was their asylum for the meeting. Cinsatovicus and Scarginscis, the most recognizable members of the guard and the Optimates, second only to Caletus. Others were in attendance, of course, but they would all be playing secondary roles. Cinastovicus took the stand and spoke, standing next to a locker filled with tennis rackets.\n\n- Gentlemen, we all know why we're gathered here today, so I will get to the point. We all have a part to play in this game of ours. The Guard will focus on the procurement of fireworks and pyrotechnics all around the city. Of course, invites for our beloved barbarian friends will also be handled, with the Emperor's seal, of course. We'll make sure they have a splendid time at the triumph. Maybe they'll even get an audience with the Emperor himself. Meanwhile, the Optimates will do what you do best. You'll let the people know just what they need to think about them and about the Emperor. His speech from a few weeks ago could be... misinterpreted... to make him look really bad, and we wouldn't want that, would we now?\n\nA chuckle could be heard across the room. Everyone here was fully committed to putting an end to the \"Tyrant\" Calisius. Though soaked with innuendo, everyone knew just what would happen on that fateful day. The plan was already in motion, there was no going back, and there was time to work. But just for today, they could celebrate.\n\nAs they raised a glass of wine, they were interrupted by a knock on the door. Christianus stepped over, and there stood one of the Praetorians in a purple sports kit.\n\n- Sir, Prefect Cinastovicus, Iulius kicked the goal and broke his leg. We'll need to ask the coach about who we let on the field as a replacement.\n\nThe Prefect stared at him for a moment with a dumbfounded expression, trying to figure out how someone could kick a goalpost while playing volleyball and how he could even kick it so hard that he'd break his leg in the process."

He was so consumed by the thought, he didn't even attend the triumph that was taking place at the Fields of Mars. The people were talking about barbarians getting ready to riot. Maybe Calisius shouldn't have let so many of them in. Or maybe that was just the Optimates' propaganda. That uncertainty was the most frustrating thing for him. He was a fighter leading fighters, and courtly schemes differ considerably from military reconnaissance. Nevertheless, he's sent some speculators to try to gather some clues, even though he knew they couldn't contend with the proficiency of the Praetorians and the Frumentarii, both under Cinastovicus's control.\n- I don't like this. - he said with resignation.\n\nHis ponderings were halted when smoke started to fill his lungs.\nOne of the legionaries entered his room.\n- Legate, the barracks are burning - he was accompanied by the parallel choir of screams and ringing alarms.\nVinicius and the other legionaries managed to exit the barracks, although some were burnt severely. Others never left the building. When they entered the streets, they saw uneven walls of fire consuming the buildings and the vigiles cohorts trying to prevent the spread.\n- Alright, boys! - Vinicius was still able to issue commands despite the decreasing amount of breathable air - All of you who weren't burnt. Go to the vigiles and offer yourself as help. Those with only mild burns, help the severely injured legionaries. Let's go!\nVinicius' men helped immediately. They carried bodies, tended to the wounded, helped with carrying civilians, and hacked through the locked doors. The situation seemed under control.\n- Help! Help!\nAn old lady stuck on the third floor screamed as she was unable to get out of her house. All of the legionaries and vigiles were preoccupied with ensuring the fire wouldn't spread or helping those in critical condition.\nAll of them, except Vinicius.\nThe Legatus ran to the entrance of the woman's house before any of his men realized what was happening. With a few swift swings of his gladius, he cut through the door already weakened by fire. Vinicius looked at the staircase. The fire didn't spread there as much. The situation was manageable even without protective gear. He carefully proceeded upstairs and forced the apartment door open. He found the lady in her room, sitting in a wheelchair. He picked her up and carried her out of the apartment.\n - We're getting close - he tried to comfort the rescuee as they went down onto the second floor.\nIndeed the way outside was within Vinicius's line of sight as he said that. Despite that, he wasn't able to make any further step before the last line of stairs collapsed under him.\n\nThe last thing he heard was frightened legionaries shouting his name in panic."

Considering the advanced age of Ricardus, he was visiting more often recently. But some wounds even the best doctors can't heal.\n- You know, doctor, I feel tired... I feel so... tired. Like ketchup spread over too much bun. I can't even get out of bed without it being a fight against myself. \n- More reasons you should rest and try not to stress. And honestly, you should also lay off fast food. You need to keep yourself in good form.\n\nBut Ricardus Calisius wasn't really listening. In his thoughts, he was drifting away to past memories, trying to figure out which moments led him to the situation he was finding himself in. He never really cared for his health, and no doctors were going to change that, no matter who the Optimates would send to try to trick him into incapacitation. What is richness, if not another form of prison?\n- They gave me everything. I live in a palace and have my own servants. Do you know how many bedrooms are in here? Seventeen! Who needs all that?! If I want cooked guineafowl for dinner, they'll get me one. If I want the best wine in all of Europa, there you go! If I want to go out for a walk, suddenly I can only wander through my gardens and menagerie.\n- Doesn't sound that bad...- responded Dr. Hastius, confused as to what he could even say in this case. It's like there is a party in someone's house, and you really need to go, but your companion keeps on talking, and talking, and talking. It gets awkward. That's what the doctor was feeling right now. And it was getting more intense with each passing minute.\n\n- Bad... Was I? A bad father? A bad ruler? I always tried my best. Maybe I was too harsh. Or sometimes too lenient. Or... ignorant? They've reduced me to a shell of a man. Back in the pre-Fall days... gods, I was strong back then! I could eat a whole pig by myself. Now, I can barely taste anything. It's like everything has lost its flavor. There are only black and white colors, and I'm unable to do anything about it! Maybe they are right... maybe my time has come, and I should just vanish into the dustbin of history. But I wanted to do so many things before the end! Eh... let's face it - everything I have ever done was wrong and bad in some way or another. Even if I had good intentions. Especially then. No one really appreciated me being in charge, and I gather... I haven't either. Is there any hope for me yet, doctor?"

Today, the last, most prominent of the Optimates' foes stood among them on the palace balcony, defeated, with a fake smile directed at the crowd, trying to reassure them everything was in order while internally screaming for help. \n\n- Wave that hand more eagerly, you glorified puppet! - Consul Caletus sneered while pressing a dagger into the Emperor's side. - They love you, you know. Oh, think how disappointed they'd be to find out the one they revere is nothing but our faction's obedient little servant. \n\nFor a moment, Ricardus Calisius considered fighting back. In front of the whole crowd, he could try setting himself free. The people would see him struggling, and they'd surely back him over those unlawful usurpers. But what would happen then? Caletus would surely panic and immediately pierce his heart, while the riots could escalate into a full-blown civil war at any moment. Was that to be his legacy? For the good of Calisia, he gritted his teeth and let the Consul continue degrading him. \n\n- Look at the scene before us, Ricardus. Beautiful, isn't it? All this glory, all this cheering... you have me to thank for making it all possible. And now, watch this! \n\nBehind the soldiers, a parade float drove into view, revealing an oversized, overly buff monument of Petrus Caletus, holding his sword up to the sky in a gesture of victory. Besides the wrinkles adorning his face, largely smoothed out by the sculptors, it bore little resemblance to the Consul, yet that mattered little when faced with the depicted Senator's massive ego. \n\n- It's glorious, isn't it? I should get one where I hold your severed head for all the gods to see. But it's a bit too soon, don't you think? All in due time. - he could barely control his excitement, looking like a child who got their drawing framed up on the fridge for the very first time. \n- You know, I remember all the times you offered me a cup of Latium whenever we met after a particularly contentious bill. I have to say, your taste is almost as bad as your ability to rule. But how about, for old times' sake, we enjoy a sample of that favorite wine of yours? I'm afraid it would sour my refined palate, though it never hurts to have a drink among friends, don't you agree, Ricardus? - he kicked him squarely in the leg. - Now go make yourself useful and bring me a glass, you crown-wearing side character.

Fine bison meat, the closest they could get to feasting on an actual auroch, paired excellently with red Latium. As the two parties sized each other up in silence, looking for any potential weaknesses, they continued their ritualistic dance of perfectly coordinated movements, any failure to follow the hundreds of hidden norms and conventions enough to ruin the standing of the offending individual. Petrus Caletus was the first to break: \n- You know, it's a real shame what happened to your father, Antonius. - He spoke while chewing, upsetting the Prince's sense of order. - I never really took him for much of a traitor. \n- Yes, a shame. - Antonius replied in a courtly, calculated tone. - But we can't have barbarians infiltrating the Empire. It was harsh, for sure, but necessary. \n- Gah! At least somebody in that fancy palace gets it! - the Senator wiped his spit with a handkerchief, betraying any pretenses of class - If only your brother was this agreeable! \n- You're right, Consul. If only... - he gave his interlocutor a sly smirk - Sadly, his faults make him incapable of taking the throne, don't you think? It's terrifying just how much damage he could do... unless somebody stops him, that is. \n- Are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting? - Petrus Caletus could barely contain his excitement, speaking with his mouth still full while directing threatening gestures at the absent Princeps. \n- A bit more discretion, could you, Consul? Good. Now, I have the slightest suspicion you didn't just invite me over for a friendly conversation. Let me guess, my father has been getting quite... vocal about his disapproval of the current power balance. Perhaps you even prepared a list of generous offers to potentially make me cooperate. Well, I have a better deal for you, Senator. Ricardus is irredeemable, you see. So is Ignatius. But, of course, the Optimates do not have to accept a monarch that is harmful to the Empire. If they were to put their weight behind a candidate more aligned with their interests, Calisia could really start to bloom. \n- Hmm, but who could we possibly put forward? - He asked sheepishly. - There's nobody with a legitimate claim... \n- Me, you stu... - the Prince barely restrained himself. - You know what, I'll handle the talking. Just promise me I'll have your faction's full support once the Emperor is out of the way."

calisia.136.desc: "Fourteen minutes. A new record. Despite all the forced decorum present in the Senate, that is all the time it took for the chamber to devolve into a back-and-forth flurry of insults. While most ideological differences could be overlooked, the barbarian crisis caused both factions to cross the point of no return, something the Optimates were keen to repeatedly let their rivals know. \n\n- Traitors, all of you! Sold us out, sold us all out! Clearly, this Empire means nothing to you because you keep sullying it with barbarian filth! We've been infiltrated, our noble blood diluted by these mutts. And you, Senator Compa, you are nothing but a Germanic agent, a worthless tool of their apocalyptic tide. When Calisia burns, and the last remnants of order are gone, I hope they find their way into your villa so you can watch as they turn your daughter into their own personal whore. \n\nPetrus Caletus was in his element. All those years of restraint may have dulled his combative spirit, but he was glad that, at last, the gloves were off. Every boisterous comment by the dominant Populares, each mocking remark by the Barbares, enflamed a primal rage within him, reducing the framework of a veteran politician to a pool of vitriolic hatred spilling out all over the Senate floor. \n\nYet today, something seemed to be amiss. Rather than levying a single response against his rival, Consul Compa simply sat there, taking in the barrage of ad hominems with almost too much poise, seemingly unfazed by it all. And... what was that smirk? Did he... just reach under the table? \n\n- You barbarian-loving scum, what do you think you're doing, huh? - The barrage from the pulpit continued. - Explain yourself before this chamber! Let every Calisian citizen know that you took their homes, took their dignity, and soon you will replace them with uncivilized halfwits! This will be your end, Consul. I will see to it that you and your accomplices will... \n\nWith a loud thud, the door to the Senate floor swung open. Before the echoing noise subsided, like a wave streaming down to sweep away the Calisian foundation, came the outpour of legionaries, all donning armor far too ceremonial to be of any combat effectiveness, almost as if they were reveling in their role as temporary enforcers of public justice. \n\nMost of the Optimates tried to run, some simply stood in their seats, baffled at the unfolding events. And in the middle of it all, Petrus Caletus continued to huddle the pulpit, his ramblings beginning to sound more and more like desperate pleadings. \n\n- This is a total mockery of law and order! Andrius, I order you to disperse this rabble at once! \n\nSo occupied was the speaker with his demands that he failed to notice the gallant figure slowly approaching his spot. With the overwhelming multitude of medals proudly displayed on his chest, Marcus Vinicius commanded a sense of authority unmatched by even the most decorated of legates. With elegance and decor, effortlessly merging the disparate styles of the court and military, the commander lifted his arm and, with a hint of delayed satisfaction, pushed it straight into the senator's lower jaw, ending his speech mid-word. Limply, without any fanfare, the last bastion of Calisian oligarchism collapsed onto the ground, only to be dragged away in shame like a disobedient child, kicking and screaming."

calisia.137.desc: "As soon as the Emperor announced a trial by combat for one of the most prominent men in the realm, the people went out to buy tickets as soon as possible. And it showed. On the day of the trial, seats filled long before the set hour. People wanted blood. Unfortunately for Christianus Cinastovicus, they wanted his blood.\nThe sun was blazing, heating the sand, giving the accused a foretaste of the hellish fires waiting for him in the afterlife.\nWhen the time came, Calisius began his speech.\n- Citizens of Calisia, before you stands a man accused of high treason, of conspiring with the Optimates to overthrow the Empire and murder the righteous Emperor of Calisia. Fot that he will stand trial before the eyes of the Divine! - the crowd cheered as a sign of approval - His opponent will be the irreplaceable, the undefeated; Marius Pudianus Dominator!\nThe audience went wild when they heard the name of the hero of the common folk.\nCinastovicus's enemy was wearing heavy legionary armor. He carried a two-handed spatha in one hand with ease; in his other hand laid a scutum. The former Praefectus Praetorio suspected he would face an enemy of this type, which is why he chose a lengthy hasta spear as his weapon to gain reach advantage. Well, that and the fact he was not a particularly good fighter, and spears were famously easy to handle. His lack of combat training forced him to wear light armor so he wouldn't tire as much. For additional protection, he brought a parma-type shield.\n- Do you confess your crimes? - Pudianus asked, stopping Cinastovicus from pondering about his disadvantages.\n- I confess nothing. - If he were to die, he may at least die with honor. - This whole fight is a farce! A clear sign they don't have legitimate evidence against me!\nHis enemy rushed toward him with fury. Cinastovicus focused on the defense, blocking with his shield and spear, sometimes counterattacking with a shy parry. It was all for nothing. Marius was faster and stronger than him. Sometimes, a mere block of the strongman was enough to make the Praetorian lose his balance. It didn't take long for Pudianus to hack through Cinastovicus's shield, rendering it useless. Now, he had to begin his offense, no matter how sloppy. During the flurry of strikes, he noticed obvious openings that his opponent didn't exploit.\n- He's toying with me - Christianus noted in his thoughts.\nDuring the clash of the blades, he managed to whisper something to Pudianus.\n- Finish it, sir. Spare me the shame.\n- Then admit you're guilty!\n- He wants to be sure he's fighting a criminal. - Cianstovicus thought to himself. - I would've been able to exploit that had I been allowed a moment with him before the fight.\nThe accused tried a few desperate attacks, but he was already getting tired, while his opponent seemed to be able to keep on fighting like this for a month.\nCinastovicus looked around; there was no way he could escape. He didn't even manage to scratch Pudianus. He wanted to go out with honor, but there was little honor in dying. What's worse, some in the audience started to demand that Pudianus crush Cinastovicus's head, and he feared that as time went on, the Dominator may become more and more eager to fulfill this particular request.\nWith no other option available, he shouted: I TRIED TO MURDER OUR EMPEROR!\nPudianus rushed towards him even more swiftly than before. Cinastovicus raised his spear in defense as a last gesture of defiance. The gladiator's attack cut through its shaft, striking the traitor through the torso.\nAfter that, Calisius declared Cinastovicus guilty, but Christianus could barely hear him as his world quickly faded into darkness."

calisia.139.desc: "To sneak off from the Imperial Palace was an art in and of itself. The constantly shifting schedules of the guards, multiple watch towers, and the staff always willing to rat him out made escaping the complex unnoticed a near-impossible task, but after having to spend most of his life in the palace's restrictive confines, Ignatius knew nearly every secret passage that would lead in and out without attracting too much unwanted attention. In truth, he could have walked out the front door pretty much whenever he desired, but the neverending game of cat and mouse was one of the few forms of entertainment that the life of the heir to the Imperial throne afforded. \n\n- Ugh, I'm getting way too old for this. - Ignatius mumbled as he dusted himself after emerging from what could best be described as a sewer. Switching out his courtly clothes for plebeian rags and messing up his hair just enough not to seem too pampered, he blended in among the populace, taking in the sights of the forum that his educators deemed too undignified and simplistic to let him watch. As he gazed at the tricks of some visiting troubadours, a weak, raspy voice interrupted him. \n\n- Young man, would you mind helping an old-timer with a little personal project of his? I swear it won't take long. I can even pay you some denarii if need be. \n\nIgnoring both his responsibilities and the potential dangers of the situation, Princeps Ignatius followed the senior to his modest, rustically furnished tenementum. Once the kettle clicked, the two conversed over a cup of over-brewed tea. \n\n- I'm thankful for the invitation, but what is it that you need my help with, sir? \n\n- Like I said; a personal project. I was a woodworker back in my day, you see. Artisan crafts, and all that. It's been a while since I picked up the old chisel, not that I'd be able to do anything with it with my hands trembling like mad. But you, you could be my vessel. I'll tell you everything there is to do. Just follow my lead. \n\n- And what exactly would we be creating? - the Princeps asked naively. \n\n- Oh, right. Guess I forgot to tell you. The Emperor will be visiting the district soon. I know it's a long shot, but I wanted to give him a statue of his noble figure. \n\n- Like... out of your own volition? And you aren't even getting paid for it? \n\n- Of course! - He proclaimed loudly. - I know that for Imperator Ricardus, it would be nothing but a curious little trinket, but it's the least I can do to show my gratitude. \n\n- Gratitude? I thought the plebeians... uhh, we hated the monarchy. Clamored for true democracy, true equality, an end to our unjust system where unelected autocrats waste... - he nearly broke into an impassioned speech, only to be interrupted by his interlocutor. \n\n- Let me tell you this, sonny. When you reach my age, you'll realize no liberty is worth more than a meal on your plate. And say what you will about Ricardus; he knows how to make sure his abundant leftovers trickle back down to the people. Now, enough chatter. Let's get to work."

calisia.142.t: "Shame Parade"
calisia.142.desc: "In the central arsenal of Calisia, the emptiness was palpable. Praefectus Provisionis Andreas Quercus was far from pleased by this fact. Especially since the grand military parade was to take place the following day on the streets of the Eternal City. Legions from across the country were sending their representative companies. But none of the Legates were generous enough to lend heavier military equipment for the parade. So, the prefect could only hope that the legionaries would at least bring their personal gear so he wouldn't have to scavenge for old gladii and scrap resembling lorica segmentata armor.\n\n- Marcus! What if we borrowed some chariots from the racing track? There's no hope for airplanes... but send people throughout the city to look for anyone with drones. If they fly high enough, no one will realize it's Sericum junk. And try to find any tracked vehicles in the city. Anything! - The prefect was frantically searching for any solutions that would allow him to conduct the parade without facing public ridicule. After all, Augustus himself would be there. If it looked more like a medieval peasant march instead of a mighty army, they'd throw him to the lions.\n\n- Sir Prefect Captain! - One of the young legionaries, who had been assigned to this duty as punishment, suddenly burst into the warehouse holding a scroll of parchment - I have good news!\n- They didn't teach you to salute in the legion?!\n- P-p-pardon, sir captain magistrate - stammered the legionary, making a hesitant hand gesture. Drill and proper titling of superiors were not his strong suits - I have news from Legio Alpha! They've just entered the city and are on their way here. They have a tank for us!\n- Ave Vinicius! Finally! Wait, what do you mean, a tank? As in, singular?\n- Do we even have more? They said a tank, not tanks.\n\nAn hour later, it turned out the message was accurate. When the representative company of the first legion headed to the barracks for rest, a single tank with its crew made its way to the arsenal hall. By post-Fall standards, it looked quite impressive. As impressive as a tank cobbled together from scrap can look. The legion's banner fluttered on the back of the tank, and the entire structure at least seemed to hold together. However, the closer it got to the prefect, the worse it appeared. The grating sound it made could frighten anyone, but probably most of all the crew. When they parked, Andreas approached the vehicle, somewhat mollified but wary.\n\n- Salve, soldiers. I see you've brought me something sensible at last - he said, slapping the tank's front plate with satisfaction so hard that a side plate fell off. The tank commander didn't seem overly concerned. Evidently, this happened more often than one would admit.\n- Don't worry, sir, this junk does that. It can be fixed - the commander said, trying to demonstrate the process by kicking the tank. The other side plate also fell off, the steel plates on the turret began to slide, and the banner on the back of the tank toppled over. Many thoughts now swirled in Andreas's mind. Many of them vulgar."

She could not believe it would persevere or mark her a citizen or even last a year. And according to everything she knew and calculated, the time all this was coming to a head was... now.\n\n- Well, the market's in an itsy bitsy little gully right now, everyone decided the housing market went crazy, and now it's time to cool down before we pick up steam again. Happens when renovation costs keep rising, right? - the realtor, who introduced himself as Thaddeaus, went on and on about how good the market is as if trying to talk her out of selling. He pointed at one mansion on the periphery of Calisia. - This one, for example, I think he's motivated to sell his house in exchange.\n\n - Why is he selling? - she asked.\n- He's not working right now. Weird guy. Doesn't even buy slaves.\n- So they're leaving, why? Inflation?\n- That villa over there, I sold for 3 mil. Four months later, four mil.\n- You sure it's the housing market and not a price increase?\n- Oh it's just a gully, that's all, just nerves.\n- How many people are selling,  then?\n- This place on the left, it's mine. I could sell, maybe, but that's just a summer home.\n- A summer home that looks like a junkie den.\n\nThe car stopped, and Thaddeaus walked out, clearly agitated. No one told Iulia her realtor held a hand cannon in the suitcase. He walked into the summer house. A few screams, more in common with meese than human beings. Two shots from the hand cannon. To Iulia, the sound was ear-shattering, even from the car. A few decrepit barbarians ran out through the windows, disregarding the multiple glass lacerations.\n\n- Fucking barbarians everywhere, like ants! Next time, I'm gonna shoot them like ants! Thaddeaus was fuming when he reentered the car, but Iulia was shuddering. - What's wrong? - she asked.\n\n- One of these 'barbarians'... I knew him from a tavern I frequented.

After the Fall, the one thing she had left was her husband and his lands. The early days of the Fall were dreary to face for a woman otherwise used to luxury. But within Calisia, over the years, Atia's husband worked his land and bought slaves to re-utilize more of it and restore their wealth.\n\nNow, Atia could vent her frustrations on the slaves. Feeling down due to Calisian women's legal status? Whip the least productive slave. Husband's being a dude and can't even notice basic clues like your eyelids lowering half a centimeter while sitting on a different lap than usual? A hunky slave was always obedient and observant. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned - and Atia was already there while on the precipice.\n\nThese days, however, it was worse than ever. - He always yaps about how prices go up and we need to spend less. How can he see a financial bubble without female intuition? - she'd gossip with fellow Calisian housewives in her dining room, sipping on the last reserves in her wine cellar.\n\n- Yeah, the eggs at the market have doubled in price already relative to last month. Some unrest in the capital, but this is pretty much the usual in this cursed land. No one sees a bubble. That's what makes it a bubble.\n\n- I take it no one can see that our imports are in the gutter?\n\n- Shush, do you know how dangerous saying that is? We should cut down on the wine. We have a shortage as it is.\n\nAtia wasn't even all that concerned. Their estate sold wheat and even eggs, and rising prices meant more money for them! But still, the husband wanted them to save. Yesterday, she spent the whole day looking for ways to cut costs. Ultimately, she figured out the slaves could mash meat with hay and eat the resulting kibble. She also cracked open the dog food she had left after her old German Shepherd, Titus, passed away. The slaves were beneath Titus anyway.\n\nToday, she argued on and on with her friends about what was even going on around them. Soon, they left. Normally, they'd yap on and on till midnight, but this time, they had to leave before dusk as the streets weren't safe at night. Sometime later, while sitting on the couch and resting, she heard some commotion, pottery breaking, and her husband's furious yelling. The patriarch barged in with a bloodied knife.\n\n- What the fuck is going on out there? The slaves just made their escape!\n\n -WHAT?! Why haven't the guards.... wait, we dismissed all the guards; they were asking too much!\n\n- Goddamit, you had one job... you didn't feed the slaves, did you?!\n\n - I... this is YOUR fault.

She has needs and doesn't need a pauper.\n\nNevermind, there's not a single rich male in this entire cursed province at the moment. The only one who came close approached a working girl in Atia's sight:\n\n- Are you available?\n- No, I work like a carriage here.\n- I have a hundred thousand right here! - The vigil pointed at his briefcase.\n- Sorry boy, I'm a million denarii baby, and you know it.\n- Since when?\n- Since now.\n\nA million denarii girl. Atia didn't even have that much, not that it'd even buy her anything. But that wasn't the problem. Somehow, between all the dirt, roaming the dangerous streets like a ghost, someone screaming bloody murder every other minute, the one thing that hurt the most is that she had less net worth than a prostitute...\n\nA PROSTITUTE! SCARCELY ABOVE A SLAVE! WHOSE PLACE WAS TO BE SUBDUED BY BOTH HER CLIENT AND HER PIMP! - She screamed to herself but soon quieted down. Some guy was yelling at a howling woman. Atia snuck up to the insula where it happened and peeked through the window. A working girl was getting slapped by a man behind the window. Must have been her owner. He then sent her on her way, adjusted his jewelry, almost caught Atia as he turned around, and followed the working girl.\n\nAtia wasn't bothered by the girl's plight: She was in a state of mind where only she counted. And so, she carefully opened the broken window and snuck into the office. It was time to rob and steal, to soothe the ego, to survive. Before she could pinch anything, the pimp returned, and she had to hide behind the desk, her most valuable possession in hand: A dagger. When the pimp walked by the desk and spotted her, he shuddered and jumped up.\n\nBefore anything else could even be thought of, Atia jumped on him.\n\nShe fell on the pimp with a pugio to his neck and didn't hesitate. The sickening sound of steel rending flesh, a red fountain in Atia's face. She did not mind. Adrenaline guided her. Ripping the gold chains and taking the rings: Wait, that gold is fake as fuck. Never mind... his drawers. Papers. More papers. Condoms? Eek. And, jackpot! Diamonds, jewelry from real gold and silver, she could almost smell the authentic precious metals. And best of all, the real, honest-to-god... stacks of Scythian hryvnas? He must have been buying or selling girls from the Scythian underworld. Atia took everything of real value, escaped through the window before they could get there (they wouldn't for the next six hours), and ran. For the first time today, she was proud of herself. And deathly afraid. After all, she was now the richest person in the entire city. Next order of business: Escape this hellhole."

Soon enough, his hysteria turned out to be the reality as his homeland was engulfed in chaotic brotherly conflict, one he might have quite possibly not emerged out of alive. His mixed heritage allowed him to blend in passably enough not to be called out daily, so he was doubly surprised when he received the summons to participate in \"Basic Cultural Introduction Training.\" \n\nSitting at their desks in the damp basement of some underfunded school on the outskirts of the city, the \"barbarians\" - Matthäus and a bunch of his captured, shackled compatriots waited idly for their lecturer.

If you get a few more, you can redeem them during the tour for one of the amazing prizes! Now, this is going to be a hard one. Does anybody have a clue what this could be? - once again, the barbarian raised his hand. \n- A toilet paper roll? Really? Who do you take us for? Absolute primitives? \nIgnoring his frenzied shouts, the lecturer continued: - Remarkable! You've even completed your advanced hygiene training!? And that one sure is a toughie!

One of them on the southeast corner had just begun:\n\n- Having rejected common humanity, the barbarians among us stop at nothing to defile us! Do not presume they are looking for their own self-preservation, no: They are doing all of this out of malice; their driver is pure fucking meanness! How many girls were trafficked by the Scythians?

They ravage our women and children; again, and again, and again, and again! They cover their eyes with soot like prostitutes!\n\nThe crowd started murmuring, and a few citizens roared in approval. He was doing well for himself, at least far better than the speaker on the other corner of the Forum.\n\n- Citizens, the only good barbarian is the one on his knees. The only language a barbarian understands is that of fear and force. Through the force of arms and the fear it elicits, we will tame even the worst of their kind! Only on their knees, only broken can they ever amount to anything. They're like bulls.

Despite the heavy downpour that turned the only road into the settlement into a barely traversable puddle of mud, rather than meet him with a threatening wall of pitchforks, each of the fifty or so remaining, poverty-stricken residents have taken time out of their day to greet Iulius with the finest collection of gifted local wares, each of similarly questionable quality. \n\nFor the last decade, Crerovia had been on a warpath, coveting the unprecedented, unearned wealth of the sole influential landholder in the area, holed up in his generational estate. Every attempt to forcefully seize it by the peasants had failed until eventually, the village regressed into a state of defeatist acceptance of their miserable fate. Today, Iulius would be their savior. Today, they would finally live like kings. \n\nAs the heavy rain gave way to an ominous storm, the peasants of Crerovia, along with their chained and screaming nemesis, gathered on a tiny hilltop, dwarfed by the massive pile of denarii, awaiting their share of the spoils with bated breath. And thus it began: \n\n- The first denarius goes to Sergius - the hunched villager approached, graciously taking the shining coin. \n- This one will go to Silvia - the aging eldress came forth, held up by two of her descendants. She picked up the denarius with her unusually pale hand before collapsing face-first into the dirt as flies swarmed what remained of her body. \n- Fine, the coin shall go to Elisea instead. Come receive what is rightfully yours. - A silence followed. - Umm, Elisea? Is there anybody here named Elisea? No? Hmm, guess I'll store it for safekeeping then. Now, I invite Mauritius to... \n\nWith a swarm of cheers and boos, the distribution process continued as the day turned to night and night turned to day once more. As Iulius continued with an increasingly tired voice, it seemed little headway had been made into the pile itself. \n\n- Sergius, and this coin is for you, your third of the day. It seems Crassus has blessed you on this fine evening. - the man approached and claimed his prize, as jubilant as ever. \n- And that concludes our fair and equal redistribution of your village's wealth. I hope everybody is satisfied because we sure knocked that oligarch down a peg! \n- Umm, Mr. Quaestor... - a weak figure asked. - What about the rest of the money? \n- Hmm, that? It's my fee for helping you guys out. It's only fair since I had to be on the clock for that entire time. My associate will be here soon to pick everything up. \n\nSeeing the rising anger of the villagers, Iulius hurriedly got on his horse, beyond the reach of their pitchforks. \n\n- Oh, and Sergius has more denarii than the rest of you now, so you might want to figure that out. Valete!"

calisia.149.t: "Nemo Supra Legem Est"
calisia.149.desc: "Another day, another list. Pursuing financial crimes and tax evaders wasn't the dream assignment for any of the Vigiles, but to a poor cook's son like Iulianus, it was the only opportunity to experience a modicum of deserved comeuppance. Besides, the commission he got for each capture was nothing to scoff at. As long as it paid the bills, he'd be fine locking up the Emperor himself. Usually, it was some miserly merchant who thought he could earn a few extra bucks by cooking the books. However, he did sometimes wonder why he never got to bust anybody with actual wealth and connections. Perhaps they didn't trust him enough to handle the serious offenders? Well, looking at today's list, it really didn't seem like that was going to change anytime soon. It looked... unusually petty. He took a quick glance at the names: \n\n- Olivia Morosovica / 2 denarii 50 sesterces \n- Carolus Morosovicus / 4 denarii 99 sesterces \n- Sophia Novica / 1 denarius 99 sesterces \n- ... \n\nTens of names, none with a discrepancy large enough to buy a large pack of chips. And all with the local primary school as the main point of contact. Have the teachers been stealing stationery from their employers? Pitiable, but he did have to curb their excesses nonetheless. \n\nAs Iulianus' work hours didn't afford him the possibility to arrive after classes had ended for the day, he stepped into the school's empty halls and banged on the first available door. Interrupting in the middle of a basic spelling lesson, the officer turned towards the teacher, asking: \n- Uhh, did I find Mrs. Morosovica? Olivia Morosovica? \nA girl, barely older than eight, raised her hand. She answered gleefully. \n- I'm Olivia, Sir. Did I do something wrong? \n- You? But that's... So that means Carolus is... \n- My brother! - Her innocent smile turned to a visible frown. - Is he in trouble, Mr. Officer? \n\nStarting to sense the emerging pattern, Iulianus grabbed the class attendance sheet off the teacher's desk and began comparing it to the list of delinquents he was supposed to punish. A perfect match. His heart sank at the thought of what those soulless beasts over at the forum might do to the little rascals as retribution. He wished he could quit on the spot, but somebody else would instantly fill his position. Somebody who may not be so gentle. Alas, as difficult as it may be, a job is a job. Disgusted with himself, the officer completed his orders as always. \n\n- Alright kids, pack up and grab your wallets. Don't tell your parents, but we're going on a little trip to see the Forum Calisianum. Who's excited?"

calisia.150.t: "Bureaucracies of Scale"
calisia.150.desc: "Lit up only by Luna's faint glow and the dim flicker of a single lightbulb, strewn over the four corners of a specially ordered office table, laid the finest map of the Calisian Empire - the magnum opus of more than a dozen handsomely-paid cartographers. Markings dotted every single centimeter of the parchment, displaying a crowded web of population centers, from the mightiest metropoleis to the most remote villages, barely even touched by a quaestor's firm hand, each of them adorned with a small note listing the major issues highlighted by the local provincial governor. On the sides, piles of unopened letters marked the contours, likely complaints and suggestions from some powerless officials deep down the administrative chain. Dozens of peering eyes crowded around the map, drowning out the room's ambient noise with vigorous chatter, with each of the unassuming attendees, bureaucratic apparatchiks whose painfully average visages could barely be ennobled by the finest grabs hanging onto their meek figures, taking turns loudly proclaiming the supposed virtues of his own vision and diminishing that of the previous speaker with equal vigor, undoubtedly taking satisfaction at the unearned sense of superiority it afforded. \n\nIt is no surprise that this atmosphere of a glorified kennel would hardly prove to be conducive to any consensus. With the paltry funds the Emperor managed to set aside from his bleeding budget, all the administrators could do was essentially fight for scraps. \n\n- And furthermore, I find it of critical importance that we fund the expansion of grain production around Alba Pomeraniae. An increase of... \n- Oh, you do, Philipus? You mean the same industry nearly monopolized by your brother? Why not just give him a handout while we're at it, huh? \n- You're one to talk, Andrius! No, no, let's go back to your proposal for a second. Now tell me, who would get the contract to build that new district in Sedinum you suggested? Do they happen to share your last name by any chance? \n- Umm, hate to interrupt, but the municipium of Suebodinum requested clean drinking water. Surely we could... \n- No. Are we in agreement? Good. Now, back to the real issues. I am confident that a row of villas in Septembrum would entice wealthier citizens to settle and drive up local commerce... \n- Martinus, if you suggest villas one more time, I swear I will gut you with my own bare hands! \n\nA tense silence hung in the air following the threats. It had been the third time knives were drawn during the meeting, and even for the bureaucrats' inflated egos, it was getting too much. Eventually, one of the senior officials spoke, one of the few people in the room commanding any sense of authority from his peers: \n- Oh damn it, just give everyone an aqueduct or something. Looks pretty, does the job... and, most importantly, it'll shut them up for the time being. Now get out of my sight, I've heard more than enough from all of you. \n\nOne by one, they shuffled out of the building, acting as if they had solved all of the Empire's issues."
calisia.150.a: "Well, that was a productive meeting."

calisia.151.t: "Bureaucratic Hydra"
calisia.151.desc: "Standing in lines had recently become one of Iulius's favorite pastimes. His petition to the local magistrate sent him to the office in the nearest city - Lubinum. There, after waiting for several hours, he learned that compensation claims were only handled by the commercial magistrate in Glogovia. But once there, he was told that there had been a mistake and he needed to go to one of the provincial offices, which was in Lugidunum. It was only there that he found out his application would not be considered due to missing documentation. Moreover, he lacked an established Calisian lineage, and all his explanations were insufficient for his compensation claim.\n\nHowever, a Calisian is a stubborn being, and Iulius Iaius did not intend to give up easily. He quickly bought a train ticket to the Urbs. He intended to venture into the belly of the bureaucratic behemoth, to tear what he was owed from the mouth of this abysmal chaotic monster, to defeat the powerful dragon of oppression, rise against the machine that stomped on his kind, to...\n- Please take a seat, your request is processed, you have been assigned the case number MMMDXCVII.\n- After napping through most of the cursed wait, Iulius was finally up in the queue. He entered the small office.\n\n- What does this one require? - Asked the clerk in a bored and indifferent voice.\n- I wanted to apply for compensation for the harm done by the Praetorians. They came to my farm and stole everything that was there, not even a single hen was left. The house is in ruins, the fields plowed up, I can't plant anything, and not to mention one of them drove off with my tractor shouting that he was an Ursus. I suspect they weren't sober. They threatened to kill my family if I did anything, but you must understand that such things cannot go unpunished?! I demand reparations and a public trial in this matter, and I won't leave until I get it.\nIulius's stern tone did not impress the clerk at all. She just pressed one of the buttons under her desk and continued reciting the memorized official regulations.\n- According to the new act on decentralized public service, act five, paragraph three, only the regional government can process such claims. Please go to your regional Praetorian office.\n- BUT THEY WILL KILL ME!\n- Your designated administrative unit is the Central Praetorian Commission in Budorgis. Have a nice day.\nAt this moment, two guards entered the office and threw Iulius out of the building. Deprived of any illusions, he decided to do something suicidal. He went to Budorgis. He nailed his manifesto to the door of the Praetorian office as a safeguard in case of his imminent and unexpected death. Then, he opened the gates of hell and went to meet Pluto. The official stance of the Praetorian office the next day unequivocally stated: Iulius Iaius - such a citizen never existed, and even if he did, he was not in Budorgis, and he certainly did not jump out of a window. Besides, he deserved it. His tractor caught fire, injuring one of the guards. And that - is already a crime."

calisia.152.desc: "Arrive at the office five minutes before opening time, register onto the payroll clock, brew the strongest coffee the old, overused machine allows, maybe even two while he's at it, then finally plop down at the desk with a noticeable sigh. The work of a bureaucrat is a thankless, monotonous one, and Dominicus often wished he'd be doing anything other than spending the best years of his life marking down every insignificant development in the Imperial Ledger. The routine was getting to his head, but he waved the thoughts aside and began to diligently sift through the massive pile of letters and reports stacked before him. \n\n> Marcus Visnovicus, 32, loan of 10000 denarii from the Central Bank - a quick note in the List of Debtors, and the paper was quickly tossed aside. \n> Paulus Copatus, 44, insurance claim after workplace injury - a scribble in yet another index and a sip of the coffee. Slightly too bitter, he'd have to ask his boss to replace the machine. \n> Ricardus Calisius, 81, found dead in the vicinity of the Imperial Palace... \n\nDominicus could hardly believe his eyes. He knew this day would eventually come, but why did it have to be so soon? Why did it have to be him? He felt guilty; as if he had just killed the Emperor by his own hand. But why did nobody report this? Was somebody trying to hide it? But then why break the news to some random clerk? Something had to be wrong, and he swore to get to the bottom of whatever conspiracy was brewing. His heart was racing, yet he did his best to compose himself and continue the day as if nothing had happened. If he were to investigate the matter, he could not afford to look suspicious. With trembling hands, he picked up the next report: \n\n> Ricardus Calisius, 28, has given birth to a daughter, Ricardus Calisius \n\nSomething had to be wrong. A plot? A misinformation campaign? He began to quickly look through the papers: \n\n> Ricardus Calisius, 7, has entered the XXII Elementary School \n> Ricardus Calisius, 38, divorced from his wife, Ricardus Calisius, 35 \n> Ricardus Calisius, 22... \n\nIt seemed nearly every report from the Barbarian District was the same. This had to be something major; something... far above his pay grade. Dominicus sighed, slumped back in his chair, and returned to diligently noting the life events of each of these new Ricarduses."

What's worse, it is said that many high-ranking Senators and officers of the Praetorian Guard, led by the Prefect himself, were behind this conspiracy! Certainly, the Emperor will now be much more vigilant, and he will undoubtedly have to reassess his priorities. The fate of the \"most loyal\" guardians of the Emperor hangs by a thread, and Marcus Vinicius himself has announced that he will watch over Ricardus even at night if necessary.

calisia.155.desc: "An unexpected rebellion has erupted in the Dabrovia Basin, led by the famed gladiator Lucas Lituanus, who stylizes himself as a new Spartacus. The insurrection, now titled by the media as the Servile War, has taken root due to the relentless terror and unfair treatment of slaves and the working class imposed by the Optimates faction.\n\nLituanus, a once-enslaved gladiator, has become a symbol of resistance against the oppressive rule. His strategic acumen and charismatic leadership have united a diverse coalition of slaves, peasants, and disenfranchised citizens. The revolt was sparked by a brutal crackdown on dissent and heavy-handed policies that left the populace desperate and destitute. Reports from the region indicate that Spartacist forces have swiftly gained control of key positions in the industrial region of the Dabrovia Basin, leveraging both their knowledge of the terrain and the widespread local support. The Optimates now face a formidable challenge as the rebellion threatens to spread beyond the basin.\n\nThe uprising underscores the growing discontent with the ruling elite's tyranny. As Spartacus rallies more supporters to his cause, the empire must confront this burgeoning threat or risk a full-scale civil war. The eyes of Calisia are now fixed on the Dabrovia Basin, awaiting the next move in this unfolding crisis."

calisia.156.desc: "Oh gods, what a fucking night. - Bohdanus Lasuca exclaimed. No one knew how he got here or if he was still supposed to be alive. But it did not matter. The fountains overflowing with wine filled the palace air with such intense vapor it took merely a deep breath to become inebriated. A train of dignitaries, prostitutes, and seemingly random people shuffled across the sticky floor, stumbling on the wasted symposiasts and singing in broken Latin: \"CONDUCTORE GRATIOSUS, NON VARSOVIAE INGLORIOSUS.\" Silvius Iacobinus floated on his lectus in the pool, trying to sail towards two concubines on the other side, using a kithara as a makeshift oar. \n- Not here, not here, you Marian reform leftover! - Hvedorcus shouted, pulling Caletus from the edge of the fountain by his scarlet-stained toga. - This is the wine fountain! \n- Silence, scum! I am a Senator, and no plebeian sandal-licker will tell me where I can piss or not! Ubi sum, ubi mingo! Ave Imperator Calisius! \n- Speaking of the Emperor, have you seen him? - Vinicius asked, indulging in another round of arm wrestling. \n- I have no idea... AARGH! - Answered his opponent, a certain Senator of little renown and even lesser muscle mass. - Last time I saw him, I thought he left to rest for a while with his concubines. \n\nSomething heavy has fallen into the fountain. - I told you, ciceronian monkey! May Bacchus curse you with millstones in your kidneys! \n- I don't like this. This is too good of an opportunity for a coup - remarked Compa. - Come with me. - He said, nodding at a sizeable slave (or a freeman? No one seemed to remember by now), holding up a massive, ostrich feather fan. \n- Oh, don't spoil the old man's fun. - The legionary sipped from his cup. - The only danger he could be in is that of impotence. \n- Better safe than sorry. What's the worst that could happen? \n - I'll tell you: he'll mistake you for a concubine! \nAs the Senators laughed, a ruckus could be heard at the main entrance. Suddenly, a line of guards marched in, and behind their heads, rising and falling as if floating on gentle waves, Calisius - somehow bearded - lounged with lamb leg in one hand and an amphora in the other. The crowd carrying him cheered and sang joyous songs in every language that could be found within Calisian borders. \n- My apologies, noble senators. - Calisius exclaimed. - But I couldn't leave my people hungry and thirsty for too long. I suspected I could go incognito, but it seems I am too recognizable! \n - I worried, o Imperator! - Compa approached the Emperor and spoke into his ear. - We have not reached a final agreement yet. Who knows what the Praetorians could be up to? Occasio furem facit. \nCalisius smiled softly. \n- The majority of them are drunk, and those here will be occupied with the crowd, while the crowd will be occupied with wine, food, and casual sex. Now, there is no one whose presence could... influence our negotiations from the outside. Andreas, please tell the servants to collect any Senator they can find. Soak them in a frigidarium, if necessary. We'll be meeting in the inner part of the palace. \n\nConsul Compa, somehow taken by surprise, only nodded briefly. As the crowd dispersed, scavenging for leftovers, Calisius stepped down and walked off, followed by bodyguards, and murmured to Vinicius."

calisia.159.desc: "Afternoon on a Friday. The golden glow of the Calisian sunset filtered in through a half-shut office window, not giving quite enough light to warrant turning on the lights but being just dim enough to make reading annoying. Most of the office had already gone home for the weekend, but not Marius. He was the unlucky soul who had to deal with the backlog of proposals for new Collegia left behind by the previous employee.\n\nHe tapped the eraser top of his pencil on the heavily aged wooden desk before him mindlessly as he read the proposal before him. A sewer diver collegium... He couldn't wrap his head around why something so specific would ever be required. He thought to himself:\n\n - How many sewer divers even are there in all of Calisia - ten or so? Wouldn't that fall under the jurisdiction of the Collegium of Plumbers?\n\n He furrowed his brow as he tried to write a reason for rejection that made any semblance of sense. Technically, the application was properly filled out, every \"i\" dotted, every \"t\" crossed... but it just didn't speak to him. Eventually, he settled on rejecting it on the grounds of \"overlapping with another collegium\".\n\nThat one simple piece of paper took him around 15 minutes to trudge through. Five minutes longer than the last one. Either he's slowing down, or these applications are getting to him... but wouldn't that just mean the same thing? With a jittery hand, he reached for his mug of coffee. Maybe he had a few too many today, but it didn't matter. He still had a neatly arranged pile of papers to go through.\n\nAnd so, Marius reached for the next paper with all the elegance of a drunkard by the local corner store, placing it squarely within his tired eyes' view. The \"Collegium for the admirers of Zenonas Iannicius\" was the first thing that caught his eye. A state-funded fan club? With an exasperated sigh, he grabbed his pen and wrote up a note of rejection on the grounds of not fitting within the criteria of a Collegium. That one was thankfully pretty simple, however, the next one... The \"Collegium for the fans of Zenonas Iannicius\" soured that fleeting feeling of contentment. With an exasperated sigh, Marius wrote a second letter of rejection, identical in every sense to the last.\n\nAs he reached for the next application, he felt a sinking feeling in his stomach. \"The Collegium for Philosophical Debate.\" He considered it for a moment. It sounded like a genuinely decent idea. Marius checked it in the database - no other Collegia similar to it have been established yet, the paperwork checked out... so it was approved. The third one today out of several dozens of applications. With just a few more minutes left in his shift, Marius took a sip of his long-cold coffee and picked up his last proposal for the day."

Go there yourself if you care so much. And bring me some sausage while you're at it! \n\nAfter thirty years together, Iustina still couldn't understand why she married that vulgar oaf. Still, a change of scenery and an opportunity to leave the house would do her nicely. Though her old bones creaked far too often that she'd like to admit, the brisk air and the rare peace of mind felt incredibly therapeutic. On the whole way through, she stared at the promotional poster for the campaign she held in her wrinkled hands. Tables stacked with mountains of restaurant-quality meals, spilling from all four corners at once and immediately refilled from the neverending horn of plenty upon removal, looking just as mouthwatering as before. She considered all the delicacies she never got to try on her measly budget, her appetite clamoring for something more refined than the usual cutlet, overdone potatoes, and perhaps even an occasional tomato soup on a particularly adventurous day. Even if just this one time, she would finally enjoy a hearty meal, and her husband would get none of it, just as he deserved. \n\nThough her patchy memory didn't allow Iustina to remember the exact address, the shouts she could hear from almost half a mile away certainly helped her navigate. The area looked run down, and even the neon sign welcoming the citizens in need barely flickered, yet it was nothing compared to the pandemonium inside. Shattered plates, torn wallpapers, people beating each other up for scraps using the legs of those aforementioned tables. Whatever real treasures were once in the warehouse have long been scalped by the lucky first arrivals. Or was there even any food in the first place? At this point, it was genuinely getting hard to tell. \n\nGoing on pure instinct alone, Iustina rushed right into the eye of the storm, hit a few unlucky folks over the head with her purse, and grabbed the nearest item she could find. Then, before anyone could spot that she held anything over 5 sesterces in value, she exited the area with the best half-jog her aching joints would allow. It was time to reveal her lucky find."

He hoped for an intelligent conversation but had to lower his expectations significantly to get anything out of the legionary he was questioning at the military camp on the Fields of Mars. Organizing such an interview wasn't easy; he first had to obtain three different permits, and in the end, an official from the Optimates faction closely monitored the entire conversation.\n\nHow would you describe the internal situation in the Legion?\n- You know, the boys are doing well, it's all good, but the problem is that basically, we don't have any more cash left, you know. HA! Last Tuesday, two homies had to figure out how to get their own armor because...\n- And honestly, the conditions our defenders have to endure are unacceptable! - Interrupted the Optimate official, interjecting into the conversation. - The state must provide additional funds so we can sleep safely without the fear of invasion, so we can have faith that these brave patriots will be ever vigilant about foreign and domestic threats.\nBOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM.\nThere was a rumbling sound that echoed throughout the square.\n\n- You have to pay for your equipment yourselves? - Darius tried to continue.\n- Riiight? I also think it's stupid. We should get more fundaments, or whatever it's called. Money. Dough. More scrilla for this aquila, you know?\n- So... you're saying it's a logistical issue?\n- No, no, to me, it's not logical. Listen - shiiit, I even saw some boys stealing chairs out of the barracks. Come on! Whaddaya need a damn chair for? They ain't even comfy.\nAnd the word became flesh. As if on cue, a chair crashed out of the window of one of the barracks. Shortly after, one of the legionaries flew out through the newly created hole. From inside the building, the pounding music was now clearly audible. Darius wondered what was causing the tremors, but now he knew it was the fault of DJ Bassus Maximus. The entire party was visible in the camera frame set up by the journalist in the square. The official, seeing this, immediately gestured to turn the camera away and continue as if nothing had happened.\n- Whoa, Hubertus got carried away with the Gallic libation, niiiiice. - The legionary seemed to be there in spirit with his comrades inside.\n- So, as you can see, the poor legionaries are even lacking windows in their barracks. How can they survive winter and have the strength to defend our country? - The Optimate clerk was still unbothered, and nothing would convince him to drop his stance on this matter."

As his cart tumbled through the dirt roads leading to the unremarkable village of Roscia, every building, field, and tree that remained from the pre-exile days brought back a surge of memories. Playing with the hens as his mother called him for supper, his father letting him have a ride on the household tractor, and then, the bells; their chime summoning him for the weekly mass. It was this sound, this personal closeness he felt to his God that led him to break the family tradition and pursue a religious career. In those early years, everything felt so simple. He cared not for the people's overwhelming respect, but seeing the pews fill up in quiet reverence during each of his sermons warmed the heart of the young cleric. Then, the flock began to dwindle like the hairs on his scalp. Where did it all go wrong, he often wondered. \n\nAs he neared the church he called home, the faint odor of spirits and vomit brought Father Vladislaus back to reality. With each step, the assault on his nostrils worsened, sullying the return. The entire perimeter, what was left of the parish's modest garden, was covered in empty bottles of cheap spirits, wine carafes, and... he dared not look further, for he felt even the sight of some of the depraved items left behind by the area's previous occupants would be enough to corrupt his soul. Against his better judgment, he continued onward, reaching the church's wooden doors, barely hanging in their frames and with the inscription \"PROPARTY OF DA BACCHANTS\" carved across the whole length next to a frankly impressive collection of obscene drawings. He pushed through, entering the spiritual sanctum, turned into a den of ultimate degeneracy by this impure sect. With resignation, he got about to clearing the most salvageable of the corners, if so could be said about any of them. Bottles, more bottles, ugh, he hoped to never learn what the unknown substance now coating his fingers could possibly be. And is that... no, damn it, is there a dead body lying forgotten on the floor? \n\nFearing the worst, Father Vladislaus gave the cadaver's torso a slight poke. Lost in the panic thought of just how exactly he was going to report the death to imperial authorities, the priest failed to notice the corpse seemingly regaining its vital forces. \n\n- Oi, gov'na! Fetch me some wine, will ya? Been dyin' of thirst over here. \n- Oh, shoo off, you drunk. - The cleric found himself utterly repulsed by the personification of sin before him. - Come back once you've sobered up, and I'll help you find your way back to the light. \n- Drunk? I'll have you know, you skirt-wearing pansy, that I'm a repa... repra... representative of the largest Church with the Empire.

With force. And you. - He pointed at the mother. - You have to hold her as hard as you can. You can't let your daughter go. Go ahead! \n\nThe groom spent a while standing in confusion, and then, he pulled on both arms of his future wife. The older woman could barely stand still, continuing to grab onto her daughter. \n- Ianus, why are you just standing around like that? Help me! - She called her husband. A rotund man stood behind her and grabbed them both with his bulky, soft-yet-strong arms. \n - Ay, sonny, you gotta pull harder. - The father of the groom exclaimed. - If I'd pulled like that, you'd not been born! \n- Stephanus, shut up and go help him! - his wife snapped. The father shrugged and pulled on his son. \n\nAfter a while, both of the families were wrestling on the floor, with the newlyweds somewhere in the middle. The Pontifex stood in the corner, looking upon the show and giggling."

calisia.164.t: "Forum Battle No.1"
calisia.164.desc: "As the warm sun baked the open platform of the Forum Calisianum, Vel Alexandros was finally given a moment to collect his thoughts. Maybe wetten his throat a little. He could not handle the sheer audacity of his opponent, Senator Micus. To call dirty foreigners and barbarians \"potential citizens\"? No, he could not stand for it. He would not allow it. And so, as the cheap drums started to play again some minutes later, he stood up eagerly. At that moment, he didn't see himself as different from his friends in the legions, bravely protecting every value that is Calisian.\n\n- Behold, my people, as swine opens our doors. \nA traitor, a snake that weakens our cause.\nTrue Calisians, you're my blood, not just deed.\nSo let's cut to the core of our nation's creed.\n\nFrom Polonia's fall, a lesson we glean.\nNot all are fit for the great Calisian scene.\nOnly the chosen, those who strive and toil,\nCan truly merge with our sacred soil.\n\nNot every seed in our garden grows,\nWhat plants can thrive only the gardener knows.\nCarefully chosen are the stocks that blend,\nOnly for the worthy does our fabric extend.\n\nThe confident smile, so iconic to Micus's image, didn't fade as she listened. Some of the crowd attendants cheered for sure, but most just started to murmur. He had him right in his grasp. The only thing to do - he thought - is to step up and reach...\n\n- A Senator, a coward, chosen by thee.\nHow loud and ignorant can he truly be?\nFor Calisia's strength and her mighty power,\nLies not in blood, but in every hour.\n\nEvery tax-payer, every hand that builds,\nIt's every heart that our culture fills.\nAll can be Calisian, true and bright as dawn,\nFrom the highest lord to the humblest pawn.\n\nWhy fear the poor, the willing, and the able?\nIs our Empire built on some kind of stable?\nCalisians are people, not stock that you breed.\nAnd so in that truth, we shall now be freed!"

calisia.169.t: "XVI - Reversed"
calisia.169.desc: "The show was spectacular, maybe more so than Cinastovicus ever imagined it would be, for what was supposed to be a means to get out of any potential crosshairs ended in him walking side by side with the Emperor himself, escorted by two of his, their, Guardsmen. Calisius wished to have a private conversation with Christianus, and how could his loyal servant ever refuse such a call?\n\nSoon, they arrived at the door to the palace's meeting room. An opulent chamber, much like all the rest, adorned by a grand table set with many more seats than were ever necessary, vibrant, well-tended plant life, and bookshelves of tomes written by esteemed Calisian authors. The accompanying Guards went to follow them in, however, with a swift motion of the Emperor's hand, they stopped.\n\n- That won't be necessary. Please wait for us outside. We won't be too long.\n\nWith a quick nod and a shuffle of their armor, the Guardsmen stepped out, closing the door behind them. Loyal to a tee, well trained and behaved, he thought. Cinastovicus wasn't especially impressed by the man before him. An aging, chubby man in laurels. Not the prime example of a strong ruler, but one he had to put a smile on for regardless. \n\n- Tell me, Christianus. What kind of wine do you like the best? - Calisius spoke out while walking towards the meeting room's much-coveted wine cooler. He spoke as if he was talking to a lifelong friend, a tone not very often heard coming from the Emperor, as the ruler is most often heard during grand, historical speeches or drunken arguments.\n\n- Anything that doesn't taste like mouthwash or grape tincture. - The First Praetor said, almost on instinct. Of course, he had his preferences, as every self-respecting citizen does, but they weren't the topic of discussion at hand, or at least he hoped so. He felt as if his answer didn't even matter as the Emperor turned to him with two wine glasses, each filled almost to the brim with a wonderfully deep red liquid.\n\n- How humble of you, Christianus. Here, drink. It's Latium. - The Emperor could barely keep a smile off his face as Cinastovicus accepted the wine. Soon after, he continued. - Christianus, do you remember the first days of Calisia? Back then, it was only a little city, just as Rome had once been. You have been there since the first days of its inception. I believe you've been indispensable then and especially now. I wanted to thank you personally for the show of loyalty. Let us drink. To Calisia, ever eternal! - The Praetor smiled as he raised his glass, not for the reason of being complimented, however. No, he didn't care much for that anymore. With a glass of imitation Latium, Calisius had sealed his fate. The words spoken by him made it clear to Cinastovicus that the Auroch had lost its horns. The thought of an Emperor getting sappy with his subordinates at the smallest positive gesture made his skin crawl. He was no longer the man who had forged the Res Publica; he now was just an old coot with more power than he could even think to use. \n\nThough, with those thoughts swirling around in the back of his head, Christianus responded without any hesitation:"

calisia.2137.t: "Aposthasis"
calisia.2137.desc: "- The pizza is here, my Emperor. \n- Please come in and place it on the round table in the corner. \n\nThe skies were dark, but calm. Gray clouds spread across the sky, blocking out the sun, yet it was bright enough that Calisius could work at his desk with ease. He put aside a redacted decree and grabbed a notebook from his drawer - an attempt at memoirs, one that he wasn't too satisfied with yet but pleasant to work on nonetheless. \n\nSteps. A man walking heavily. Then another. Calisius lifted his head and saw three Praetorian officers extending their hands in greeting, which was somewhat reserved. \n- Ave, Caesar. There are riots in the city. The palace is besieged. We'll have to move you inside. \n- Who sent you? \n- We're your guard, my emperor. I am optio Iulius Galienus of the Praetorians.  You have to be safe. Please come with us, we don't have much time. \n- I don't see such a need. I am safe here. You're dismissed. \n\nThe men did not move. Calisius opened up his memoirs and contemplated for a while, fiddling with his pen. \n- If you're thinking about taking me by force, don't. Here - he reached into another drawer and produced a finely ornamented gladius, a gift from Marcus Vinicius himself. - Draw a blade through my heart and let me die like an emperor. \n\nThe Praetorians were astonished. Every one of them was handpicked by Cinastovicus as those who combined utter loyalty to their prefect with being recognized and trusted the most by Calisius. They did not even dream of killing their Emperor - unlike some of their colleagues. They were the ones who were meant to keep the emperor safe and under control, and if one of the conspiracy leaders actually wanted to get rid of the emperor, it would be likely he'd first have to get rid of them. \n\nThe gladius laid upon the desk like a terrifying omen. Iulius Galienus reached for it and lifted it just to put it as far from the emperor as possible. But he held it in his hand for a while, observing the fine craft of the silvery blade and its ornaments. \n\nAnd, as a faint beam of sunlight shone through the clouds and reflected on the blade, Calisius realized that now all of it would come to an end. Not only will his identity as Calisius perish. So, too, will Ryszard Kalisz die, and only dust will remain. He bargained for a split second. Could the game end with this? Yes, for it is not a game. Not anymore. Just like he's not an emperor anymore. Just a man who fumbled around until getting stuck at the edge of a precipice. \n\nWith astonishing and unexpected speed, Calisius lunged towards the window and jumped through it. He managed to get one foot on the ledge beneath but struggled with the other one. The Praetorians rushed in, grabbing the emperor by his toga. He struggled, trying to get rid of his clothes. One of the soldiers grabbed him by the foot. In a bout of strength, Calisius managed to pull his leg back but lost his balance. His other foot slipped from the ledge, and as Iulius Galienus pulled harder, the purple cloth ripped, and Calisius fell, half-naked, with his eyes in disbelief as to what was happening. \n\nThere was no loud sound nor gruesome view. Ricardus Calisius lay flat on his back, unconscious, and a tiny stream of blood flew from his mouth onto the soil of Calisia."

calisia.170.t: "Old Habits Don't Die"
calisia.170.desc: "Phaon... Not really the name he would've handpicked for himself had he more time to choose, but it worked well enough and was probably more recognizable. A stroke of luck and meeting Deląg, well, Vinicius, netted him a pretty comfortable position in Calisia's structures. He reminisced on some of those days. They went by in a flash, meeting Cinastovicus, joining the Praetorian Guard... he served his post so well that it earned him the title of Gubernator. He stared off into space, vaguely looking towards the Emperor's portrait on the wall of his admittedly cushy office, even somewhat enjoying the moment of peace and quiet. That was until it was interrupted by a knock on his door, snapping him out of his trip down memory lane. It swung open to reveal a mountain of a man, one of the Gubernator's closest friends and now his second in command - Martinus Ossadovicus.\n\n- Hey, letter for you, from the Prefect himself. Came in the mail today, along with all the other usual junk. Here.\n\nPhaon grabbed the letter and opened it with a bayonet knife resting on his desk. It started off pretty nice, all the formalities included, but then it all went downhill, starting with the words: \"I regret to inform you that despite your outstanding work, your rank within the Praetorian Guard will be degraded.\" Something started boiling beneath the surface of his demeanor. He could barely contain himself as he burst out.\n\n- Who does this pissant think he is!? Who does he think I am! I loyally serve the Emperor day in, day out, and this is the thanks I get? Corruption within my region? Is he fucking sick in the head?\n\nMartinus walked up cautiously and skimmed over the letter. He tried to come up with anything to calm him down and not do something comically rash.\n\n- Well, maybe this wasn't addressed to you? You know the rumors about the other Gubernatores. \n\n- Oh, to who then? Tell me, to Naimanus, that gilded motherfucker? You know he's Cinastovicus' little pupil. No harm could ever come to his sorry ass. Especially not for \"Corruption in his ranks.\"\n\nPhaon stood up from his desk, poring over the letter in his hands. It took all the effort in the world for him not to rip to pieces. He turned to the window and smacked the half-crumpled paper on the windowsill. He was doing his absolute best not to start yelling more remarks at Cinastovicus and every one of his underlings. He knew damn well that the charges were falsified, but he had no idea why. Martinus chimed in from behind him."

calisia.171.t: "Speak No Evil" 
calisia.171.desc: "First, he was fingerprinted, then was asked to come in for some questioning about the recent theft and now he was the prime suspect in the investigation, all for working storage.\n\nThe evidence mounted against him was overwhelming. CCTV footage of someone who looked just like him skulking around the facility at night, his own fingerprints plastered all over the scene, and his wife's uncertainty of whether Stefanos was home that night. To an outsider, it would seem like an open-and-shut case. He was caught nearly red-handed, carrying out a heist so sloppy and amateurish that it was almost comical. At least it would've been if not for the fact, he wasn't the one who was responsible.\n\nHis stomach was starting to growl. It had now been five, maybe six hours of sitting in the interrogation room of the Praetorian Guard's Calisia headquarters, backed into a corner and paralyzed by the stare of two senior Guardsmen. He had never felt more guilty in his entire life than he had right now, and he was nowhere near close to being guilty, or even being complicit in any way.\n\nThe hum-buzz of the lamp above him seemed like a deafening roar and bored deep into his skull, slowly picking away at his psyche. As he shuffled around in his almost purposefully uncomfortable chair, the older of the Guardsmen spoke up, his voice course like sandpaper on Stefanos' ears.\n\n- Mr. Stefanos, we really do not want a lot from you. All that we're asking is that you tell us where the Greek Fire was hidden. We're willing to bargain for you to be given a shorter sentence if you help us.\n\nThe Praetorian had the most infuriating expression on his face. It showed some degree of smugness like they knew he wasn't really the one responsible, but they still tried to do him in. He felt like he was being mocked, like this was all some twisted joke. Despite wanting to yell all kinds of obscenities at his interrogator, Stefanos sighed and repeated what was by now becoming his mantra.\n\n- Like I said already, Mr. Savicus, I do not know where the Greek Fire is, because I did not steal it. You have the wrong guy! The reason my fingerprints were on the scene, is because I was the one handling storage! How can you not understand-\n\nAs his tone started rising, he was quickly shut down by a vicious glare from the other Praetorian. While his interrogator was highly experienced and trained in establishing rapport, the other was not much more than a jailor, more than happy to put him in his place. As Stefanos wound down, the interrogator interjected again, with a degree of anger, that he hadn't heard him speak until now.\n\n- Mr. Stefanos, this kind of behavior will not be tolerated again. This is your last chance to confess, otherwise, we will take you back to your cell.\n\nStefanos wanted to argue more. He could've gone on for hours, days, weeks if given the chance, but this was all too much. What was the point of this? He could argue for another hour, or he could spend five years less in prison, maybe even fewer with good behavior. Despite every part of his body being in protest, he nodded and spoke.\n\n- I- You're right, Mr. Savicus... I was the one who stole the Greek Fire.\n\nThe Praetorian smiled, clearly satisfied with his compliance. He ordered Stefanos to stand up, turn around, and face the wall. However, as Stefanos was being cuffed and taken out of the room he realized one small detail. Just how did they know that his fingerprints were on the crate of Greek Fire if they supposedly hadn't found it yet?"

Now, he regretted he ungagged the captured Consul.\n- Failed actor! - Caletus brought up Vinicius's past.\n- Cinastovicus's lapdog! - Vinicius hit back.\n- Siphilius Maximus!\n - Toga-wearing chav!\nHad the prefect of the Praetorians been in the place of Caletus, he would've likely already been hit with a gladius's grip. But due to Caletus's proficiency with foul language, Vinicius couldn't help but respond. He saw a worthy opponent in his prisoner when it came to the discipline of insults. Facing him in this way was a question of honor, one could say.\n - I must've really gotten under your skin. - Caletus decided to deliver a more complex insult. - Given the fact you rushed to defeat me, instead of Cinastovicus. His capital was practically under your nose!\nThe legate didn't respond.\n- Not to mention it was his Praetorians who were responsible for the death of your lover boy Calisius. - The Consul exploited the opening he saw. - I just was glad the tyrant was gone.\n- Securing the Urbs strengthened my legitimacy. - The Legate retorted. - Even a half-wit such as you must see that.\n- Then you're not the honorable warrior your propaganda led the plebs to believe but another slimy politician, serving the cause that harms the people of Calisia! A barbarian-lover that sullied my name by untruthfully claiming I had something to do with the demise of the Emperor. - Caletus looked his captor hatefully in the eyes and spat. - There's no honor in you! Untie me, and I'll punch you to death, proving you're also not a warrior.\n- Those so-called barbarians are not as brutish as you are. - Marcus decided to finally end this game, - You've wasted enough of my time. I don't need to prove my prowess by beating an Optimate hog. And when it comes to my honor, - Vinicus paused. - You will be given the possibility to leave this world in a dignified way by committing suicide of your own volition. Even that's too much for you.

### SPRAWY GNIEŹNIEŃSKO-KALISYJSKIE ###

gniezno_szlachta.6.t: "Rotary Alliance"
gniezno_szlachta.6.desc: "Report after report... Those were today's plans for the glorious Emperor. Ever since the lands across the Prosna were conquered by his legionaries, the amount of paperwork he had to spend his highly dignified time on had more than quadrupled. What was once a mildly annoying fact of life between breakfast and lunch had now become the focal point of Ricardus' life. It almost felt like he was a lawyer again... \n\nSitting on his throne, or a rather highly decorative armchair handmade for him by a local artisan, he read and read. All the ministries' and institutions' reports were just a bland mess by now. He propped his head up with one hand, and, with lazy eyes, he glanced over at the door to his throne room, where he saw one of his palace stewards. Trying not to appear startled, he looked at the clock to see if he missed an appointment before clearing his throat and speaking.\n\n - Oh! My apologies. I didn't hear you come in. What is it that you require?\n\nThe servant scratched his head, not entirely sure how to begin, but he soon said:\n\n - There is a visitor, my Emperor. He says he is an envoy from the northern Aldermanship. He claims to carry a message of grave importance.\n\n - A messenger from Rota? Very well, allow him to enter.\n\nWith a quick motion, the servant leaned his head out the door and gestured for the envoy to enter, exchanging a few words in what the Emperor could've sworn sounded like Polish. Then, to his surprise, a man dressed in a żupan and a kontusz, topped with a highly decorated hat which he threw off his head as he fell to his knees before the Emperor's imposing magnitude. Before Calisius could shake his shock or even formulate a question, the delegate spoke.\n\n - Emperor Ryszardus Kaliszjus the First! I come before you in a time of true need. The tyrant, Przemysł the Third of Gniezno, threatens the liberty and safety of the Aldermanship of Koło. Alderman Kazimierz himself offers to swear fealty to your Imperial Highness in exchange for protection against the encroaching despot!\n\nThe Emperor set aside his papers and considered the request. Rota, or Koło as they call it, is entirely at the Res Publica's, or rather his mercy. The Alderman is weak; there's no denying that. Subjugating his statelet would be Calisia's easiest conquest. However, who's to say that a once disloyal subject wouldn't just turn to another overlord if their lands are encroached upon? After a few minutes of thorough deliberation, the Emperor gave his verdict to the desperate delegate."

Or worse: What if the common enemy turns out to be a wuss?\nThose questions dwelled in Alderman Kazimierz Ilski's head as he contemplated his 'success.' He sought Calisia's protection from Gniezno's increasing ambition. He hoped Duke Przemysł would attack him for his treason. Then, he could prove himself as a military leader and buy himself some time. Well, it turned out the discount Piast no longer wanted to be Kazimierz I and decided to act like Stanisław II Augustus instead. That enabled Calisius to start the annexation process right away, culminating in this situation. Incoming total incorporation of Koło.\n\nLater that day, a Calisian delegation arrived, led by legate Adalbertus Solicovus - a military man who held no civilian office. A clear sign that Koło would be eviscerated by soldiers if Ilski tried to refuse the 'generous' offer of Calisius.\nThe whole ceremony had to take place at the center of the town to satisfy Calisian hubris and the wiec traditions of the Koło people.\n- People of Rota! Amici! - Solicovus began - to further protect you from foreign invasions and the lawlessness of local officials, the wise Ricardus Calisius decided to bestow upon you the honor of becoming an integral part of his empire! Rejoice! Together, we will build a bright future and civilize the savage lands around us! Our best Legionaries will protect you from the barbarians! The most virtuous of you will be able to ascend to senatorial dignity, influencing the future of the whole empire! Not to mention lower prices on precious Calisian goods due to the abolishment of tolls! Fear not! We will not restrict your freedoms! All that remains is for Alderman Ilski to show his submission by kissing the golden aurochs of Calisia!\nA Vexillarius standing next to Solicovus unfurled the Calisian banner. Some in the crowd were appalled by this incoming humiliation. Seeing the hesitation of future Rotans, the legate continued his speech.\n- Remember, Calisius is not a tyrannical monarch like the one we saved you from! In Calisia, we applaud our wise neighbors for their republican traditions. Fear not! We will not strip you of your freedoms and rights! - The crowd calmed down upon hearing those words.\n - It would be foolish to oppose them. - Ilski thought to himself. He knew the history of Rome all too well. He also remembered the deal he was offered. He would keep his position as the governor of Koło. He and the members of his council would also be given the title of equites. Ilski himself was ensured that due to his rank and knowledge about the Roman Empire, his promotion to patrician and Senator could be hastened quite significantly should he so wish.\nRealising he had no other alternative, he leaned toward the scarlet of Calisia and kissed the standard.\nThe legionaries played trumpets, hoping to hide the fact only a few residents of Koło cheered."

post_calisia.1.t: "End of Eternity"
post_calisia.1.desc: "The worst has come to pass. Yet another pivotal moment in the history of civilization, following the Fall of Rome and the Fall of Constantinople. Calisia has fallen. The exact details of the city's final hours under siege remain unclear, but it is known that Ricardus Calisius was seen among the crowd, encouraging the defenders to fight. The Emperor vanished after that. The besieged capital withstood the onslaught of barbarian hordes for a considerable time. The final hope was the legions of the foederati under the command of Donaldus Tusc, who was supposed to relieve the encircled city.\n\nIt is known that the Germanic forces were indeed forced to retreat, and the city gates were opened to welcome the allied soldiers who had come to save the Eternal City. However, instead of a triumph for Calisia's forces, a massacre ensued. Those who were meant to be liberators from the barbarian yoke became the ultimate gravediggers of the Empire. The troops under Tusc's command completely ravaged the capital. The palace was seized, and within it, Calisius's children were taken captive and forced to pay homage to Tusc, who proclaimed himself King of the Veneti. The Senate, under coercion, confirmed Tusc's rule, making him the sole and undisputed ruler of the Empire - or rather, the Kingdom. However, his undisputed rule lasted only a few hours before news of the capital's fall spread to the furthest corners of the Empire, initiating the fragmentation of Calisia's power.\n\nPossessing the capital of a dying Empire may hold significant importance in the new world that will emerge from the ruins... but it may not be as great an advantage as it might seem."

post_calisia.2.desc: "The elevation of Tusc to the throne was a crucial moment for the hegemony of the barbarians over the neo-antique world of Calisia. Not only did it break the spirit of the remaining defenders of the Empire, but it also led to the most treacherous treaty since the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. The newly crowned King of the Veneti allotted each Germanic warlord their own parcel of land carved from the corpse of Calisia.\n\nIn the far north, the raiding Jutes received the estuary of the Viadrus River, along with the important metropolis of Sedinum, ensuring their dominance in this part of the Mare Balticum. From Veluntia to Coluberga, the coast of Pomerania Occidentalis was set ablaze and fell prey to Jutic invasions, not for the first time in history.\n\nThe Franks settled in the territories in Germania vacated by the Goths, as well as the lands across the river reaching the borders overlapping with the Terra Lebusana, with strongholds in Suebodinum, Landsbergum, and Piriseum, even though they did not move their seat from Francofortum. Now, they possess a city on both sides of the river, finally united.\n\nThe Saxons became one of the major hegemons in the region, as they not only settled in Lower Silesia, extending as far as Lugidunum and Prasia Elysiorum but also managed to reclaim the territories of Saxony, which were previously plunged into anarchy, further strengthening their position.\n\nThe Vandals and their offshoot, the Silingi, settled all of Silesia from Budorgis to Catovicia, and now the conglomerate of these two tribes jointly possesses one of the strongest economies remaining in this ruined world. Only time will tell if they can capitalize on this advantage."

post_calisia.3.desc: "The triumph of the Germanic tribes in the west was undeniable, as it was primarily their forces that conquered Calisia. However, a second great war was simultaneously unfolding on the eastern flank, marked by fewer but equally significant battles. It can be argued that the Eastern Front infamously etched its name in the annals of history as the site of the greatest devastation, where entire cities were razed, and the casualty rates in battles were enormous, often leaving only about 10% of the forces on either side alive.\n\nThe Aestii pillaged their way as far as the gates of the Mariaeburgum stronghold, conquering almost the entire Borussia region for themselves. Most of their recruits comprised the Russian population previously subjugated by Calisia, whose occupation was deemed exceedingly oppressive. Now, the tides had turned, and the Aestii confederation of tribes exacted their revenge.\n\nIn the far south, the Scythians ruled, proving to be the least oppressive of the three eastern powers. The previously strong Ukrainian population in Calisia's territories ensured that Lublinum, fortunately, did not share the fate of other cities burned by the invaders. The sparse population density also worked in favor of the local inhabitants. However, this did not mean the region was spared the ravages of war. The Scythians did sack and plunder, with cities such as Rubrumium and Zamoscia laid to waste.\n\nThe most dreadful harbinger of death and destruction was the bloodthirsty horde of Huns under the command of Khan Khonoon I. Podlachia suffered a fate worse than mere death, with war destruction reaching approximately 90% of urban structures. Albacliva now resembled a rubble-strewn wasteland, no longer recognizable as a city. The fleeing population could not escape the mounted troops led by the personification of Hades himself, the Khan. The number of people slaughtered surpassed any imaginable measure of human cruelty, and the lands traversed by the horde make Mars seem like a more habitable environment."

post_calisia.4.t: "Gothic Triumph"
post_calisia.4.desc: "As in the past, the Goths have once again become the subjugators of a great Empire. Their pact with Tusc allowed them to traverse the fields and plains of the Calisian Empire without restriction, ultimately leading them to the heart of the country, where they established their new barbarian kingdoms. Limiting their plundering to a minimum, it appears that the new rulers of these lands intend to stay for the long term, as their settlement efforts have commenced in full force.\n\nThe Ostrogoths found themselves in a privileged position, securely located between the Vistula and Notis rivers, with powerful fortresses under their control, such as Bidgostia, Thorunia, and Vladislavia. Despite an informal alliance with the new ruler in Calisia, there are rumors that the ambitions of the Ostrogothic King extend to the boundaries of the Eternal City, and it is possible that another war may soon erupt, this time between the barbarians themselves.\n\nThe Visigoths, on the other hand, moved along the Varta River, where they established their kingdom. Their borders stretch as far as the Montes Calvi range. However, their settlement efforts have encountered significant resistance from the local population, with the fiercest battles currently being fought over the metropolis of Navis, whose western part is occupied by the Goths and the eastern part by partisans belonging to militias identifying with the Kingdom of Judah."

post_calisia.5.t: "Heirs of Humanity"
post_calisia.5.desc: "One can kill a man, but one cannot kill an idea. Ricardus Calisius fell defending his beloved capital, the city was taken, and the structures of the Empire ceased to exist. But the people survived. And it was upon the shoulders of these survivors that the mission to secure the legacy of the Calisian Empire rested.\n\nBefore the siege of the capital, most of the treasury was, fortunately, evacuated to Constantia, where Governor Trascovicus generously took care of the remaining wealth of the fallen realm. This also provided him with a pretext to declare himself emperor, which he did without waiting for anyone else. Believing that he held the historical civilizational imperative in his hands and was compelled by circumstances to act, he proclaimed the Eastern Calisian Empire, promising that one day, Calisia would be reunited as one. This proved to be a masterstroke, as fleeing dignitaries chose Constantia as their only viable refuge.\n\nHowever, Trascovicus was not the only governor with similar ambitions. Acting on the basis of nomenclature, the Governor of Pomerania, Phaon Alnus, declared himself the heir to Calisia. Residing, fittingly, in Nova Calisia, he believed this to be the only correct model of succession. Calisia could only be succeeded by Calisia. Unfortunately, his eccentric style and tendency towards vulgar outbursts have caused him to be taken less seriously in the race for the legacy of the Empire.\n\nIn Antecarpathia, a coronation also took place, as one of the former leaders of the Populares and legate, Silvius Iacobinus, declared himself King of the Calisians. This is a distinct category from declaring oneself emperor and represents a considerable drop in prestige, but Silvius views himself as a people's ruler and his domain as the people rather than the metaphysical representation of the state. Regardless of Silvius's potential as a great philosopher-king, his propensity for alcohol abuse means he is also not taken particularly seriously.\n\nThe strongest claims to the throne of Calisia would naturally belong to the sons of Ricardus, especially his eldest son, Ignatius. After the fall of Calisia, he survived by swearing fealty to Donaldus Tusc and even managed to escape the city, only to find himself in further peril when he reached the city of Nissa, where the local garrison immediately crowned him Emperor upon his entry through the city gates. Unfortunately, Silesia became overrun by barbarians, and Nissa found itself surrounded on all sides. One brave city now holds the hordes of hell at its gates, but those gates are beginning to crumble, and our Emperor's future seems very dark and full of terrors."

post_calisia.6.t: "Legio Aeterna Victrix?"
post_calisia.6.desc: "The fate of the legions has always been a tragic one, and this was unfortunately true for most of Calisia's distinguished units that were sent to battle the barbarians. After the fall of the Empire, the legions that were not destroyed disbanded on their own. However, those who still desired to fight for lost ideals and a lost cause organized themselves into increasingly larger armed groups. Of the entire military machinery of the Empire, only two legions survived in a state of combat readiness and organizational structure.\n\nLegio I Alpha, a legendary unit composed of the most loyal and battle-hardened soldiers, endured a campaign that would rival even that of Alexander the Great. However, they paid for their experience with painful losses; in addition to many veterans, their eminent commander, Marcus Vinicius, also gave his life for the Empire. Currently, the legion has managed to retreat to the very edge of the Montes Carpathii, where they are regaining strength and gathering the remnants of other forces.\n\nIn Masuria, another legion survived - Legio XXXVII Fanatica, renowned for its battles against the Huns, whom they held at bay for a long time. However, after their defeat at the Battle of Acrimorum, fate seems to be turning against the legionaries. Despite heroically holding the Suvalca corridor under the emblem of the crucian carp, they are likely to be forced to retreat due to fighting on two fronts; otherwise, they face the threat of annihilation."

post_calisia.7.t: "Northern Opportunities"
post_calisia.7.desc: "Along the Vistula River to the Mare Balticum, vast quantities of various riches flowed during the era of Calisia, along with other export goods. These trade routes are now occupied by warlords who are either trying to save their businesses or simply seeking power, aiming to salvage whatever they can before another wave of barbarian invasions strikes.\n\nOne of the main treasures was amber, a specialty of the Aquilen company (alongside their oil investments). By utilizing the infrastructure in Plocensia and their extensive network of contacts, they have managed to preserve their influence in the region and are becoming pioneers in the renewed trade among the remnants of the Empire.\n\nThe primary beneficiary of this trade has become the Carthagdinian Empire. Emulating its namesake, it has taken control of the majority of coastal territories, effectively seizing the empire's maritime industry and entire fleet. A new power is emerging in the Pomeranian Tripolis, eager to dominate the entire region under its banner.\n\nHowever, to achieve this, they face a rather absurd obstacle. In Sluchovia, a mystical ceremony elevated a prophet to the status of a deity. Iaroslaus Ultimus has declared himself the Emperor of the Last Days, and the whole situation resembles a dangerous cult more than an ordinary warlord. Nevertheless, Iaroslaus intends to lead his followers into the ultimate battle against the forces of evil, after which he believes the apocalypse and the kingdom of God will ensue. At least, that is his conviction."

post_calisia.8.t: "Far over the Tatra Mountains"
post_calisia.8.desc: "The most tranquil territories were usually found in the mountain meadows, and this was largely the case during the conquest of the mountains by Calisia. There were no grand battles, spectacular events, or heroic duels. It was a simple case of \"Veni, vidi, vici,\" followed by silence. However, politics abhor a vacuum, and soon after Calisia burned, the local garrisons decided to act. To protect the mountain strongholds from devastation, they chose their own Emperor. The choice fell on the beloved Robert Makłowicz, who accepted the position but not the title. To add an oriental touch to the new entity, Makłowicz took on the protection of the Armenian population, which had been flocking to the region in recent years. Given his Armenian roots, he became their idol.\n\nThe chaos also provided an opportunity for the Czechs, who freed themselves from German influence, effectively throwing out Berlin's authority. With the collapse of Calisia, they took a further step and crossed borders that had remained unchanged since World War II. As a result, Tessin and Glacium once again became part of the Czech lands, and they also annexed the areas of Ricmondia and Leobschucium. It appears unlikely that they will return these territories this time."

post_calisia.9.t: "Sparta or Spartacus?"
post_calisia.9.desc: "The harsh conditions lead to a rather drastic upbringing; while a tough and severe environment may forge a strong warrior, they do so at the expense of weaker individuals. These weaker individuals often fell prey to the Empire's ruthless policies that permitted slavery. Indeed, slavery was one of the pillars of Calisia's economic prosperity. In the modern world, however, traditional slavery cannot meet societal needs in the long run, and enslaved groups quickly transform into organized factions, verging on becoming terrorist organizations.\n\nThe industrial lands of Dabrovia, Pinus, and Osviecimia were the epicenters of slave labor, where factories operated around the clock, and slaves perished from exhaustion akin to the worst concentration camps. It is no surprise that it was in these territories that the Spartacus Union arose. Drawing inspiration from both their ancient and German namesakes, they sought to dismantle Calisia's entire machinery of slavery. Now, as the Empire collapses under its own weight, Lucas Lituanus has vowed to liberate all the people, both from the yoke of post-imperial warlords and barbarian kings.\n\nSpartacus, Spartans. The northern neighbors of the Spartacus Union were quite similar in name but not in concept. Based on the sports club Sparta Lubliniec and the military units stationed in the city of Lobin, they founded an entirely new society aimed at reviving Spartan ideals. As expected, this state was not necessarily lenient towards its citizens and quickly became a target for the Spartacus revolutionaries. Will the unwavering spirit of popular liberation overcome the fanatical warriors who uphold the bloody ideals of ancient Greece?"
post_calisia.9.a: "Come and take it."

post_calisia.10.t: "Gaulician Disarray"
post_calisia.10.desc: "Gaulicia. It does not exactly have Gauls, although there are some. The Gaulician Confederation represents a crucial piece in the post-collapse puzzle of southeastern Calisia. While it draws more inspiration from Galicia than Gaul, under the leadership of Ricardus Gaulus, the confusion persists among its citizens. Despite the bewildering nomenclature, the confederation, among the three newest factions, seems to offer a decent place to live, free from oppression, wars, and exploitation.\n\nSpeaking of exploitation, north of Galicia, a conglomerate of partisans originating from the football club Widzew Łódź has formed the Kingdom of Judah. Although it does not yet have a messiah, considering the irrationality of the entire situation, this would surprise no one. They are currently engaged in a struggle against the Visigoths for their holy land - complete control over the city of Navis. However, looming on the other side is the Eastern Calisian Empire, which harbors ambitions of restoring the entire Imperium, potentially reducing the Kingdom of Judah to a minor province in its grand machinery once again.\n\nOn the opposite end of the divine state of Prophet Iaroslaus lies an equally peculiar entity rooted in Egyptian mythology. The mounds located in the city of Cracovia are proclaimed to be ancient pyramids! While this may not be the most coherent scientific theory, it did not prevent the establishment of the Pharaonate of Khrak. Here, the pharaoh lies mummified, not alive but at least not ruling. Unfortunately, the great regent, an oracle, and the court sorcerer, Astrampsychus, governs in his place. The burning question remains - will they succeed in erecting a Sphinx in the marketplace of Cracovia?"

unification.31.desc: "In a radio broadcast to all of Greater Poland, an address was given by none other than Ryszard Kalisz; though anyone who has been around the region can say that the man speaking was no longer the same person they knew him as before the Fall, going under the name Ricardus Calisius, all signs point to the politician seeking to establish a new Roman Empire in the heart of Poland. Through skillfully swaying the local political figures, he had managed to become a major contender in the region through semi-modernized Roman reforms. An army of legionaries, coinage with the Emperor's visage, and new marble buildings soon to be constructed in recently romanized cities really give off the look of being brought back to the distant past. It remains to be seen what will arise from this state of pseudo-Roman reenactors, though it goes without saying that even if their folly is to end, the Polish-Roman state will no doubt go down in history as yet another in a long list of oddities resulting from the Fall."

Latinized signage branding the city as Posnania has already sprung up in place of the old road signs and plaques on administrative buildings. However, for most of the newly integrated population, life may not be getting much brighter as only a select few are granted the honor of becoming \"citizens\" of Calisia, the rest ending up as an underclass, referred to as the Veneti, as per the ancient name for the barbarian kingdom once-present on these lands. Worryingly, those not of Polish descent within the so-called Republic have found themselves subject to slavery and systematic repression. Calls from the UN to stop this treatment of especially German citizens have fallen on deaf ears, and an extraordinary summit to debate on the issue will be held in Berlin in the coming months."

As with the lands formerly integrated into the nation's structures, countless civilians have found themselves on the receiving end of Calisian repression. Even foreign delegations arriving in the capital of the same name have found themselves branded as Barbarians and treated far worse than the region's citizens. It is unclear if European structures will permit trade with the state, despite the efforts undertaken to entice foreign investment. Though few would like to admit it, with each day, it becomes clearer that those wishing to establish an embassy in Poland may soon need to throw out their Polish textbooks and pick up a new set for learning Latin."

The Optimates, one of the factions within the Calisian Senate, managed to fully consolidate their power and reduce the Emperor to the status of a proud lion in a gilded cage. Nobles and patricians rejoice around the whole Empire as their power over the plebians and barbarians stands unbroken in their new utopia - One stained with the blood of dissenters and all deemed unworthy of becoming citizens.

As the ruler enjoyed himself, celebrating with his many guests, the three conspirators, accompanied by a large escort of Senate Guards, Legionaries, and Praetorians, seized the Augustus and ended his life with numerous dagger stabs. The Calisian Triumvirate was born through tyrannicide and as Imperial blood soaked the pavement, the conspirators spread out to finalize the seizure of power.

Today, a grand ceremony took place in the Calisian capital, where Christianus Cinastovicus proclaimed the unification of all the lands of Polonia. Three loud \"Ave!\" echoed across the city before a massive parade marched to the cheers of a crowd of ecstatic citizens. With the land united, the Praefectus Praetoriae directs his gaze inwards. The Guard cannot rule on its own, no matter how many fake smiles it forces out of the populace. To secure his legacy, Cinastovicus must find a partner-in-crime.

How he ended up in this place is not entirely known; after the fall of the Navis metropolis, through winding paths, he became a gladiator.

What occurred will be remembered in annals of history forever, as the Praetorians overpowered the few remaining loyal guards and swiftly, but mercilessly ended the reign of the Calisian ruler. The bleeding, dying Imperator looked on as the Praefectus Praetoriae commenced a purge against all still loyal to the fallen monarch.

This day, however, Praefecus Praetoriae proved everyone wrong, as in a morning speech to the Senate he addressed the allegations. With beautiful words and diplomatic finesse, he proclaimed that his goal was simply to end the tyranny of the Imperator and hand the reigns of power to the Consuls of the Senate. To standing ovations, he terminated his position of Dictator Perpetua and returned to his duties.

Local garrisons were dispatched to the breached gate, but soon, distress calls started to multiply as more and more border posts reported similar stories. With the crisis looming, the Senate called all the Senators in for an emergency session. A grand, heated debate ensued between the Populares under Compa who argued that the barbarians were refugees, and the Imperium, in its benevolence, should show mercy, while the Optimates under Caletus, wanted the Augustus to stand fast and destroy the invaders.

With the police stretched thin and the military tied in engagements outside the country, the German government has fallen apart and the power shifted to local warlords fighting each other for control. As tiny nation-states broke off from Germany one after another, the German people found themselves between a hammer and an anvil.

Soldiers of the invading force tore down the hanging Calisian banners and set them aflame, while some of the more industrious among them set their sights on the Imperial palace and its secluded riches. Roadsigns with the old, almost forgotten name \"Kalisz\" were set up yet again by the logisticians tasked with supplying the captured city. With the Augustus, along with his Senators, nowhere to be found, and with the remnants of the Legions hunted down or dispersed in deep forests, it is safe to say that nothing short of a miracle can save the Imperial dream of Calisia.

### CHARACTERS ###

POLITICS_RICARDUS_CALISIUS_DESC: "A former socialist, lawyer, politician - hardly the most respectable Cursus Honorum, although a typical one. For all of his life, Ryszard Kalisz felt some kind of yearning in the back of his mind. He could feel it while walking past the columns of the Supreme Court, inscribed with ancient legal maxims, watching Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra, or even just eating pizza. Whenever he held a speech, be it in court or in Sejm, he could feel the presence of someone far greater and wiser than the jury or the Marshal of the Sejm behind him. Back then, he would simply dismiss it and carry on. \n\nIt was right after the Fall his inner consciousness had awoken. Running away (either from the blast or the angered mob), he hid in a wine cellar in Kalisz. Whatever happened there will be forever shrouded in mystery. On the third day, he emerged, draped in a bedsheet tinted purple with Latium wine, with a golden laurel on his head and perfect knowledge of all five Latin declensions. \n\nHowever odd Kalisz wouldn't seem, the locals did greatly appreciate his restlessness and organizational talent. No one batted an eye when he ordered officials to wear togas or enforced Latin nomenclature. However, when he proclaimed himself the descendant of Jupiter, some people thought he might be going too far. By then, however, his rule had already been cemented. Kalisz approached members of local elites and offered them an attractive deal: land in exchange for political power. Soon afterward, the Senate convened and proclaimed Kalisz - now Ricardus Calisius - first, a consul for life and, soon after - the emperor of Calisia. The new dictator's first edict shocked many to the bone: he reinstituted a form of indentured servitude, which turned out to be little more than thinly veiled slavery. \n\nCalisius walks a tightrope between the Optimates, which aim to seize as much wealth and power as possible, and the Populares, who point out the crying inequality in the nascent empire. The conflict is amplified by the uncertainty surrounding Calisius' mental state. As mad as he seems, he did manage to reforge this piece of post-Fall Poland into a strong, well-functioning statelet. His past made many think he'd turn out to be an opportunist, but his decision to uphold democratic traditions by empowering the Senate proved he is just as much a Cincinnatus as an Augustus. The true extent of the Emperor's ambition - or folly - will soon be unraveled..."
POLITICS_pawel_delag_DESC: "Once upon a time, an actor named Paweł Deląg played a bad-boy-turned-good-guy Marcus Vinicius in a grandiose ancient Rome epic called Quo Vadis. Thus, he earned a certain fame and reputation as \"Poland's sexiest actor of 2001,\" while helping shape the image of a gory, immoral Roman Empire transforming into a more humane, Christian Europe. \n\nThat is  perhaps why Deląg, as soon as the atomic dust settled, moved to where ruins were modern and reconstruction was ancient.\n\nIt's hard to assume whether he offered his services to Calisius out of conviction, lust for power, pure opportunism, or if he was simply bought. Nonetheless, placed at the helm of the legions, he quickly became the icon of the regime, most likely because he was the one who truly seemed like he was the right man in the right place. The people listen to his words, and the affection with which legionaries follow him would be hard to outweigh with money. Magnanimous, outgoing, and tolerant, Vinicius quickly became an influential ally of the Populares, believing that the new Eternal City could be a place where everyone could be a citizen of equal rights and duties; where bread and circuses serve a better purpose than controlling the masses. \n\nMarcus' charm and popularity act like a column holding Calisius' regime standing. It would seem the Emperor's past makes him sympathetic to the Populares' ideas. The Caesar could not think of a better friend... But can a friendship last forever?"
