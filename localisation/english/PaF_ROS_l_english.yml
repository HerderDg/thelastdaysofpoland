rosja.2.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Russian Intervention in Masuria Fails"
rosja.2.desc:0 "History repeats itself, this time as a farce. Western Military District of Russia has failed miserably in a fight with a few disorganised warlord states of Polish Anarchy, banded into Anti-Russian Front. Russian military has found itself stuck in the lakes and forests of Masuria, ill-prepared for offensive in harsh terrain and constantly harrased by Polish partisans (which, as most commentators believe, were armed and trained by foreign experts). \n\nA ceasefire has been signed, and the Russians have agreed to retreat from all territories previously owned by Poland. The little prestige Russia still enjoyed is lost, and the world's laughingstock country is in a state of unrest. It is expected that Kaliningrad will witness a rapid collapse of current authority and a brutal struggle for power."

rosja.3.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Russians Invade Masuria"
rosja.3.desc:0 "Many thought is was but a matter of time until Russians would try to move their forces further into Polish territory. Recent proclamation of authorities of the Western Military District about the commencement of "special dewarlordisation operation" has made it clear this time came now. \n\nRussian forces subordinate to the District have attacked Polish positions on the whole lenght of the border in Warmia and Masuria regions. Although this is nominally a rogue action by the Kaliningrad authorities, the Russian government hasn't responded to it, and Russian forces in Belarus are not crossing the border. There is no consensus as to whether this is Kremlin's plan to localise the conflict, attempt at bogging down some rivals in the power struggle or an actual incapability of containing the westernmost subject. \n\nPolish warlords engaged by Russian forces have put aside their differences and united to fight the common enemy in an Anti-Russian Front. This is most likely a pointless gesture of solidarity, as Russians boast complete technological, logistical and numerical advantage. The operation is expected to last a few weeks at worst."
