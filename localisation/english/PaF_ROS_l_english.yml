POLITICS_VLADIMIR_PUTIN_DESC: "Merely a decade ago, Vladimir Putin could claim to be the world's most powerful man. By his decree, new countries were born, while others died under the tracks of Russian tanks. With only a single word, he could make the world tremble in fear as he played the western powers like a fiddle, meticulously growing Russia's influence from the neutered republic he inherited from Yeltsin to once again being the planet's second and Eurasia's foremost superpower. It seemed Putin's legacy among the nation's greatest leaders was forever secure, the only questions surrounding his reign being which monicker would best describe his achievements in the annals of history once he steps down in triumph at last. But all statesmen eventually make a fatal mistake, and it took only one miscalculation for the house of cards that kept the President in power for nearly a quarter of a century to crumble.  \n\nOn the muddy fields of Ukraine Putin's reputation as the king of Realpolitik died along hundreds of thousands of Russian men as the country became a diplomatic pariah, supported only by a handful of third-world dictators. As soon as the army retreated back across the border in shame, the jackals in Moscow began planning their leader's downfall. Oh, how fickle is the will of the oligarchs that the second their benefactor ceased to bring them wealth and glory, they abandoned the ship, leaving the captain to go down with it alone?  \n\nIn the end, it was the one man who dared to openly defy Putin at the height of his power that would end up taking his throne. Supported by the internal opposition, the wealthy elites and western capital alike, Navalny barely had to break a sweat to oust his predecessor. Abandoned by all but his closest allies, only the exclave of Kaliningrad proved to be safe from the new leader's wrath.  \n\nNow reduced to a mere rump state, his health ailing, Putin plots his return back home at any cost. The collapse of Poland has been a blessing. Perhaps if he manages to conquer Russia's age-old enemy, the kingmakers in the capital will see him as their hero once more and he'll reclaim his rightful place in the sun, the perfect final chapter for the Motherland's greatest soldier."

rosja.2.t: "[GetNewspaper]Russian Intervention in Masuria Fails"
rosja.2.desc: "History repeats itself, this time as a farce. The Kaliningrad Government has failed miserably in a fight with a few disorganized warlord states of Polish Anarchy, which have banded together to form the Anti-Russian Front. The Russian military has found itself stuck in the lakes and forests of Masuria, ill-prepared for an offensive in such harsh terrain and has been constantly harassed by Polish partisans. \n\nA ceasefire has been signed, and the Russians have agreed to retreat from all territories previously owned by Poland. The little prestige Putin's government still enjoyed is lost, and the world's laughingstock country is in a state of unrest. It is expected that Kaliningrad will witness a rapid collapse of its current authority and a brutal struggle for power."
rosja.2.a: "A Miracle on the Masurian Lakes?"

rosja.3.t: "[GetNewspaper]Russians Invade Masuria"
rosja.3.desc: "Many thought it was but a matter of time until Russians would try to move their forces further into Polish territory. In a recent proclamation from the authorities of the Western Military District about the commencement of 'special dewarlordisation operation' has made it clear this time has come now. \nAlthough the attack is nominally a rogue action by the Kaliningrad authorities, the Russian government hasn't given an official response to it, and Russian forces in Belarus are not crossing the border. There is no consensus as to whether this is the Kremlin's plan to localize the conflict, attempting to bog down rivals in the power struggle or an actual insubordination of the westernmost subject. \nPolish warlords engaged by Russian forces have formed the Anti-Russian Front. Despite their desperate defense, the operation is expected to last a few weeks at best due to complete technological, logistical and numerical Russian advantage."
rosja.3.a: "Russians in Poland? Nothing new."

rosja.4.t: "[GetNewspaper]Yevgeny Prigozhin dies in helicopter accident!"
rosja.4.desc: "Yevgeny Prigozhin, the notorious leader of the Russian Military Administration in Poland, has died in a helicopter crash under mysterious circumstances. The aircraft, reportedly en route to a military installation in Kaliningrad, went down in a remote area, killing everyone on board. \n\nOfficial reports cite stray anti-tank grenade fired by Polish partisans, led by Sikorski, as the cause of the crash. Many experts, however, are skeptical of this explanation, pointing to Prigozhin's recent plot to overthrow Vladimir Putin as a possible motive for assassination. \n\n By eliminating Prigozhin, Putin may have sought to remove a potential rival and send a message to others who might consider challenging his authority. The full circumstances surrounding the crash remain under investigation, with many questions yet to be answered."
rosja.4.a: "Guess he didn't want to jump off the window"

rosja.5.t: "[GetNewspaper]Yevgeny Prigozhin coups Putin's government"
rosja.5.desc: "The scarce news that broke through the fierce media censorship within the rump Kaliningrad state appears to indicate a sudden, likely violent, change of leadership. Following the failure of Putin's forces to expand their southern buffer zone into Warmia-Masuria, and their even more unlikely retreat at the hands of a motley coalition of local warlord statelets, what little respect the long-standing president held among his clique has finally withered away. In the early morning sun, Wagnerite tanks rolled across Sovetkiy Prospekt, shelling the government offices into submission until those still loyal to the old administration eventually waved the white flag. The abrupt changing of the guard signals a shift toward increased militancy and jingoism within the solitary exclave, and thus far, it seems unlikely that Yevgeny Prigozhin will find its borders sufficient to contain his ambitions."
rosja.5.a: "One of the last threads of the old world - severed."

unificationreg.56.t: "[GetNewspaper]Western Military District of Russia conquers Warmia and Masuria"
unificationreg.56.desc: "Yet another mortal enemy of the Polish nation has again taken a part of it for themselves. Authorities of the Western Military District of Russia have proclaimed they've successfully occupied the whole former Warmian-Masurian voivodeship. Although resistance among the civilian population is significant and guerillas are abundant, main urban centers are fully controlled by the Russians. \n\nAlthough the result of the conflict was predictable, the fate of Russian-occupied Poland is not. Many claim a Polish puppet state will be established, others suspect a more eclectic statehood emerging on the former Prussian lands, while some expect simply military occupation or annexation. \n\nNo one doubts that Russia won't stop at this stage, and will sooner or later attempt to devour further pieces of Poland. However, as fear, hate, and resentment grow, it seems certain that another invasion will be met with much stronger resistance."
unificationreg.56.a: "Another Partition."
