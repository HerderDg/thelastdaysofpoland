####NOWE/NASZE LOCALISATIONS####
 melee_equipment:0 "Melee Equipment"
 melee_equipment_desc:0 "Category of equipment including weapons and tools that find their use in warzones - shovels, knives, picks and clubs to dig holes in earth and in enemy skulls."
 melee_equipment_0: "Found & Selfmade Melee Weapons"
 melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "Baseball bats, kitchen knives, batons, knuckledusters, metal pipes, garden tools, glass shivs, etc. - anything that can be found in a house, a warehouse, an abandoned kiosk, in your grandpa's garden or made with your own hands. Not very sophisticated, nor very useful against someone with a gun."
 melee_equipment_1: "Standardized Old Melee Weapons"
 melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "Found machetes, axes, tools and hunting knives that could be used in an army, renovated and standardized across our ranks, so that our sappers no longer have to dig with sticks and soup spoons."
 melee_equipment_2: "Purpose-Made Melee Weapons"
 melee_equipment_2_desc:0 "Tools and melee weapons designed in mind with urban and trench combat. Slightly reminiscent of WW1 trench weaponry."
 melee_equipment_3: "Army Melee Equipment"
 melee_equipment_3_desc:0 "Knives, shovels and other equipment that whould serve well in a modern army, with an additional renovated antique saber or shovel thrown in here and there among melee stormtroopers, just to make your ancestors extra proud."
 melee_equipment_4: "Top-Quality Melee Equipment"
 melee_equipment_4_desc:0 "Top notch modern military melee equipment that looks straight out of an American shop for knife enthusiasts. All multi-purpose, all cold to the touch, all black as death in colour (with cool white finishes near the edges)."
#melee upgrady
 melee_weapons_upgrade:0 "Serrations"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_desc:"In post-Fall Poland, brute strength is the be-all, end-all argument. No one cares about the rules of war - everyone is an acceptable casualty. Especially since people die left and right even outside of battle, due to the lack of medical goods and infrastructure. The only way to avoid death here is to play dirty, and speaking of "dirty": all these rusty knives and tools lying around could come in handy, especially with some new teeth carved onto their blades."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_1:0 "Proper Refurbishment & Maintenance"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_1_desc:0 "Our soldats have received weapons matching their role. They've been properly refurbished - they're theirs now, so they need to last for long and be in good condition. By giving our troops a basic rundown of how to maintain them and providing army-wide access to equipment such as grit paper, sharpening stones and heavy-duty tape we can ensure that their weapons won't snap in half or turn out to be completely blunt while they try to batter someone down with them."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_2:0 "Hand-to-Hand Combat Training"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_2_desc:0 "Stabbing without getting stabbed back. Pacifying enemy combatants with a single baton hit to the head. Taking accurate axes swings at enemies. Studying the blade. \n\nBy training our close quarter divisions the art of hand-to-hand combat we ensure that when two bunches of brutes meet on the battlefield, the bunch of brutes that belongs to us will come out on top."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_3:0 "Safe Engagement Tactics"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_3_desc:0 "As all rabble armies and bandit groups evolved into proper armies, guns became a mainstay on Polish battlefields. If we are to continue using troops dedicated for point-blank range combat, we have to engineer tactics that will allow our men to close the distance between them and enemies without taking 20 bullets to the face first."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_4:0 "CQC Mastery"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_4_desc:0 "We have mastered urban close quarters combat thanks to a confluence of innovative infiltration of enemy positions and skillful positioning and movement. Cunning and deadly effective, our melee-oriented stormtroopers are able to uphold and penetrate any city defense lines with ease."

 ranged_equipment_desc:0 "Category of equipment including weapons used from afar - firearms and bullets, primitive missile weapons and thrown weapons like javelins, knives, axes or even rocks."
 ranged_equipment_0:0 "Thrown Weapons"
 ranged_equipment_0_desc:0 "Bricks and stones may break one's bones, but good luck trying to throw a fucking rock at someone who's actually armed."
 ranged_equipment_1:0 "Traumatic Weapons"
 ranged_equipment_1_desc:0 "Found or homemade traumatic weapons and BB guns. While using them in combat might feel silly, they might give you some edge over a bloke with a knife."
 ranged_equipment_2:0 "Makeshift Firearms"
 ranged_equipment_2_desc:0 "Homemade pipe shotguns and Bren- and Błyskawica-style SMGs. Just holding these in your hands makes you feel like a Warsaw resistance fighter."
 ranged_equipment_3:0 "Cold War-Era Firearms"
 ranged_equipment_3_desc:0 "Good ol' AKs and AK derivatives, along with other weapons commonly sold on the black market. While quite unwieldy in comparison to modern firearms, they more than make up for their weight and recoil with how easy they are to clean and maintain."
 ranged_equipment_4:0 "Modern Firearms"
 ranged_equipment_4_desc:0 "Rifles, carbines and LMGs used by most European armies. Now you only need to slap some underbarrel grenade launchers and red dots on it to top it off."
 ranged_equipment_5:0 "Modern Firearms & Attachments"
 ranged_equipment_5_desc:0 "Modern weapons with commonly available, standardized weapon attachments, on par with French and British pew-pews."
#ranged upgrady
 ranged_weapons_upgrade:0 "Weapons Of Ye Olden Days"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade_desc:0 "We lack guns, and we have to resort to using the simplest, most primitive ways to kill people from afar - that's why we should adopt the weaponry of our ancestors: bows, crossbows, slings and javelins - weapons that are easy to manufacture without industrial tools, yet can still kill and provide leverage over people armed with just shovels and bayonets."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade1:0 "Homemade Riot Shotguns"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade1_desc:0 "Traumatic weapons lack the range and stopping power of conventional firearms, reducing their usefulness outside of close quarter encounters. While we can't do too much about their effective range, we can, for example, adapt them to be used specifically at short-to-mid ranges and simply add more pellets per shot to increase their stopping power. Because as we all know - if a problem can't be solved by using a gun, then the best way to deal with it is to use MORE gun. \n\nMore shot, actually."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade2:0 "Safety Standards"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade2_desc:0 "It's understandably hard to make functioning guns with nothing but springs and pipes in barns and basements, but we should still include some standards of safety for our weapons so that they don't explode in our hands just because a small breadcrumb made its way into the chamber."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade3:0 "Cold War-Era Vision Equipment"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade3_desc:0 "We may have the weapons to conduct larger scale warfare, but we still lack the technology for it. Small-scale adoption of old, Soviet-era scopes, night vision and thermal vision equipment, as well as other devices used for tracking movement and viewing enemy positions could help us out in that department. Just don't use this stuff to spy on them while they're showering, please."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade4:0 "Special Ammo Types"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade4_desc:0 "One of the benefits of weapons from later NATO days is the standarization of calibers across weapon of the same type. Thanks to the fact that the same bullets match most guns in one unit, we can much more comfortably implement special ammo types into our army, as we no longer have to buy 20 different calibers serving the exact same purpose."

 infantry_training:0 "Rudimentary Infantry Training"
 infantry_training_desc:0 ""Jump, do ten squats, get down and give me twenty." The most basic physical training that prepares our boys for action."
 infantry_training1:0 "Basic Infantry Training"
 infantry_training1_desc:0 "Teaching how to provide first aid to fallen teammates and going through most basic battle tactics will sharply increase survivability of our troops and is the first step towards shaping them into a real army, instead of the more or less organized mob they currently are."
 infantry_training2:0 "Advanced Infantry Training"
 infantry_training2_desc:0 "An extremely effective and important way of training our soldiers' reflexes, aim and independent thinking in the heat of action is to set them off against each other in very intensive and painful paintball matches. Before implementing this system, we simply unloaded entire mags of paint balls at them."
 infantry_training3:0 "Advanced Infantry Training II"
 infantry_training3_desc:0 "Physical and mental training that ensures our men don't snap under the harsh realities of post-Fall combat."
 infantry_training4:0 "Advanced Infantry Training III"
 infantry_training4_desc:0 "Army command and warfare techniques that simultaneously prepare us for large-scale combat and don't neglect our experiences and ability to defend against guerilla tactics used against smaller warlord cliques."
 infantry_training5:0 "Advanced Infantry Training IV"
 infantry_training5_desc:0 "Ex-NATO-inspired methods of training armies, with improvements based on our own experiences in the Polish Civil War. With top-tier training like this and so much army experience, our enemies can count on us that we will be ready. We will be effective. We will be deadly. If a joint European-Russian invasion was to be launched, if the walls were to come crashing down - we'll make it through. We will fight back. And FINALLY...   perhaps FINALLY our soldiers will learn that "4" in Roman numerals is written "IV", not "IIII"."

 equipment_vests_0:0 "Semi-Standardized Found Uniforms"
 equipment_vests_0_desc:0 "Anything covered in camo patterns, from hoodies and boxer shorts to old army and scout uniforms. Most of them don't fit, have holes in them and aren't actually designed for combat."
 equipment_vests_1:0 "Basic Army Uniforms"
 equipment_vests_1_desc:0 "Basic army uniforms, sewn specifically for our troops. They can be used to help stop bleeding in a pinch, and unlike uniforms found on the street they don't make you itch like you've caught an STD."
 equipment_vests_2:0 "Uniforms & Light Ballistic Vests"
 equipment_vests_2_desc:0 "Light ballistic vests that can stop small caliber rounds without encumbering the wearer."
 equipment_vests_3:0 "Heavy Defensive Vests"
 equipment_vests_3_desc:0 "Better, heavier vests that ensure survival of their user in an unfortunate frontal meetup with a bullet."
 equipment_vests_4:0 "Advanced Ballistic Vests"
 equipment_vests_4_desc:0 "Highest-quality vests that are both light AND very protective. A Navy SEAL whould gladly wear one of those in combat."

 special_forces_equipment_0_desc:0 "Various found parachutes. Hiking boots for mountaineers and fisherman coats for marines. Flares and found smoke and flash grenades to provide cover while storming the enemy and extra-shiny shoe polish for our elite troopers - things of mostly civilian origin that can be repurposed for specialized troopers focusing on combat in specific terrain types."

 special_forces_training1:0 "Advanced Special Forces Training I" 
 special_forces_training1_desc:0 "More advanced special forces training that makes them more of a special *force* than a *special* force."
 special_forces_training2:0 "Advanced Special Forces Training II" 
 special_forces_training2_desc:0 "More advanced military training preparing our special troops for combat in especially difficult environments and scenarios."
 special_forces_training3:0 "Advanced Special Forces Training III" 
 special_forces_training3_desc:0 "Training of battle techniques employed by men from the harshiest regions and toughest units. Our mountaineers will shoot from around rocks and rough peaks like the Taliban, our forest specialists and guerillas will hide like the Vietcong, our marines will take the most fortified coasts like tsunami waves and our paratroopers will land safe and sound."
#kamuflaże
 camouflage_upgrade:0 "Matching Sizes"
 camouflage_upgrade_desc:0 "It's hard to run and shoot in uniforms and boots that are two sizes too small. We're better off sacrificing some extra time to find clothes that actually fit their wearer before handing them over to our soldiers. At least they'll no longer have the excuse that they can't march because their shoes are too small."
 camouflage_upgrade1:0 "Ghillie Suits"
 camouflage_upgrade1_desc:0 "Stealth techniques such as lying still or hiding behind trees may work well when you're playing tag, but they're not enough in combat situations where people *literally* chase each other to death. You can't just hope for the best and sit in a bush - you have to *become* the bush."
 camouflage_upgrade2:0 "Proper Camo Patterns"
 camouflage_upgrade2_desc:0 "Most of the camo patterns we've been using so far were based off of civilian, mil themed products that aren't actually viable for camouflage. Instead, we should re-adapt old camouflage patterns that we're actually designed for combat and tested in practice."
 camouflage_upgrade3:0 "Stealth Techniques Training"
 camouflage_upgrade3_desc:0 "Training how to use the terrain and your surroundings to your advantage and how not to accidentally give yourself away in the worst moment possible."
 camouflage_upgrade4:0 "Advanced Camo Patterns"
 camouflage_upgrade4_desc:0 "We shouldn't still cling to old, pre-Fall camo designs that probably still remember the Soviet Union when we have the means to design better, more advanced ones - like the ones used by proper, modern armies."

 equipment_armor_0_desc:0 "Found knee pads, elbow pads, bike and motorcycle helmets, etc. Won't protect you from a knife, but at least you won't scratch your knees if you fall to the floor after getting stabbed."
 equipment_armor_1:0 "Metal Armor"
 equipment_armor_1_desc:0 "Experimental metal armor designed to protect from melee weapons and shrapnel, slightly similar to the ones designed during WW1 for trench fighters."
 equipment_armor_2:0 "Stab-proof Vests"
 equipment_armor_2_desc:0 "Modern anti-knife vests, commonly worn around the world by security officers. Due to the de-armed nature of the Polish citizenry, they'll also find use here, on the battlefield."
 equipment_armor_3:0 "Riot Armor"
 equipment_armor_3_desc:0 "Big, heavy and imposing - three words that best describe the modern riot armor. Perfect for urban close quarters combat, they're THE best way to get out of a knife fight fully intact."
 equipment_armor_4:0 "Superheavy Riot Armor"
 equipment_armor_4_desc:0 "A brand new type of superheavy armor based on riot gear that has been adapted to modern urban warfare by additional bullet- and shrapnel-proofing. If you ever wanted to bumrush an MG nest as a medieval knight armed only with a sword and shield - now's the time, sire." #piąty tier lives
#armor upgrady
 infantry_armor_upgrade:0 "Cloth Armor"
 infantry_armor_upgrade_desc:0 "People suprisingly often forget about the existence of cloth armor, despite how many lives did it save in the past. It was the most popular type of armor until the Renaissance, and even then it went out of fashion only in the West. By coating our troops in thick jackets and improvized cloth armor we can protect their butts from a shank or two."
 infantry_armor_upgrade1:0 "Improved & Standardized Designs"
 infantry_armor_upgrade1_desc:0 "Instead of nailing together thick plates of metal in a random fashion and hoping they're gonna be actually useful, we should keep track of which designs are the most effective ones to then be able to replicate them. That way not only do we increase our effectiveness in battle, but also save a ton of metal from getting wasted."
 infantry_armor_upgrade2:0 "Endurance Training"
 infantry_armor_upgrade2_desc:0 "We may have the sharpest knives, the heaviest maces and the meanest bastards out of any army in Poland, but that still doesn't mean we won - because it ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward."
 infantry_armor_upgrade3:0 "Of Sound And Sober Minds"
 infantry_armor_upgrade3_desc:0 "Alcohol is often used by troops, no matter it's legal status in the clique they're serving. It does boost morale and help take a hit or two, but a constantly drunk soldier is a miserable soldier - stumbling by a road and unable to perform any advanced operations. We are above that. We look down upon the drunk, ragtag masses in filthy, piss-stained uniforms, proudly bearing our big, imposing riot gear, staring at them with disgust through our bulletproof visors. Our minds are sound and sober and our hearts are proud and healthy. We'll crush them like cockroaches."
 infantry_armor_upgrade4:0 "Intimidating Posture"
 infantry_armor_upgrade4_desc:0 "Tall, well-built soldier. Huge, heavy armor. Black, reflective face shield. A mace in hand... \n\nAnd a brown puddle in the opponent's pants."

 inf_anti_tank_equipment_0_desc:0 "Molotovs and cannons made from large pipes using calcium carbide as gunpowder and sharpened metal rails as ammo. While they lack conventional stopping power, they're sure to make a tank driver stop in place and wonder what the fuck did just happened."
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_1:0 "Improvized AT Weapons"
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Molotovs, homemade rocket launchers, AT mines, lunge mines and improvized, Tankgewehr or Uruguay-like anti-tank rifles with enough power to simultaneously dislocate the user's shoulder and slightly scratch tank armor with just one shot."
 inf_anti_tank_equipment_2:0 "Cold War-Era AT Weapons"

 inf_antitank_upgrade_desc:0 "By using special caps made out of weaker metal in our anti-tank weapons, we are able to limit the spattering of a missile/bullet/whatever else we're lauching at our enemies."
 inf_antitank_upgrade1:0 "Composite Rigid Armour Piercing Rounds"
 inf_antitank_upgrade1_short:0 "APCR Rounds"
 inf_antitank_upgrade1_desc:0 "An addition of a very heavy and tough metal core in the inside of a round grants better armor piercing capabilities as the core handles the responsibilities of a cap and a ballistic cap."
 inf_antitank_upgrade2:0 "High Explosive Anti-Tank Missile"
 inf_antitank_upgrade2_short:0 "HEAT Missiles"
 inf_antitank_upgrade2_desc:0 "A staple of modern personal anti-tank weapons. Such missiles upon a hit create a stream of high-velocity metalic superplastic that is capable of penetrating even the biggest and strongest armors."

 motorbike_equipment:0 "Motorbikes"
 motorbike_equipment_desc:0 "It's common in Poland to laugh at motorcyclists and call them "organ donors" and suicidal speedfreaks. In combat, however, their speed can prove to be quite useful, since it's more likely that you'll die to a stray bullet than in a motorcycle accident anyway."
