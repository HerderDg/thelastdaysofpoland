unification.128.t: "[GetNewspaper]Duchy of Rzeszów unifies Subcarpathia!"
unification.128.desc: "When the Ukrainian invasion pushed Grzegorz Braun's forces to their final defensive positions in the city of Rzeszów, almost everyone expected the Mad Regent's reign to meet an abrupt and untimely end. And yet, through dogged defense and a fortunately timed uprising disrupting the invaders' ability to maintain their pressure, Braun's regime stood tall, its defiance inspiring many to take up arms and ensure Subcarpathia's complete subjugation. Having snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, the Duchy of Rzeszów emerges stronger than ever, ready to enact revenge upon those who nearly brought upon its downfall. Across the region, the Ukrainian population trembles in fear, hurriedly attempting to flee across the eastern border. But even though they face the brunt of the Regent's wrath, they aren't the only ones facing brutal repressions, as Braun's growing paranoia has led to him seeing dangers to his rule around nearly every corner. Only those who manage to escape the region can truly be considered safe."
unification.128.a: "Their blood shall cleanse the Polish nation."

super.128.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.128.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.128.a: "United at last."

rzeszow_siege.2.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Siege of Rzeszów"
rzeszow_siege.2.desc: "For the past month we've been hearing tales about Braun's guerilla campaign against the Ukrainian humanitarians and the following breakup of the Ukrainian Humanitarian Mission. However, judging by recently appearing hearsay, shit has hit the fan for Braun and now his small duchy has found itself sieged down by the newly-revived UPA and a Polish-Ukrainian 'Cossack' host. \n\nRefugees and couriers from Rzeszów speak of the city's populations' simultaneous high organization and second hand-embarassment from Braun's actions, and all-time high morale amongst Braun's loyalists, who now claim that they've been 'right all along'. Both Ukrainian armies seem hellbent on exacting revenge on Braunists, and it's unclear whether the civilians will come unscaved from this conflict if some more radical party wins the race to capture the city first. May God be with the commonfolk of Subcarpathia, for *they* are the real losers of this conflict."

RZE_patodeveloperka: "Patodeweloperka"
RZE_patodeveloperka_desc: "Patodeweloperka (patho-development) is a Polish word created to describe the free reign of real estate developers and lack of city planning. While it is a problem in most cities, Rzeszów is one of the most affected, especially with the No Government Intervention policy implemented by Braun."
RZE_ukrainian_siege: "Ukrainian Siege"
RZE_ukrainian_siege_desc: "After the Ukrainians pulled off the impossible and drove back the Russian invasion, Braun - a staunch Russophile with ties to Moscow - openly denounced Zelensky's government, seeing him as a wrench in the cogs of the Russkiy Mir. As such, when the Ukrainians entered the Subcarpathian Voivodeship to establish the Ukrainian Humanitarian Mission, he started a guerilla war against them, seeking to drive them back to their side of the border. \n\nAnd so - he fucked around and found out, and now Rzeszów is completely cut off from the outside world from the east by disgruntled Ukrainian ex-soldiers-turned-UPA LARPers who want to take revenge for how the Poles welcomed their help offer, and from the other side by a joint coalition of humanitarians and local natives who now brand themselves as a Cossack host. Unless he'll find a way to break the Ukrainian blockade, Braun's holy duchy will become what he fought - a burning pile of rubble, driven over by T-80s and BMPs."
