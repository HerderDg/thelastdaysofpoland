eksrozpadnews.1.desc: "Recent reports from the Silesian Eurokommissariat reveal that the local administration may no longer be able to maintain peace on its territory, as a general strike has rocked the Copper Basin, escalating past the intervening authorities' ability to control the rebellious region's everpresent dissent. What started off as a series of isolated protests by the disgruntled miners quickly grew into an ad hoc separatist movement that aims to tear the region away from the European forces' grasp. While a pacification action has been called within the area to clear out any resistance hotspots, numerous sources report unease as to whether the events signify a broader trend of opposition to German presence in Southwestern Poland. With the situation approaching a breaking point, it appears that the coming weeks may provide the final answer as to whether the Eurokommissariats can survive on their own."

eksrozpadnews.3.desc: "What at first seemed like mere overtly optimistic hearsay has now been practically confirmed - the Eurokommissariats have begun to crumble, with the Polish 11th Armoured Cavalry Division being the first part of the European occupational army that completely broke off from the EK government. The leader of the unit - General Piotr Trytek - publicly declared that he will no longer serve under the 'pathological European regime'. \n- In these dire and awful times, we - as Poles - should stick together and put an end to arms dealing and illegal German settlement in the occupied areas together. Poland has not yet perished! - said Trytek in a message broadcasted from a captured radio station in Żagań. It is unknown if the German rule will try to retaliate, as for now no troops have been organised against the mutineers. Is it because the administration knows their sins and considers the mutiny as somehow deserved? Or because the European military is preparing against the unrest in the rest of the Kommissariats?"

eksrozpadnews.4.desc: "The decay of the Silesian Eurokommissariat has reached a new low, with the government of Breslau declaring a unanimous secession from the crumbling state. Tasked with serving as the city's temporary overseer to quell the uncontrollable spiral of unrest enveloping the area, Jacek Sutryk has instead taken up the role of Europe's Brutus and sided with the tide of patriotic rebellion. Though he has claimed sole responsibility for throwing off the German shackles binding Wrocław, it remains questionable whether Sutryk truly had much, if any, of a role in throwing out the local garrisons. Whatever the true dynamic may be, the loss of the largest city and primary hub of the region has dealt an insurmountable blow to the already struggling Eurokommissariat. At this point, only a miracle could pull it from the brink."

ekwrozpad.7.t: "The Judgment Day"
ekwrozpad.7.desc: "Helmuth Bluthgeld knew that the city was doomed. After his comrades had chosen to abandon the Eurokommissariats, nothing could prevent Freie Stadt Stettin's downfall. Now, his position was as worthless as his luxurious estate in Warszewo. He was packing his most essential belongings, as his subordinates would arrive at his house soon. Engrossed in his preparations and listening to music through his headphones, he failed to notice the sounds of gunshots and the furious crowd gathering outside. He knew that he hadn't done anything wrong; those ratty Poles deserved to be tormented and enslaved, for Helmuth, they were only mere animals. Bluthgeld only acknowledged something was wrong when he heard someone busting down the door.\n\n Infuriated mass stormed the Lieutenant Colonel's house. Fueled by the only objective to bring the Butcher of Szczecin to justice, they quickly overruned the residence. Helmuth barred himself in his bedroom, but no lock could have matched the blood-thirsty people. When he finally realized that his soldiers had abandoned him, he was already dragged outside by the angry mob.\n\n The streets of the luxurious neighborhood, predominantly inhabited by Germans, were stained with blood. Many houses were already engulfed in flames. Bluthgeld's closest neighbor, the garrison captain, had been hanged from a street lantern. Thousands of people were looting the mansions, transforming what was once a calm and peaceful area into a war zone. When Helmuth was brought to the center of the road, all eyes turned toward him.\n\n The first to approach was the well-known local grocery owner, Miss Grażyna. Her typically kind and calm demeanor was replaced by a fierce sense of vengeance. Wielding a metal bat, Grażyna moved slowly toward Bluthgeld. This monster had killed her only son and his beloved wife in their struggle against oppression. She shouted her pain at him, but when he looked back indifferently, Grażyna did not hesitate. The first swing was slightly clumsy, but the other was much more confident. Then next, and next, one after another.\n\n No one knew how much it took. Time seemed to stand still for the people who could finally unleash their anger on the killer of their families. The colonel was barely alive and unconscious by the time they were finished. While the crowd felt a moment of cheer, it was tinged with lingering dissatisfaction. Many believed that responding to violence with more violence was not the answer, yet after years of oppression and humiliation, it was the only thing that could bring them a sense of relief from their pain.\n\n When he woke up, the rope was already waiting for him. It was then that he finally realized this was, indeed, his end. No amount of beating or disgrace could make this man quiver, but when faced with imminent death, his facade crumbled. Helmuth fought in despair as two strong men carried him toward the execution site. He begged and pleaded until the very end. When the rope tightened around his neck, he cried. People waited no more. When the sound of a snapping neck echoed through the area, everyone fell silent. The Butcher was gone, along with many others, on that bloody day. No one dared to speak of this incident again.\n\n Szczecin was liberated, but at what cost?"

ekwrozpad.8.t: "East Szczecin Falls"
ekwrozpad.8.desc: "Szymon Koziatek had spent the past few days in tense anticipation. The German forces were in full retreat, falling back toward their homeland and leaving the Eurokommissariat Westpolen,and its loyal collaborators,exposed and vulnerable. Though he had worn the uniform of the occupiers, he had never truly betrayed his country. Every moment in service to that treacherous puppet, Donald Tusk, had filled him with quiet revulsion. From the beginning, Koziatek had worked covertly with the underground resistance, hiding his allegiance behind a carefully maintained mask of loyalty to Berlin. When word of the commissariat's impending collapse reached him, he moved swiftly and in secret. He dispatched a trusted colleague to contact the Griffin Guard in Szczecin, offering them a chance to strike as Lindner's regime teetered on the edge.\n\nLost in thought, General Koziatek didn't hear the soldier enter his office.\n“Sir?” the young enlistee said hesitantly, pulling him from his reverie. Koziatek returned the salute briskly.\n“Report, soldier.”\n“The garrison in Szczecin reports that a revolt has broken out in the city. Eurogouvernor Donald Tusk has ordered us to deploy the majority of our forces immediately to crush the uprising before it threatens Lindner's authority. What are your orders, sir?”\nKoziatek's face was unreadable as he considered the situation.\n“Prepare the trucks and fifty men. The rest will remain to secure the right bank until our return.”\n"Yes, sir.” The soldier snapped to attention and hurried off.\n\nThe road to Szczecin was eerily deserted. Fear of renewed violence had driven civilians indoors; curtains were drawn tightly, and shopfronts stood shuttered like hollow eyes watching from the shadows. Military checkpoints had been hastily abandoned, contributing to the emptiness that gave the landscape an apocalyptic stillness.\n\nAs the convoy neared the city, the distant sound of gunfire began to cut through the silence. The sharp cracks of rifles echoed across the Oder like a warning. The revolution had already ignited.\n\nThey saw the first signs of life as they crossed the Long Bridge. Griffin's flags flapped defiantly in the wind, raised high above barricades assembled from debris and looted German equipment. Armed partisans lined the bridge's far end, tense and ready, unsure whether the approaching convoy meant help or betrayal.\n\nKoziatek stood tall in the lead truck, arms raised and his uniform coat open just enough to reveal the red-and-white armband beneath.\n"My fellow countrymen, do not be afraid!" Koziatek's voice rang out over the hum of idling engines and the distant crackle of gunfire. He stepped forward from the lead truck, arms raised, his tone steady and resolute. "I come not as your enemy, but as your brother."\n"The time of German rule in Poland is over! Donald Tusk holds no power here, his regime crumbles by the hour. Today is where I stand with you - as a Pole."\n\nHe paused, letting the weight of his words settle.\n\n"I hereby relinquish control of the right bank of Szczecin. I return this city, this soil, to its rightful owners: you, the citizens of Poland."\n\nA heavy silence followed. Guns stayed raised, fingers remained on triggers, but eyes began to soften. Somewhere in the crowd, a Griffin partisan lowered his rifle."

ekwrozpad.15.desc: "Piotr Krzystek entered the city hall with unease. As he walked through the main lobby, he resolved to never again rely on a foreign force to accomplish what he should handle himself. The feeling of betrayal lingered deeply in his heart. He realized he had let down his people, but from now on, things would be different - and better. The emptiness of the quickly abandoned building was unsettling, with tons of shredded documents on the floor and every door wide open. Nothing resembled the atmosphere that used to be here. He approached the stairs. A stroll to the upper levels of the city hall evoked many memories in Piotr. Such as he used to greet his hard-working secretary, miss Grażyna. The always cheerful administration. All of this is gone, in the abyss.\n\nAs he approached his former office, his heart began to race. Could this be it? Is he back? His hand shook when he slowly opened the door. After taking a glance throughout the room, he froze. Krzystek looked into the eyes of his biggest enemy, Christian Lindner. He sat at his desk, in his chair, just like Piotr used to do. His heart filled with rage; the only thing he wanted was to tear apart the butcher who had oppressed his people for so long. He slowly approached and sat in front of him. Both men looked into each other's eyes with indifference.\n\nWhy have you stayed here and not escaped like your colleagues? - Krzystek asked with sincere curiosity.\n- I know my wrongdoings. I know what I have done and what I allowed to happen. Honestly, I never wanted this at all: the violence, occupation, and abasement. That slipped through my hands with continuous orders from Berlin and Tusk. You asked why I stayed; I did it because I wanted to face the consequences. I could not live knowing I did not do the bare minimum to atone for my sins.\n\nThat was not the answer he had anticipated. Piotr imagined this conversation differently. He, the savior, stands against the bloodsucking invader and frees his people. He never realized that the mirror had two sides. Linder was just a broken man, used by the system, much like himself. The devils responsible for everything that happened were safe in Berlin or buried underground. His city, the beautiful Szczecin, has played only a minor role in the complex game of international politics.\n- And what should I do with you, huh?\n\n- As I mentioned, I accept full responsibility for my actions during the occupation of Szczecin. Please, I was only a mere pawn in all this. I want to go home. I wish I had not left Germany and had returned to Wuppertal. I miss my country, Piotr.\n\nKrzystek thought for a while. Is it just to punish a man who only desires to visit his home? Is it fair to deny the people a sense of justice? Every decision seems to have its drawbacks. After deep calculations, he was confident about what to do."
