 LIG_nothing_ever_happeneds: "Nothing ever happens..."
 LIG_nothing_ever_happeneds_desc: "To put it simply, the League of Free Cities is a fragile democratic project. While it follows a lofty plan - aiming to be the ''perfect democracy'' with everything requiring a 2/3 of the popular vote to pass, and going of a decentralized leadership system - it has just one issue. It's possibly the worst political system you could choose in this country. With factions unable to agree on anything the government faces one vote of no confidence after another, triggering constant reelections which ultimately change nothing."
