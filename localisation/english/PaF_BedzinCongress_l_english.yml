bedzincon.1000.t: "Intercounty Calling"
bedzincon.1000.desc: "News from Sosnowiec! Włodzimierz Czarzasty has decided to organize a second Congress of the Intercounty in response to the tense regional situation. Invitations have been sent to all active members of the alliance, who, along with their delegations, are expected to arrive in three days at the congress, which will take place in Będzin, at the Będzin Arena sports and events hall.\n\nLittle is known about the exact reason behind this sudden decision by the leader of Sosnowiec. It is suspected that recent machinations related to the very city where the congress is to be held may be of significance here. The agenda of the meeting has also not been shared with the delegates, raising serious doubts about the legitimacy and goals of this congress.\n\nNonetheless, it appears that none of the delegations intend to ignore Czarzasty's summons. On the contrary, they are likely to seize every opportunity to fight for their interests on the stage of the Intercounty.\n\nTime will tell what this is really about."
bedzincon.1000.a: "Workers of the Poland, unite!"

bedzincon.1.t: "Congress of Będzin - Czarzasty's Opening Speech"
bedzincon.1.desc: "A warm welcome to all - delegates and guests alike - who have honored us with their presence at the Second Congress of the Intercounty. As one of its leaders, my heart is filled with joy when I see so many determined faces before me, ready to shape our future. We come from diverse backgrounds, but what unites us is this: we were, we are, and we will remain the foundation of socialism on Polish soil. Ladies and gentlemen, has our society ever been as divided since the time of systemic transformation as it is today? For over a decade, the Polish right wing led our country toward collapse - and, sadly, that collapse finally came. Now, in 2027, after two years of unrelenting civil war, we must finally ask ourselves: When will this hopeless struggle end? When will we begin working toward unity and rebuilding our nation?\n\nWe, here today, as the vanguard of socialist thought, say: \"Enough!\". We are choosing a different path - one where open deliberation, dialogue, and unity are our core values. Yet, even among those gathered here, situations arise that require us to act through other means. We are meeting here in Będzin not by coincidence. The authorities of both Czeladź and Będzin have betrayed the values we all committed to at the first congress. With a heavy heart, I must say that the politics they pursued were so reckless that we, as the New Left, had to intervene directly to prevent a split. But to calm any troubled minds - let it be known that the delegates from those cities are here with us. We still stand together. We exclude no one.\n\nWe have gathered here for a crucial purpose. The cracks in the foundation of our alliance cannot be allowed to repeat. That is why I appeal to all of you gathered here - let us open ourselves to dialogue. And the subject of that discussion must be our centralization policy. For too long, we've been stuck in separate quasi-state institutions. For too long, we've stood apart - united only in name. To unify the country, we must first unify the Left. We must set an example to every faction in this fragmented land, showing that just as we stand united here today, every true leftist should stand with us and begin the process of unification! In the coming days, we will be discussing many matters - economics, security, internal and external affairs. And also about how we can ensure that the Intercounty is not just a slogan thrown to the wind, but a real force that can change Poland.\n\nThank you once again for coming here.\nLong live the victorious people!"
bedzincon.1.a: "Welcome Comrades!"

bedzincon.2.t: "Congress of Będzin - Konieczny's Speech"
bedzincon.2.desc: "Comradesses, comrades, and comradely persons.\n\nIt is an honor to speak here on behalf of the delegation representing all the communes of Jaworzno, Mysłowice, Imielin, Lędziny, and Chełm Śląski. This very diversity proves that true unification is already underway - and frankly, I don't quite understand the emphasis Chairman Czarzasty placed on this goal. It is the Council of Communes, supported by the communal militias and Antifa, that represents the most community-driven model in the entire Intercounty. So I find it strange that those with the weakest social mandate are the ones here preaching about centralization. I was elected by dozens of councils to represent their interests to the best of my ability. You? You clawed your way into power over the corpses of others. So please, don't lecture us on how to achieve unity - we probably understand it better than any of you.\n\nTo everyone willing to work together on our terms, we say: \"Welcome!\" and extend our hand. To those who seek to discredit or interfere with our way of life by raising their hands at us - ...well, let's just say you know exactly what we will do with that hand of yours. It was our communes that stood on the front lines against the fascist raiders of Ziobro's. It was with the blood of our fallen comrades that we defended the Zagłębie, and we were the ones who felt that invasion the hardest. Our border is the most exposed to conflict with the constant warmongering of puppet prosecutors. We are the ones facing down Silesian agitators, who, under the guise of separatism, seek not to unite but to divide this nation! Day in and day out, we operate in Mysłowice and other Silesian towns to prevent the spread of brownshirt terror and hatred toward working people.\n\nBut - as Chairman Czarzasty rightly pointed out - danger also lurks from within. It's a good diagnosis, but as always, I fear the prescribed cure may be the wrong one. That's why I will do everything in my power to ensure that our interests are respected, and that proper conclusions and solutions are adopted. Unfortunately, there is an unspoken code of silence in our circles regarding inconvenient issues. Allow me, then, to elaborate on some of the problems our alliance is facing. Someone must be held accountable for the fact that what we've built here is not fully functioning. And the truth is... those responsible are among us right now. Because the greatest blame lies with..."
bedzincon.2.a: "...the system designed by Czarzasty!"
bedzincon.2.b: "...browshirt reactionaries in disguise!"
bedzincon.2.c: "...all of you, you are all complicit!"

bedzincon.3.t: "Congress of Będzin - Szwej's Speech"
bedzincon.3.desc: "Welcome, comrades, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Polish United... pardon me, of the Intercounty Workingmen's Association. In recent years, Poland has been burdened by much evil, injustice, and painful collapse. The ideals of socialism - steeped in the spirit of human freedom and respect for citizens' rights - have, in practice, suffered deep distortions. Words did not match reality. The hard labor of the working class and the entire nation bore no expected fruit. But I firmly believe those years are now gone, lost to the past. The first congress of our Intercounty was met with an enthusiastic response from the working class and the broad popular masses. In gatherings across the entire Zagłębie region, workers, intellectuals, students, soldiers, and all working people voiced their support and trust in the new leadership - leadership that will guide this region to victory.\n\nComrades! Let us not allow reactionary agitators and common hooligans to block our path. Let them stay far away from the pure current of struggle waged by the socialist and patriotic forces of our nation! Drive out the provocateurs and reactionary loudmouths! The state authorities will not, even for a moment, tolerate any action aimed against our national interest or our state system.\nComrades! Time is pressing. The parties of Zagłębie must get to work solving the everyday, difficult problems of our economy and state life. How can you help the party leadership and government today? First and foremost, by standing by your workbenches and posts, showing through intensified labor and learning your loyalty and devotion to our cause - the rebuilding of our country after the terrible downfall that struck our entire Polish world. Today, I call upon the working people of Dąbrowa Górnicza and all of Zagłębie: enough of rallies and Polish-against-Polish conflict! It is time to return to daily work, animated by the faith and conviction that a party united with the working class and the people will lead us to build a new path to socialism for all of Poland.\n\nBut above everything we should focus our attention and dedication to..."
bedzincon.3.a: "...an immortal idea of socialism!"
bedzincon.3.b: "...a fight with spit-flecked reactionary dwarves!"

bedzincon.4.t: "Congress Day 2 - Investment Cooperation"
bedzincon.4.desc: "On the second day of the congress, one of the key programmatic points became the establishment of a People's Reconstruction Fund - a joint initiative aimed at financing the most disadvantaged communities, areas, and populations that suffered the most during the Fall. However, the contributions to this fund are relatively limited and, unfortunately, cannot meet the immense demand for distributing aid to everyone in need. Delegations, made up of ministers responsible for the economies of the invited states, now face the task of deciding where these limited resources should go first.\n\nThe Sosnowiec delegation argues that urban infrastructure was hit the hardest. Riots, building collapses, and postwar destruction have left an enormous mark on city structures. To return to normal functioning, they argue, the focus should be on repairing major city roads, restoring the facades of key buildings, and clearing out structures that are now nothing more than piles of rubble.\n\nThe Dąbrowa delegation counters this by pointing out that urban infrastructure is useless if the economy is in ruins. They propose redirecting the fund toward reviving collapsed industrial plants, noting that some of them didn't fall due to the war, but because capitalism itself was the nail in their coffin. This, they argue, is where the debate must begin - on ideological grounds - as the restoration of these workplaces is an ideological imperative.\n\nThe Jaworzno delegation, on the other hand, expresses disbelief that anyone would focus so heavily on cities and industry while ignoring the basic conditions necessary for survival. They call for prioritizing the reconstruction of small suburban communes, many of which have worked tirelessly to feed urban populations. These communities, they argue, will become the foundation of the new society, and it is they who should receive the investments."

bedzincon.4.b: "Funding for urban infrastructure"
bedzincon.4.c: "Development of small suburban communes"

bedzincon.5.t: "Congress Day 2 - Common Market"
bedzincon.5.desc: "The culmination of the \"economic\" day of the Congress was a conference on the potential benefits of establishing a common market, which would ideally recognize the needs of the poorest and - through appropriate regulation - allow for the implementation of the old Marxist doctrine: from each according to their ability, to each according to their need. However:\n\nThe Sosnowiec delegation proposed the creation of a central authority to oversee all redistribution processes based on need. This idea, however, was heavily criticized by the other two delegations, who believe it could lead to inequality and injustice.\n\nThe Dąbrowa Górnicza delegation offered a counterproposal: they support the creation of a common market, but redistribution should not be based on equality, rather on what each member produces. They argue this would prevent resource cannibalization by societies unable to make practical use of those materials, while allowing producers to maintain control over what is created and redistributed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jaworzno delegation issued a firm ultimatum: they cannot agree to any intermediary or centralized form of a common market. Only complete and unconditional redistribution of goods for all can reconcile their position with the ideological demands of their allies."
bedzincon.5.a: "Common Market without material redistribution"
bedzincon.5.b: "Common Central Market organisation"
bedzincon.5.c: "Total redistribution of wealth to all!"

bedzincon.6.t: "Congress Day 3 - Armed Forces"
bedzincon.6.desc: "Day three of the Congress revolved entirely around the issue of forming a joint armed force that would represent the alliance on the international stage and serve as the primary military if (or rather, when) fighting resumes in Poland. Defense ministers from the member states clashed fiercely over the matter, and once again, consensus seems out of reach.\n\nThe Sosnowiec delegation put forward a proposal to create the Intercounty Army - a trans-warlord force in which all alliance members would participate. Command would be elected by councils, and the army would function independently from local armed forces, which would be reduced to mere local security units.\n\nDąbrowa Górnicza found the idea interesting but objected to the proposed command structure and hierarchy. They suggested instead the formation of Red Brigades, into which each member would delegate their local battalions under a shared command, but armies would remain their own.\n\nThe Jaworzno delegation rejected any concept of a unified army outright. They argued that the most socially just and effective solution would be the creation of local militias in every commune and city district, serving as grassroots defense forces against external threats while cooperating equally and horizontally with other militias for coordination purposes."
bedzincon.6.a: "Red Brigades"
bedzincon.6.b: "Central Intercounty Army"
bedzincon.6.c: "Militias in every commune!"

bedzincon.7.t: "Congress Day 4 - Internal Policy"
bedzincon.7.desc: "Day four began with several conferences addressing health policy, education, and the judiciary. These sessions managed to establish a basic programmatic framework, though it was soon overshadowed by a core issue: the lack of internal policy uniformity among member states. This culminated in a crucial debate over the centralization of domestic policy.\n\nSosnowiec made their position clear - they believe a coherent and unified internal policy must be pursued wherever common ground can be found. To them, this would serve as the foundation for constitutionalizing the Intercounty, becoming the binding force around which they could unite and clearly state: these are our values.\n\nDąbrowa Górnicza, however, took issue with the element of compulsion. While they agreed with the overall aim, they disagreed on certain specifics. They instead advocated for an amendment stating that the shared framework should be treated as an aspirational goal, but that each member state should be free to implement it according to its own legal interpretation.\n\nThe Jaworzno delegate struggled to contain his anger throughout, repeatedly interrupting other speakers and shouting that he had been sent there explicitly to prevent such interference in internal affairs. He insisted that each commune has the right to define its own identity, and that no \"centralist\" will impose social or legal norms on them."
bedzincon.7.a: "General guidelines for implementation"
bedzincon.7.b: "Coherent internal policy"
bedzincon.7.c: "Pluralist communal policies"

bedzincon.8.t: "Congress Day 4 - External Policy"
bedzincon.8.desc: "The end of day four was marked by a conference on \"foreign\" policy, intended to be pursued jointly - initially within the borders of Poland, and eventually on the international stage. A strong emphasis was placed on the notion that at the very least, externally, the alliance must appear as a united front, not as a collection of quarrelsome warlords vulnerable to classic divide-and-conquer tactics.\n\nSosnowiec stated plainly that they believe the alliance should pursue common interests as a single state, support one another in achieving shared goals, and strive to expand the Intercounty to include other states across Poland. The ultimate aim, they said, should be the formation of a Polish reunification front composed of all such aligned entities.\n\nThe delegation from Jaworzno seemed somewhat disconnected from the intended topic of discussion. Like a mantra, they repeatedly asserted that the alliance's core imperative must be the fight against fascism, and called for the creation of the broadest possible antifascist front - one that would root out every manifestation of that deadly political movement, both within and beyond their current borders.\n\nHowever, the most baffling moment came from the Dąbrowa Minister of War, who launched into a fiery speech proclaiming that it is the duty of their socialist civilization to bring about Poland's reunification on the barrels of their guns. He declared that the National People's Army, which he represents, would serve as the vanguard of a leap into the future, delivering liberation to every corner of Poland."
bedzincon.8.a: "VICTORY FOR THE WORKING PEOPLE"
bedzincon.8.b: "Common front to unite Poland"
bedzincon.8.c: "Strong anti-fascist front"

bedzincon.9.t: "Congress Day 5 - Centralization"
bedzincon.9.desc: "The final day of the Congress was the most central - in every sense of the word - moment of the entire assembly. It was then that the delegation leaders tackled the core idea behind their presence here: the potential process of centralisation, set to begin immediately following the Congress. Many observers considered reaching this point a miracle in itself, given that the talks surprisingly had managed to avoid total collapse at every preceding stage. Now, in the final stretch, the future of the alliance hangs in the balance.\n\nWłodzimierz Czarzasty laid out his vision, which, in its final form, called for the creation of a single state entity - one that would respect the autonomy of its constituent bodies but operate under a unified banner. He envisioned a true Union of Socialist Republics that would be strong and united. Although he rejected comparisons to the Soviet Union, the parallels were plain for all to see.\n\nKrzysztof Szwej, meanwhile, continued tirelessly in his role as this plenary's de facto Gomułka, asserting that only the national interest could unite everyone in the righteous goal of rebuilding the country. He argued that it is the nation - not ideology - that must be the imperative driving their efforts toward reunification. However, it remained unclear what concrete proposal Szwej was actually putting forward.\n\nMaciej Konieczny, on the other hand, voiced strong opposition, declaring that the only acceptable path was a decentralised commonwealth that would safeguard the interests of the people. He described a vision of the United Communes of the Zagłębie region as an ideal society where the rights of each minor commune are respected, and all work together toward the greater good, rather than being forced to choose the lesser evil.\n\nSo... what now?"
bedzincon.9.a: "Centralization in the national interest"
bedzincon.9.b: "Union of Polish Socialist Republics"
bedzincon.9.c: "Decentralized community of similar interest"

bedzincon.10.t: "Congress of Będzin - Conclusion"
bedzincon.10.desc: "The Second Congress of the Intercounty has just come to an end. Delegates are now mingling behind the scenes, discussing the implications of what was agreed - but all are in a state of surprise. The Congress did not end in scandal, and personal animosities were genuinely set aside. After the fiery opening speeches, the pressure seemed to lift, and - for the most part - they were able to debate both their common ground and their divisions in a constructive and professional manner.\n\nWhat does this mean? In short, a new chapter is beginning in the history of the Intercounty, which many had already written off as doomed to fracture. Perhaps, against all odds, this organism might withstand the turbulence, and once the principles of the Second Congress are implemented by the member states, they may well find themselves on the path toward building a lasting foundation - one around which other socialist factions may rally.\n\nIt also spells very bad news for the fractured factions across the region. Those who were counting on an easy grab by marching into the internally divided Dąbrowa Basin will now be met with a clenched iron fist and a united front against any would-be invader. It may well be that this Congress has sealed the region's fate - under the red banner."

Outraged by what they saw as a farce designed solely to undermine their interests, they chose to walk out of the congress and cut off all negotiations. In practice, this likely marks the collapse of the Intercounty in its original form.\n\nThe delegates have now returned to their city, where they are preparing a public statement for their citizens - denouncing the betrayal of ideals and announcing the beginning of a new path in the life of their state apparatus: a path of solitude. For no one else, they claim, can offer them the future they seek - a future they are ready to fight for, even if it means standing alone against the entire world."
