kacap.1.t:0 "News from the East"
kacap.1.desc:0 "In a shattered Poland it is often hard to get information about the political scene abroad. Not counting the rarely working and unstable internet, the country is cut off from the media and news from outside the country. However, from time to time the diesel generators at TVP headquarters have just enough power to maintain the ability of transmitting simple messages through television programmes. As rare as that, it happens that a television fanatic manages to record the latest recording of the “News” on their cable box. Through friends and family the CDs then make rounds and arrive in all corners of the country. In the end, for the n-th time one arrives at Jan Kowalski’s doorstep with a two day delay. The quality is not stunning and the majority of the data was lost in the fifth or sixth copy of the CD.\nHowever, one part of the news from abroad, those that actually interested Jan managed to survive."
kacap.1.a:0 "Wait, what happened?"

kacap.2.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Standoff in Moscow"
kacap.2.desc:0 "An Anti-Corruption regulation package proposed by Navalny has been accepted by the Duma. These new regulations are said to give the president the required tools to control the various subsidiaries of the national treasury. Navalny in his last appeal to the nation underlined that “The regulation package will allow for more precise control over funds and will prevent government workers in high places from enriching themselves.” When asked which state apparatus will be investigated first, he simply replied “The Rosguard”. General Zolotov, the Rosguard’s leader was asked about his opinion on the inspection of his “private army” in an interview. His answer was brief, however it spoke volumes: “We are not afraid of the inspection, all of our expenditures are scrupulously written down to the last period. However, President Navalny in reality doesn’t want to use these regulations to control state assets. He wants to use it to squash his opposition.” This situation won’t help the growing tensions between the Rosguard and Navalny."

kacap.15.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Moscow Surrounded"
kacap.15.desc:0 "Breaking News from Moscow speaks of rebellion in a local Rosguard brigade in relation to the anti-corruption investigation. Allow us to remind you that Navalny’s regulation package, often called by the opposition “The Tsaritisation Package”' have been used in an investigation into corruption within the Rosguard. The course of events is highly chaotic and unfolding as we speak, leading to us not knowing exactly what’s happening in Moscow, however eye witnesses mention that the Rosguard has taken over the main communications routes in Moscow. Additionally in the Kitay-Gorod region an intense exchange of fire was heard between Rosguard forces and the local Militia. We eagerly await more news from Moscow, however at the current moment, we cannot be sure of anything."

kacap.16.desc:0 "Chechnya’s Head TikToker, Ramzan Kadyrov has recently released a video on his account which talks about the “Swearing off loyalty to the Federal Government and the beginning of an operation in Dagestan.” Alongside the Mufti of Chechnya, he has proclaimed holy war, hailed a Jihad by muslims. In the early morning hours, videos from CCTV cameras in the city of Khasavyurt in Dagestan have been published online. The videos show Kadyrov’s men in APC traveling towards Makhachkala, the region’s capital. We await further news from the south of Russia."
kacap.16.a:0 "That's not a Coup. It's a Civil War."

kacap.17.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Red Dawn"
kacap.17.desc:0 "Eyewitnesses from the far eastern reaches of the Russian Federation speak of Russian flags being torn from buildings and replaced with flags... from the old Soviet Union. Today at exactly 12:37 in front of the City Council building Zyuganov proclaimed the People’s Socialist Republic of the Far East. It has been positively accepted by Asian countries like the PRC, Vietnam and North Korea. Local leadership along with Navalny’s “loyalists” evacuated to Khabarovsk, from where they will most likely travel further west. In the meantime President Navalny has appealed to the nation from the besieged city of Moscow, announcing Marital Law across all of Russia."
kacap.17.a:0 "This is how empires fall. Piece by piece."

kacap.18.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Son of the Immortal Snow-Capped Peaks"
kacap.18.desc:0 "Does another country need to be added to the map of Asia? Early in the morning, the Minister of National Defense Sergei Shoigu arrived by plane in Kyzyl with a large part of his staff. In his speech, the General, being Tuvan himself, described that he “Needs to ensure the Tuvan’s safety in these trying times.” Eyewitnesses described that along Shoigu and his staff, the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade had arrived from Ulan-Ude to form the backbone of the Tuvan army. Additionally, cameras at the Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow have registered General Shoigu’s plane being loaded with large crates. The Russian Federation’s Government has thus accused the General of stealing around 30 tonnes of gold reserves from the Central Bank."
kacap.18.a:0 "Gold isn't important. The Red Button is."

kacap.19.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Ghost of Kremlin"
kacap.19.desc:0 "Moscow without a president? Around 3AM Alexei Navalny had disappeared from the Kremlin. The cameras in a nearby hotel had spotted him getting into an unmarked military truck, guarded by soldiers, which then drove unnoticed through the Rosguard’s checkpoints and headed for Petersburg. At 7:42AM, President Navalny spoke in his newest proclamation from a so far unknown location about the need to escape from Moscow, citing threats over an attempt on his life by the FSB as the reason. At the same time the number of sides in this civil war has increased by one: “The Security Forces''. Witnesses speak of Bortnikov along a platoon of armed operatives entering the Kremlin. At this moment, the factions fighting for rulership of Russia include: Navalny’s Loyalists, Zyuganov’s Communists, Shoigu’s Tuvans, Bortnikov’s Security Forces, Zolotov’s Rosguard and Kadyrov’s Chechens."
kacap.19.a:0 "I have a feeling that's not all."

kacap.20.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Where is Putin's corpse?"
kacap.20.desc:0 "In the last few days, Moscow residents have reported that Putin’s body had disappeared from his tomb overnight. The citizens, wanting to put flowers before the tomb in the morning found it wide open and the former President’s coffin missing. As a reminder, Vladimir Putin died in 2024 of pancreatic cancer and had been buried in a specially constructed tomb in the Alexander Garden near the Kremlin. Putin’s old associate Dimitry Medvedev had admitted to the corpse’s “kidnapping” who is as of the latest reports located in the city of Omsk. He defended his actions by citing “Defending the President’s body from vandalism”. According to Medvedev alot of people showed up to Putin’s second burial, among others Alexander Dugin, known for his fervorous support of Putin... and his unorthodox worldview."
kacap.20.a:0 "Omsk? I wonder if Medvedev's gonna wear black hat..."
