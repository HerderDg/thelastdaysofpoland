kacap.1.t:0 "News from the East"
kacap.1.desc:0 "In a shattered Poland it is often hard to get information about the political scene abroad. Not counting the rarely working and unstable internet, the country is cut off from the media and news from outside the country. However, from time to time the diesel generators at TVP headquarters have just enough power to maintain the ability of transmitting simple messages through television programmes. As rare as that, it happens that a television fanatic manages to record the latest recording of the “News” on their cable box. Through friends and family the CDs then make rounds and arrive in all corners of the country. In the end, for the n-th time one arrives at Jan Kowalski’s doorstep with a two day delay. The quality is not stunning and the majority of the data was lost in the fifth or sixth copy of the CD.\nHowever, one part of the news from abroad, those that actually interested Jan managed to survive."

kacap.2.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Standoff in Moscow"
kacap.2.desc:0 "An Anti-Corruption regulation package proposed by Navalny has been accepted by the Duma. These new regulations are said to give the president the required tools to control the various subsidiaries of the national treasury. Navalny in his last appeal to the nation underlined that “The regulation package will allow for more precise control over funds and will prevent government workers in high places from enriching themselves.” When asked which state apparatus will be investigated first, he simply replied “The Rosguard”. General Zolotov, the Rosguard’s leader was asked about his opinion on the inspection of his “private army” in an interview. His answer was brief, however it spoke volumes: “We are not afraid of the inspection, all of our expenditures are scrupulously written down to the last period. However, President Navalny in reality doesn’t want to use these regulations to control state assets. He wants to use it to squash his opposition.” This situation won’t help the growing tensions between the Rosguard and Navalny."

kacap.15.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Moscow Surrounded"
kacap.15.desc:0 "As Navalny's anti-corruption regulations package (often called the “Tsarification Package” by the opposition) continues to sweep across the Rosguard's ranks kicking people off their post left and right, breaking news of a rebelling Rosguard brigade storming across Moscow have reached us. \n\nNo-one fully knows what's happening in the city as the course of events is highly chaotic and still unfolding as we speak, but eye witnesses speak of Rosguard taking over the main communication routes in Moscow. Additionally, in the Kitay-Gorod region, an intense exchange of fire was heard between Rosguard forces and local militiamen."

kacap.16.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Sacred War"
kacap.16.desc:0 "Chechnya’s head TikToker - Ramzan Kadyrov - has recently released a video on his account in which he talks about “swearing off loyalty to the federal government and the beginning of an operation in Dagestan.”, proclaiming a Jihad alongside the Mufti of Chechnya. \n\nIn the early morning hours, videos from CCTV cameras in the city of Khasavyurt in Dagestan have been published online. The footage shows Kadyrov’s men setting off towards Makhachkala, the region’s capital. \n\n\n\nIt seemed like Russia was about to see another August Coup. \n\nLooks like it will see a second civil war instead."

kacap.17.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]A Red Dawn"
kacap.17.desc:0 "Eye witnesses from the far eastern reaches of the Russian Federation speak of Russian flags being torn from buildings and replaced with flags... of the old Soviet Union. Today at exactly 12:37, in front of the city council, Zyuganov proclaimed the People’s Socialist Republic of the Far East. \n\nWhile most independent international observers have reacted to the proclamation with indifference, expecting a communist government to pop up in Russia, Western governments have shown concern over a potential return of the Soviets, and Vietnam and North Korea have shown support of the proclamation. Local leadership along with Navalny’s “loyalists” evacuated to Khabarovsk, from where they will most likely travel further west. In the meantime the Russian president has appealed to the nation from the besieged city of Moscow, declaring martial law in all of Russia."
kacap.17.a:0 "This is how empires fall: piece by piece."

kacap.18.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Son of the Immortal Snow-Capped Peaks"
kacap.18.desc:0 "Does another country need to be added to the map of Asia? Early in the morning, Sergei Shoigu - the Minister of National Defense - arrived by plane in Kyzyl with a large part of his staff. In his speech, the General, being Tuvan himself, described that he “needs to ensure the Tuvan’s safety in these trying times.” Witnesses described that along Shoigu and his staff, the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade had arrived from Ulan-Ude to form the backbone of the Tuvan army. Additionally, cameras at the Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow have registered General Shoigu’s plane being loaded with large crates. The Russian Federation’s government has thus accused the General of stealing around 30 tonnes of gold reserves from the Central Bank."
kacap.18.a:0 "It's not about the gold, however. It's about the Red Button."

kacap.19.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Ghost of Kremlin"
kacap.19.desc:0 "Moscow without a president? Around 3AM Alexei Navalny had disappeared from the Kremlin. The cameras in a nearby hotel had spotted him getting into an unmarked military truck, guarded by soldiers, which then drove unnoticed through the Rosguard’s checkpoints and headed for Petersburg. At 7:42AM, President Navalny spoke in his newest proclamation from a so far unknown location about the need to escape from Moscow, citing threats over an attempt on his life by the FSB as the reason. Additionally, footage of Bortnikov entering the Kremlin alongside a platoon of armed operatives can be found circling around the Internet. \n\nThe Security Forces have officially entered the Russian Civil War."

#kacap.20.desc:0 "In the last few days, Moscow residents have reported that Putin’s body had disappeared from his tomb overnight. The citizens, wanting to put flowers before the tomb in the morning found it wide open and the former President’s coffin missing. As a reminder, Vladimir Putin died in 2024 of pancreatic cancer and had been buried in a specially constructed tomb in the Alexander Garden near the Kremlin. Putin’s old associate Dimitry Medvedev had admitted to the corpse’s “kidnapping” who is as of the latest reports located in the city of Omsk. He defended his actions by citing “Defending the President’s body from vandalism”. According to Medvedev alot of people showed up to Putin’s second burial, among others Alexander Dugin, known for his fervorous support of Putin... and his unorthodox worldview."
