unification.45.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Eurokommissariat Schlesien unites Lower Silesia"
unification.45.desc:0 "Many water has flew through Odra river after collapse of Eurokommisariat. Few polish believed that this strange german occupation state would stay alive, let alone reunite Lower Silesia. However, Poles loyal to the leadership from the West, no matter if rightly so, showed enormous enthusiasm and effort in the fight for the former Piast lands.\n\n Grzegorz Schetyna, right-hand of the head of the PO party, now unquestionable leader of EKS, has become the main quarterback in the region. As a trusted man in Brussels, he was placed in the manager of Lower Silesia, which was less important than Pomerania and Wartheland for Germany. Despite this, having less influence and manpower  and questionable loyal vassals, he managed to lead the Polish-German forces to victory. EU officials come by train to take up important administrative positions. Now three flags are waving again at the Breslau town hall, only one is slightly above them..."
unification.45.a:0 "So much blood spilled and no changes."
