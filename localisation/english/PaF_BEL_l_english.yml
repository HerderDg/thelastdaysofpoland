unification.102.t: "[GetNewspaper]Belarussian Exiles occupy Podlachia!"
unification.102.desc: "In a completely unexpected turn of events, an unlikely power has managed to stake their claim over Podlachia. It is a well known fact that Belarus has been annexed into Russia some time ago, yet lesser known was the fact that the Exiles of its former government have managed to secure a position in the city of Hajnówka and its surrounding regions. Having braved the turbulent realities of constant war in Podlachia, they had managed to pacify the local population and create a faux Belarussian state in de facto Polish territory. Lukashenko in his radio address mocked the Pre-Fall government, claiming that the barriers they constructed now only served to keep him in Poland. Rousing speeches of reclaiming Belarus have been said a dozen times before, however the former president has thus far neglected to mention the future fate of Poland under his leadership. Only time will tell what moves the Exiles will make."
unification.102.a: "A Stranger in a Strange Land."

super.102.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
