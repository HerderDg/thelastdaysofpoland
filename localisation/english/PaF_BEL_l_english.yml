unification.102.t: "[GetNewspaper]Belarussian Exiles occupy Podlachia!"
unification.102.desc: "In a completely unexpected turn of events, an unlikely power has managed to stake its claim to Podlachia. Though Belarus's annexation into the Russian State is a well-known fact, most observers at the time have failed to notice that Exiles from the nation's former government have managed to secure a position in the city of Hajnówka and its surrounding regions. Having braved the turbulent realities of constant war in Podlachia, they have managed to pacify the local population and create a faux-Belarussian state in de-facto Polish territory. Lukashenko, in his radio address, mocked the country's Pre-Fall government, claiming that the barriers they constructed now only served to keep him in Poland. Despite numerous rousing speeches about reclaiming Belarus, the former president has thus far neglected to mention what fate is planned for Poland under his leadership. Only time will tell what moves the Exiles will make."
unification.102.a: "A Stranger in a Strange Land."

Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
