unification.115.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]DUPA unifies the Capital District!"
unification.115.desc:0 "The world gawks in awe as the most important region of Poland falls to the army of futuristic commandos with face-covering helmets and local hooligans led by a well-known comedian - Bartosz Walaszek. Their equipment is being financed by the collective effort of the local businessmen organized by Paweł Tanajno.\nWhile few believed those two showmen would succeed, their policies focused on lowering taxes and pizza-based social welfare seem to be working. Experts deduce the DUPA's strategy of gaining the attention of potential recruits by building glass houses, slandering John Paul II, trying to communicate with aliens, and generally raising as many controversies as possible... but those may be just their attempts at humor.\nTo calm the restless population concerned with the DUPA's victory, Bartosz Walaszek is giving a speech in front of the Presidential Palace assuring the Varsovians of his peaceful intents, quoting his "master", who "told him to avoid unnecessary fightes"."
unification.115.a:0 "Medium Hawaiian pizza for everyone!"
