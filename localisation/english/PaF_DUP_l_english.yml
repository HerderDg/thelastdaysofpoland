unification.115.t: "[GetNewspaper]DUPA unifies the Capital District!"
unification.115.desc: "The world looks in awe as Poland’s most important metropolis falls to an army of futuristic commandos with face-covering helmets, and armed hooligans under the command of a well-known comedian – Bartosz Walaszek, and funding by Paweł Tanajno’s business faction. While few believed in the eccentric duo’s success, it appears their policies, focused on tax relief and pizza-based social welfare have found their way into the people’s hearts. Experts heavily debate whether DUPA’s strategy of gaining recognition and stirring up recruitment through the construction of glass houses, slandering the late John Paul II, efforts at communication with aliens, and generally stirring up as much controversy as possible is a genuine attempt to govern the struggling nation or merely a cynical attempt at humor, but in a speech addressed to the restless Varsovians, the regime’s leader reassured the population of his peaceful intent, quoting the words of his enigmatic “master”, who supposedly told him to “avoid unnecessary fightes”"
unification.115.a: "Medium Hawaiian pizza for everyone!"
