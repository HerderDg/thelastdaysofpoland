unification.70.t: "[GetNewspaper]Hedonistic Republic of Winnygród unifies Lubuskie!"
unification.70.desc: "Lubusz Voivodeship has historically been a place rather forgotten by the wider Polish public. Today's news, however, will remain in the air for quite some time - especially amongst the members of the Ministry of Agriculture and those who enjoy the finer things in life. The Hedonistic Republic of Winnygród - as the joint clique of Zielona Góra's city council and Lubuskie's winemakers has taken to calling itself - has declared the complete conquest of the former voivodeship. All across their newly acquired lands wannabe alcohol manufacturers, pimps, and owners of other... *controversial* enterprises rejoice as their businesses can feel right at home in the semi-anarchic republic. Several high-ranking cultural institutions and prominent sommeliers across Europe have expressed words of gratitude towards this new state, commending its efforts in preserving Polish winemaking."
unification.70.a: "Next Page: Ex-singer DENOUNCES the newly-formed republic? A message from the town of Jasło."

unificationreg.70.t: "[GetNewspaper]Hedonistic Republic of Winnygród conquers Lower Silesia!"
unificationreg.70.desc: "Young in both age and spirit, the Hedonistic Republic of Winnygród - or rather of Silesia - shows no signs of stopping its drug- and wine-induced stampede along the Oder, as the last holdouts of Lower Silesian resistance of the post-Eurokommissariat governments either surrender or escape to Czechia, leaving Winnygród as the sole power controlling land within the voivodeship. \n\nWhile most of the region's population will have to forcefully adapt to the public displays of anarchy and hedonism the republic prides itself on, those more accustomed to a life of drinking and singing - the Romani of Legnica and Jawor and the alcoholics of the Wałbrzych Basin, are reportedly already openly celebrating the republic's victory on the streets, joining Winnygród's soldiers at banquets and sending poorly-written letters to Lubuskie's winemakers, thanking them for their intervention and wishing them the best in spreading their craft to Lower Silesia."
#unificationreg.70.a: "they did it for the vine"
unificationreg.70.a: "I feel like today's dinner could go with some dry white." 

unificationsupreg.70.t: "[GetNewspaper]Entirety of Silesia unified by the Hedonistic Republic!"
unificationsupreg.70.desc: "Although much more sober and organized, the armies of Upper Silesia have failed to stop the jolly volunteers of the Hedonistic Republic in their tracks, with the state's limited and largely nonexistent government banding together today to publicly declare the complete unification of the historic Silesian region. \n\nWithin the conquered territory, a wave of celebrations ensued, with the victorious soldiers spending the day overdosing in roadside ditches and crashing their tanks into random buildings, as thousands of citizens popped corks of smuggled and counterfeit champagne bottles and gathered together to honor the spread of the glorious Republic's libertine culture and laws, getting high off their newfound freedoms... \n\nand various other narcotics."
unificationsupreg.70.a: "All those spoil tips will make for fine vine plantation soil!... I guess."

super.70.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland - United in Ecstasy"
super.70.desc: "Today's events have left governments across the world dumbfounded, unable to decide whether the state now spanning the entirety of Polish territory should be treated as a real, internationally recognized country, or as yet another bunch of anarchist upstarts, doomed to quickly fall to other warlord groups. Both international media and the Poles themselves, however, unanimously proclaim one thing: \n\nThe Polish Civil War has finally come to an end, as indicated by the millions of people gathered on the streets, united in celebration, dancing and drinking whilst covered in vines and robes in what the Council of the Hedonistic Republic of Poland - as the new, largely informal and nonexistent ''government'' of the country is called - describes as the first day of the ''Eternal Bacchanalia'' which from now on shall engulf the nation in ecstasy and positive emotions, forever unifying the nation in spirit."
super.70.a: "Wait, I thought the Poles preferred beer over wine?"
