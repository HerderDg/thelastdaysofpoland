unification.70.desc:0 "Lubusz Voivodeship has historically been a place rather forgotten by the wider Polish public. Today's news, however, will remain in the air for quite some time - especially amongst the members of the Ministry of Agriculture and those who enjoy the *finer* things in life. \n\nThe Hedonistic Republic of Winnygród - as the joint clique of Zielona Góra's city council and Lubuskie's winemakers has taken to calling itself - has declared the complete conquest of the former voivodeship. All across their newly acquired lands wannabe alcohol manufacturers, pimps, and owners of other... *controversial* enterprises rejoice as their businesses can feel right at home in the semi-anarchic republic. Several high-ranking cultural institutions and prominent sommeliers across Europe have expressed words of gratitude towards this new state, commending its efforts in preserving Polish winemaking."
