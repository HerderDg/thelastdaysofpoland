unification.50.desc:0 "According to the latest reports from Greater Poland, the northern parts of this region have been reunited by the President of the city of Poznań, Jacek Jaśkowiak, which along with the remnants of his city and the Poznań County created one of the last bastions of the Pre-Fall Polish democracy. \n\nAlthough not very popular in Poznań, as a result of tragically poor renovations, the effects of which are still visible today, he managed to gain the support of the residents, the military and the newcomers to the region, to move west first, to unite the Poznań County, and then northward to unite a greater area of Greater Poland under their democratic ideals.\n\nEven though many of the consequences brought by this are still uncertain, the main course of action of the new Greater Polish Government will be to re-establish democracy across all of Poland."
