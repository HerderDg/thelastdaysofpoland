unification.50.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poznań Committee unifies Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.50.desc: "According to the latest reports from Greater Poland, the northern parts of the voivodeship have been reunited by the President of the city of Poznań, Jacek Jaśkowiak, who, both during his time as an EU-aligned collaborator, and later, in his new role as leader of an independent free city, provided one of the last remaining bastions of democracy in the region. \n\nAlthough not very popular in Poznań due to a series of tragically poor renovations, the effects of which are still visible today, he managed to gain the support of the residents, the military, and the copious newcomers, moving to unite the Poznań County first, and then proceeding northward to unite a significant chunk of Greater Poland under his ideals.\n\nEven though many of the long-term consequences of these developments still uncertain, the main course of action of the new government will be to attempt to re-establish democracy across all of Poland."
unification.50.a: "A stable foundation for the whole region?"

super.50.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.50.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.50.a: "United at last."

 POLITICS_JACEK_JASKOWIAK_DESC: "Noon has come and everyone around climbed over the ditches of digged out town square to watch Koziołki headbutt each other, but not President Jaśkowiak. He himself can be seen walking around the Stary Rynek often, but he is somewhat absent, as he is engulfed in his imagination. Walking around with a notebook he can be heard mumbling to himself... "Pride flags will go here... and bicycle lane will go along this way... and these empty concrete tree pots... could we make concrete trees too?". \n\nConcrete. Such a simple, yet glorious material. Fills out all cracks and solidifies the ground. Seas of this simple, corse, but heartwarming and weatherproof aggregate create roofs over peoples heads, streets for cars and pavements for pride parades. Truly a material worthy of a true modern civilization. \n\nSome people however disagree with President Jaśkowiak, they call out against the cold and gray, dystopian visage of Poznań. They simply don't understand the ideas of a true visionary. They are not ready to ride on countless bicycle routes. They are not ready to drive on the multi-lane Freedom Highway. They are not ready to attend enormous shopping galleries. \n\nYears have passed since he began putting his vision into motion. Taking the mantle from a PO-friendly, yet quite conservative Ryszard Grobelny, Jaśkowiak pushed on to liberalise the city's policies completely, supporting rights of women and sexual minorities while also renovating the city's infrastructure. Funding was scarce before the fall, as the PiS government despised President's LGBT-friendly policies and neglecting of local cathedrals and churches. Under Donald Tusk leadership, the German Armed Forces were dispatched to stabilise the country from self-destructive rule of PiS, while Jaśkowiak was one of the politicians that signed himself under this controversial plead to Brussels and Berlin. Thankfully, the concrete streets constructed throughout the city are solid enough to hold up columns of Leopard tanks. \n\nFor years most of the city looks like an artillery range with excavators and bulldozers scattered around and small squads of German and EU soldiers patrolling the streets. If only Berlin approved a higher budget for the renovations, the current crisis with people being forced to live in concrete tenements while entire planned districts lay haunted with only skeletal frames of future buildings, would be swiftly resolved. Instead the financial belt tightens up and soldier numbers keeping protesters in check decrease with each month. \n\n'No matter.' - says President Jaśkowiak, setting down his notebook on the desk in his office, after his walk. With a slight smile he looks out of the window on his city, pondering on which project to tackle next."
