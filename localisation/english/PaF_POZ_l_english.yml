 POZ_divided_city:0 "Divided City" 
 POZ_divided_city_desc:0 "Poznan, a city with centuries of glorious history, is now divided, if only for the fact that it suffered a lot during the disintegration and the chaos afterwards. Only the north-eastern part of Poznan remained under the authority of the democratic president Jaskowiak - the southern part of the city was overrun by bandits, anarchists and rappers and their fans, while the western part, as a result of the intervention of the Union, came under the authority of the Eurocommissariat of Western Poland, headed by president Jaskowiak's former friend, Donald Tusk. The fact that our city is so divided makes reconstruction, communication and the lives of ordinary citizens more difficult."

 POZ_anti_religious_fervor_desc:0 "Even before the collapse, the municipal authorities as well as the public were becoming increasingly hostile towards religion, but with the collapse the anti-religious sentiment of the authorities strengthened. However, the increasingly anti-religious stance of the government is arousing more and more indignation among ordinary citizens. There are also voices within the government to agreement with the church."

 POZ_the_last_stand_of_democracy:0 "The Last Stand of Democracy"
 POZ_the_last_stand_of_democracy_desc:0 "As a result of the actions of the authoritarian Law and Justice government, Polish democracy has collapsed. Despite the intervention of the European Union, it was not possible to save it, and so we have become one of the last places where democracy has survived. In spite of this, however, we must remain strong in the belief that the democratic order, the free principles of the Western world and human rights will return to all parts of our country. Our country is, by the way, headed by a man who has stood firmly for democracy for more than 10 years - President Jacek Jaskova. Under his leadership, we will not easily let the remnants of Polish democracy be destroyed."
 POZ_stranded_in_madlands:0 "Stranded in the Madlands"
 POZ_contact_westpolen:0 "Contact Westpolen"
 POZ_contact_westpolen_desc:0 "Poznan after the Fall of Poland was never a place where large armed forces were stationed. Its security structure was based on police forces and the support of the Eurocomisarist boss, Donald Tusk, a close associate of our President. In the current situation, when we are threatened by clouds of religious fanatics and Big Brother in the West is experiencing moments of difficulty, the inhabitants of the City are increasingly concerned. Assistance, even if symbolic, from Eurocomisarist would be of great help in calming the public mood and equipping at least part of our modest forces with decent armaments."

 POZ_approach_the_slums:0 "Approach the Slums"
 POZ_approach_the_slums_desc:0 "To the south of our state are the so-called Slums of Poznan. We have to decide what we will do about them - whether to try to compromise with them or to take back the districts of our city occupied by them by force of arms."

 POZ_trade_with_benefits:0 "Trade with Benefits"
 POZ_trade_with_benefits_desc:0 "The first step in getting closer to the Slums and establishing peaceful relations should be to establish trade relations between us. Both countries would benefit from this"
 POZ_proposition_of_normalisation:0 "Proposition of Normalisation"
 POZ_proposition_of_normalisation_desc:0 "Thanks to the fact that they have begun to establish peaceful relations with the Slums, we can go one step further, and propose the peaceful unification of the Slums into our state. Of course, this will be a compromise unification, however, we cannot allow a renewed intervention in Ratya, which could slow down our next actions, and bring huge losses in both our army and civilian losses. We must therefore make a deal with Peja, provided he agrees to our move."
 POZ_urban_warrior_of_democracy:0 "Urban Warriors of Democracy"
 POZ_urban_warrior_of_democracy_desc:0 "Thanks to the fact that Peja has agreed to join us, we are able to incorporate into our army previous Slum warriors who, when they know what they are fighting for, fight fiercely to the end, such warriors will be very useful to us in the current situation. Although we need to make them aware of the stakes they are fighting for, but when we do this, our army will gain many warriors who will always be ready to give their lives for our cause."

Our troops, standing in the streets of the Old Town and Łacina, are fully ready for action, and thanks to the actions of our activists, the residents of the slum-occupied districts are ready to help our troops if necessary. The time of lawlessness is over, it is time to bring order, democracy and freedom back to southern Poznan."
 POZ_pacification_force:0 "Pacification Forces"
 POZ_pacification_force_desc:0 "After reclaiming Rataj, Chartow and Wilda, it is time to restore order. As the remnants of the former slum squads are still operating from basements, blocks of flats and parks, we need to set up special squads to fight them, for the safety of the residents and the city."

 POZ_nationalisation_of_bikes_desc:0 "In order to strengthen our army, we are being forced to introduce an act to nationalise all private bicycles in East Poznan. As bicycles have been a very popular means of transport in our city for many years, this will strengthen our army through a large number of bicycles, which can then be used as a means of transport or by creating special bicycle divisions."

Through our actions, we managed to create our small but sufficient army, capable of restoring democracy locally. Thanks to our actions, we have managed to restore the inhabitants' faith in democracy, freedom and President Jaskowiak, which has diminished in recent years. So we should not remain on our laurels, and prepare for our next step - to take back western Poznan from the power of Jehovah's crazies"
