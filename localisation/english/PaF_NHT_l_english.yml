unification.137.t: "[GetNewspaper]Nowa Huta unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.137.desc: "Through the destruction and disorder it brought upon the population, the Fall has forced the most bitter of rivals to huddle together to survive the carnage. Perhaps no government exemplifies this phenomenon better than the Triumvirate of Nowa Huta – a loose confederation of hooligans belonging to Kraków’s main clubs. And though normally these ultras would be at each others’ throats, they found no other choice but to work together, eventually managing to unify Lesser Poland through sheer brutality. The people of Lesser Poland still find themselves reeling in shock at the sight of their new masters, as instead of order, lawlessness reigns, with raving bands of hooligans terrorizing the population, taking anything they please from the defenseless citizens. Yet, as old grudges reemerge, leading to increased tension and clashes between the teams, the stability of the Triumvirate remains in question, as with each passing day it grows closer to splintering. Perhaps one day it shall only be remembered as a temporary nightmare."
unification.137.a: "Allies of convenience don't make for the strongest of partnerships"

super.137.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.137.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.137.a: "United at last."
