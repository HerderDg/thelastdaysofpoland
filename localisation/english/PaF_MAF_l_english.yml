unification.112.t: "[GetNewspaper]Junktown unifies Capital District!"
unification.112.desc: "Lead pipes as melee weapons sharpened rods used for fortification, and metal sheet armor. In every other civil war, Junktown of Pruszków would be wiped out from the face of the Earth. However, in post-Fall Poland with ill-equipped military remnants and barely any guns for civilian use, their non-standard approach is needed to succeed. Junk Collectors' ingenuity and respect for even the tiniest scrap let them adapt quickly to the conditions of warfare in a disarmed nation. With those advantages, Janusz Pawłowski used the popularity he gained from \"Złomowisko\" reality TV to clear Pruszków from mobsters to adhering to the legacy of the infamous Pruszków Gang. After he dealt with internal matters, he and his followers ventured into the heart of Warsaw, conquering it. It remains to be seen if their armament doctrine will allow them to compete against the more advanced enemies in the coming decade."
unification.112.a: "\"Don't be a punk, collet some junk\""

super.112.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
