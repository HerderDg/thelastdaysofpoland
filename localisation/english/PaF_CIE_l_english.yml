POLITICS_ADAM_MALYSZ_DESC:0 "Adam Małysz was a national hero. And then the nation as a united monolith ceased to exist, divided by a wall. He returned to his hometown, Wisła, wishing to survive the coming storm in peace. However, he quickly gave up on retirement because there was an opportunity to save his own neighborhood from a fire that was quickly consuming the whole country. Małysz joined the newly formed Council of the Provisional Government of the Podbeskidzie Republic as one of the advisors and social representatives. He had hoped that even if only to a small extent, he could contribute to the survival of democracy in Poland. The peace, however, did not last forever as the president of the Republic of Podbeskidzie, Jerzy Buzek, fell ill and died in office. The Council was plunged into chaos, and the Golec brothers unexpectedly took power, forcibly entering the town hall in Bielsko-Biała and together with the local law enforcement forces decided to arrest all other members of the Council. Małysz managed to escape only because the guard was a huge fan of his, which convinced him to let Małysz go. Adam rushed first to Wisła, and then to Cieszyn, warning everyone about the coup d'état. The Golec brothers, learning about this betrayal, broke at least one trombone and two trumpets. Now the drums of war are growing louder and louder at the borders of Cieszyn County. The only consolation is that trucks with humanitarian aid coming across the Czech border. However, is it enough for the last proponent of freedom  in the region to emerge victorious?"

unification.38.desc:0 "Even after all that’s happened, eagles soar into the sky. In a place dominated by the mad, the power-hungry, the cruel, Adam Małysz, who gained national acclaim during his extremely successful ski jumping career, gathered a following that ended up ruling Silesian voivodeship from Cieszyn. On the remnants of the westernmost EU vassals, he leads a moderate democratic republic, poised to restore the country to European democracy. Yet from the depths of the new statelet, rumors surface of greater ambitions still. In place of the ski-jumping boards where once Małysz  won his medals, even gold, rumors of mysterious launching pads surface. Some comment that Małysz is laying the groundwork for his very own space program, hopeful he, a former sportsman, can bring the nation from the bring and into the stars, even though their expertise on the subject is, quote “over 400 hours in Kerbal Space Program”."
