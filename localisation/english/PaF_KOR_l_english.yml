unification.92.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Free Corsairs unify Pomerelia!"
unification.92.desc: "Shocking news emerge from Pomerelia, where collaborationist rule has at last been fully toppled. While this in itself is no surprise, as the German-aligned forces faced much disdain from the local population, nearly nobody could predict who the disaffected Poles would end up rallying behind. In the end, it’s not a representative of any of the major political movements that took power in the region, but the so-called “Red Corsair” - Sławomir Ziembiński, known before the fall mainly for harassing tourists within Gdańsk, yet growing into a major resistance symbol following the invasion. When the chance finally came to topple the government of the Freistadt, he seized the momentum and led his followers on a grand adventure across the voivodeship, culminating in its’ eventual seizure. A bizarre state now emerges, an enigma to many, as few know what truly lies in the mind of the Red Corsair. "
