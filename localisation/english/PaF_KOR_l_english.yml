unification.92.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Free Corsairs unify Pomerelia!"
unification.92.desc: "Gdańsk no longer belongs to Poland. The Free Corsairs have seized the coastline. From the battered shipyards of Gdynia to the fishing docks of Hel, Pomerelia now answers to the so-called Red Corsair - Sławomir Ziembiński, a fringe nationalist turned sea-bound warlord.\nClad in naval coats and surrounded by his Marine Rifle Squads, Ziembiński broadcasts bombastic speeches about “righteous lootin’”, “sending landlubbers back to Warsaw.” and “reclaiming the coast for the true sons of the sea.”\nHis men salute with sabres, commandeer fishing vessels as gunboats, and enforce a chaotic maritime law of their own making. Rumors swirl of seized cargo, raided yachts, and impounded foreign trawlers flying the wrong colors. Trade in the Gdańsk Bay is choking under fear of what Ziembiński calls “corsair taxes.” The world may call him a warlord - but in Pomerelia, he sails as admiral, patriot, and pirate king all in one."
unification.92.a: "A pirate's life for me"

super.92.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.92.a: "United at last."
