unification.189.t: "[GetNewspaper]Bishopric of Warmia Unifies Warmia and Masuria!"
unification.189.desc: "In a momentous act of faith and unity, the Bishopric of Warmia has extended its spiritual and administrative guidance over the entire Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. With the Lord's blessing, the region now stands as a beacon of religious tradition, coupled with the age-old aesthetic of well-maintained Gothic architecture. \n\nA grand ceremony in Olsztyn, modeled after the enthronements from the Bishopric's golden days and attended by high-ranking clergy, nobles, and devoted citizens, marked the official unification. Bells rang across the land as the bishop’s decree affirmed a future rooted in spiritual harmony, where holy sites will be safeguarded and appropriately venerated. All across the tranquil region, the bishopric pledges to uphold peace and ensure that pilgrimages remain safe for all who seek enlightenment and refuge. Having established a semblance of stability, the state now turns inwards, its people finally enjoying a chance at a moment of deserved respite."
unification.189.a: "For the faith and the earth!"
