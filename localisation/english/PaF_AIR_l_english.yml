unification.212.t: "[GetNewspaper]Radomskie united by Lotnicy!"
unification.212.desc: "Air over Poland has been empty and quiet, following the fall. Flight connections have gone quiet nearly overnight as the Polish government collapsed and made way to European intervention. Now, however, skies over central-east Poland have been dominated by the Radom-based warring state that emerged from the ranks of the 42nd Airforce Training Base. Air superiority attained by the squadrons of Radom's pilots allowed the military junta to dominate their local territories and defeat neighbouring warlords. Now the 42nd looks outwards, to spread their wings over new skies and new horizons. As their control above clouds increases, their need for land based facilities is sure to grow and bring recently neglected Polish aerospace industries back into gear. Only future will tell if Radom's eagles will soar high and proud, or fall to the ground gracelessly, brought down by their enemies."
unification.212.a: "Skies over Poland buzz once more."


super.212.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.212.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.212.a: "United at last."
