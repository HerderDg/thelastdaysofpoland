unification.140.t: "[GetNewspaper]Duchy of Oświęcim unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.140.desc: "Even though the collapse of Ziobro’s domain seemed to herald a similar end for his southern marches, it appears that one of the remaining rump states, namely the newly proclaimed duchy of Oświęcim, managed to successfully stand in the face of destiny, not only defending its heartlands but also subjugating the previously shattered Lesser Poland. Shorn off her mentor’s protection, Beata Szydło has truly returned, intent on finally imprinting her name on the country after years of suppression by the party apparatus. For the first time in centuries, a monarch reigns from the grand halls of Wawel, and yet, it is not an esteemed member of a historic royal family that holds the throne, but rather an upstart commoner, unrecognized beyond her state’s meager borders.

unification.140.a: "Heavy is the head that wears the crown"

super.140.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.140.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished.

Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
