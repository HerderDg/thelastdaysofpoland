unification.89.t: "[GetNewspaper]Hanseatic Republic of Hel unifies Pomerelia!"
unification.89.desc: "The jewel of the Polish north - Pomerelia, has broken free from the German leash. The man responsible for this titanic feat is none other than Artur Dziambor, together with his loyal forces of the Hanseatic Republic of Hel. Founded as nothing but a minor guerilla group attempting to liberate the region from occupation, they rapidly seized upon the collapse of the Eurokommissariats and the Kashubian Freistaat to establish a fully-fledged state. Striving to create a free market libertarian utopia, Dziambor has promised to slowly cut unnecessary branches of power in order to create a truly capitalist state. This vision has attracted numerous volunteers from around the region, tired of the German forces' overly bureaucratic approach, who have carried the movement all the way to the full liberation of the voivodeship. Old institutions are now being dismantled all over Pomerelia as what remains of the state transforms itself to finally achieve its founding principles."
unification.89.a: "Free from regulation, free from tyranny."
