 ##Events##
unification.80.t: "[GetNewspaper]Church of Toruń unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.80.desc: "At noon today, at a lavish unveiling, statues were raised in each major Kuyavian city. They all depict one man – the great warrior of the catholic faith, the Lord's chosen conqueror, the protector of Poland. Emerging victorious from the brutal struggle of the Toruń anarchy on the backs of his thoroughly devout followers, Father Rydzyk spread the pious teachings of Radio Maryja across the entire voivodeship. With a growing hoard of financial contributions from even the most destitute among the faithful, his state boasts resources most warlords could hardly dream of. From his evergrowing complex, his leadership undisputed, the aging priest now drafts plans to extend his influence to the furthest corners of the nation. Yet beyond this ascendance, keen-eyed watchers have spotted a significant change - a sickly, pale appearance and a drastic reduction of public events. If the speculations prove true, and the Father Director's days may soon near their end, will the empire he built survive without his guidance?"
unification.80.a: "Ave Maria, gratia plena... "

unificationreg.80.t: "[GetNewspaper]Rydzyk's forces sack Poznań!"
unificationreg.80.desc: "While the Fall disconnected many from the outside world, at times setting Poland to the pre-industrial age, the radio infrastructure stands undisrupted. Today, all stations within Greater Kuyavia transmitted a single message in unison - one that spoke of God's glory and His triumph over the region's heathen warlords. Indeed, Father Rydzyk's forces crushed their regional opposition, vastly increasing the priest's power, but more importantly – wealth. Following Poznan's fall, the city was heavily looted, with everything of value hauled back to the cleric's ever-growing complex, yet even this wouldn't prevent another fund-raising drive from among Toruń's vulnerable faithful, as Rydzyk seems intent to milk them of all remaining worldly possessions. And though outside his immediate zone of control the priest's influence remains limited, the state's rhetoric and service not to the ideals of God, but rather Mammon, has already sown the seed of schism, with the Vatican authorities following further developments with bated breath."
unificationreg.80.a: "A Church ruled by sin"

unificationsupreg.80.t: "[GetNewspaper]Redemptorist Church of Kuyavia subjugates Western Poland!"
unificationsupreg.80.desc: "The vision of a clergy-ruled Poland looms ever closer, as following successful campaigns to both the north and south of his Kuyavian heartlands, Tadeusz Rydzyk stands at the cusp of extending his realm over the entire country. Much to the chagrin of external observers and mainstream Church authorities alike, the priest's control continues to grow off the backs of his supporters' contributions, with the army of faithful crusaders, supposedly blessed by the heavens and funded by the cleric's vast hoards of wealth, growing to rival even those of some EU nations. As Rydzyk's influence increases, so too do his expressions of decadence, as reports indicate that his Toruń headquarters have since been turned into a den of greed and depravity. Yet with these actions deeply hidden from the public, Western Poland's false messiah prepares for the final showdown for the soul of the country."
unificationsupreg.80.a: "Mary wept from the heavens"

super.80.t: "[GetNewspaper]Birth of a new covenant!"
super.80.desc: "After a decade of conflict, Poland at last finds itself whole, unified by the same man who once influenced it from the shadows. While Father Rydzyk's state portrays itself as a theocracy, it would be a misnomer to refer to it as such, as the government operates far more akin to a megacorporation, paying lip service to religious values, while in truth it serves as little more than a money funnel for its founder and patron. With the nation under his thumb, Rydzyk can finally sit back and reap the benefits of his victory, enjoying all of life's carnal pleasures, surrounded by splendor fit only for someone of his grand stature. Yet as he grows increasingly more infirm with age, it appears that the priest's time on earth is rapidly drawing to a close. Soon, he shall be judged in front of his creator, and no amount of wealth, nor the carefully maintained illusion of faith, will be enough to save him then."
super.80.a: "The false prophet nears his Judgement Day"


unification.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Kujawja Academic Corporation unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.150.desc: "The guard has changed in Toruń, as the church rules no more. Following shocking and disgusting revelations of Rydzyk's debauchery, his support dwindled and a formerly-allied faction overthrew him. Sławomir Mentzen, leader of one of the four main branches of the Confederation and official successor to the controversial Janusz Korwin-Mikke refused to rest on his laurels and took the already significant forces of Toruń on a grand campaign, culminating in the total conquest of the voivodeship. A staunch believer in free-market policies, Mentzen aims to foster a new culture of business and entrepreneurship in Kuyavia. While his critics point to increasing exploitation of the populace by the empowered companies, the leader tosses those worries aside in pursuit of economic growth. With the war-torn region already suffering from high rates of poverty, it remains to be seen whether Mentzen's plan will be just what's needed to put it back on its' feet."
unification.150.a: "The suffering of many, the prosperity of the few"

unificationreg.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Mentzen's forces conquer Poznań"
unificationreg.150.desc: "Though the Polish state remains shattered, the nation's defiant spirit once more proves itself true, as the various warlords continue on the long path towards reunification despite all the difficulties thrown against them. A major step towards this goal has recently occurred in Kuyavia, as Sławomir Mentzen's corporate forces return to Toruń in glory following the conquest of Poznań. It appears the state's unquestioned trust in the free market has borne fruit, with the unchecked expansion of private enterprise bringing forth an economic boom – one greatly celebrated by the government's ever-swelling group of entrepreneurial supporters. Yet, beneath the façade of prosperity, reports indicate a spike in income inequality so severe, it risks rendering the majority of the population fully servile to the capitalist caste, especially as the state turns as far away as possible from the principles of modern governance, instead structuring the government far more akin to a corporate board of directors."
unificationreg.150.a: "The poor just need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps"

unificationsupreg.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Western Poland in the Conglomerate's grasp"
unificationsupreg.150.desc: "It seems money truly does rule this world, as through the power of ruthless capitalism, Mentzen's corporate state has exploited its way to holding half of Poland, all while miraculously growing its legitimacy, economy, and most importantly for the shareholders' demands, exponentially increasing its stock value. Following the conglomerate's CEO's heavy pro-business leanings, the nation is being actively reshaped, with the Fall serving as the world's greatest testing grounds for the trickle-down economic theory, enabling a state built upon a single motto: progress and profit at all costs. And though initially, this approach has done wonders for the statelet's industrial capability, it turns out even freedom is a paid commodity – one that the largest businesses are already buying out for themselves. As the little man's liberty is being progressively curtailed by corporate might, Mentzen happily sits back and enjoys the benefits of their greed."
unificationsupreg.150.a: "An entrepreneur's dream is a common man's nightmare"

super.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Acquisition of Poland complete"
super.150.desc: "Despite nationwide resistance and desperate defense by the remaining warlord factions, Poland has been reborn – unified by a ruthless Conglomerate, one that puts the profits of its shareholders above the population's wellbeing. And yet, every single concern about the state's governance – the worker's rights abuses, the alleged war crimes committed in the struggle for reunification, and the replacement of democratic institutions by an all-powerful business council, has been wiped away by a revelation so shocking, so unfathomable, that it shatters the very concept of reality. It appears somehow, the country's leader - Sławomir Mentzen, has been replaced by a seemingly sentient form of artificial intelligence – an android. Though theories about the technology's significance and the identity of those behind it multiply, the truth remains shrouded from the common folk, known only to the Conglomerate's utmost elite. One thing remains certain, however. The meaning of humanity has changed, and so has life, at least for the chosen few."
super.150.a: "Singularity has been achieved"

#unification.151.t: "[GetNewspaper]Shooters' Brigade 1909 unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
#unification.151.desc: "The revealing of Rydzyk's transgressions against the laws of both God and Man was a grave shock for the people of Toruń. Almost immediately, schemes began to form, aiming to depose him once and for all. Disaffected and disgusted by the Father Director's true character, paramilitaries of the 1909 Shooters' Brigade under Adam Ślusarski were the first to act, as a bloody coup and repressions against Rydzyk's clique followed. Since then, Toruń has been transformed into a true military machine, churning out guns and equipment for the army. Thanks to those preparations, the warlord quickly gained the upper hand in the wars of regional unification, as city after city fell under their onslaught. Mandatory conscription has been issued for all eligible citizens as the army fills its ranks in preparation for another conquest."
