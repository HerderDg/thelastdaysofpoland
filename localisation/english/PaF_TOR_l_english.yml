Even if our success at restoring order to Toruń has been tremendous, there is still one final frontier, one more fortress we must burst apart the walls of, like Joshua at Jericho! What once used to be our main broadcasting center is now corrupted and twisted by Judeo-Bolshevik sin! The workers there now busy themselves with undermining the Christian truth, with destroying what is holy and good within the world! This will not stand, my brothers and sisters! It is time to retake what is truly ours, to reclaim our Promised Land from the pagan menace! Let us then pray for the soldiers who shall preform this great deed... We fly to Thy protection, O Holy Mother of God..."

TOR_accept_maryja_guidance_desc: "Oh, dear listeners. Let this day be a day of rememberance towards the greatness of our great Queen, the Virgin Mary. Her former throne may lay fractured in Poland's demise, but that will never mean she will cease to be our great patron. She gave birth to our saviour, gracefully accepting God's gift upon her and leading to the salvation of the whole Earth with it. Why this specific day? Well, such is because of a proclamation by Blessed Father Rydzyk: that Virgin Mary shall be our nation's great patron on the road to the rallying of all Polish christians under our banner. I urge all of you to celebrate this great occasion the best you can."
TOR_banish_the_vices_desc: ""
TOR_burden_of_our_sins_desc: "As God speaks through the Book of Amos: 'For I know your many crimes and the enormity of your sins!' \nKnow this: the burden of your sins truly grieves and afflicts our Lord. No transgression ever escapes the eye of God — therefore, pray for forgiveness. \nChristian brethren! Not all is lost! \nThe foundation of faith is repentance for unworthy deeds.Yet when a holy priest humbly asks for a small offering in service of our community, you turn your backs. You forget the priests, you spit in their faces, and still they pray for you — asking only for a token of alms. \nRepent, while there is still time! \nOtherwise, the tears of Jesus shall overflow the cup of bitterness, and once more it shall be poured out upon the world—washing away iniquity, and with it, the defiant."
TOR_even_the_holy_desc: "Praised be Jesus Christ!\n Dear Christian brothers, do not forget the sacred role of our priests in their service to God. Consecrated through the holy sacrament, they are exalted in the eyes of the one and only Creator. It is the best among us—the most devout—who enter the priesthood. I assure you, they are humble, diligent, and pure in conscience, with the sole purpose of serving God.\n Yet, humans tainted by original sin—this includes even the clergy—may at times fall into corruption. To quote the Blessed Father Director: 'Yes, the priest has sinned—he has. But who has no temptations?'—thus defending the unjustly accused martyr, Bishop Edward Janiak. Show understanding for moments of weakness—for they remain nearly invisible within the stream of goodness that your priests, almost always, share with you."
TOR_gone_for_a_price_desc: "But believe me, listeners, not all hope is lost! As we know, God is gracious, and he will forgive us our sins! However, relief from the greatest of sins is not to be found within the, often difficult and strange, world of the confessional. Instead, we have devised a new idea: mass where, just by your very presence at such, your sins will be forgiven! Entry is paid, but we should consider paying that tithe an act of self-sacrifice and worship. The funds only go to good causes, after all."
TOR_pardon_disgraced_desc: "Praised be the Most Holy Virgin Mary!\n 'Let he who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone', says Jesus Christ to us. Devout brothers, take this teaching straight into your hearts, for it has been given to us for our salvation. Remember! Before you judge your neighbor, first examine your own conscience. Do not hurl words of hatred when a priest strays upon his spiritual path—for to err is human.\n As the Bible again reminds us: 'The Lord examines both the righteous and the wicked; His soul hates the one who loves violence.' Therefore, do not spread hatred, for that is not the path of a good Christian. True mercy is shown by the one who supports our Blessed Father Director and, when the time comes—by the words of Christ—forgives sins not seven, but seventy-seven times."
TOR_new_code_of_virtue_desc: "Beloved brothers! The rule of tyrants and hypocrites has numbed ordinary citizens into depravity and passivity in the face of sin. Their time has come to an end! Through the intercession of the Glorified Father Director, God shall once again descend into the hearts of His people, reclaiming the place that is rightfully His. A new legal code shall be established, founded upon the Holy Scriptures. \n We vow that it will be nothing but a reflection of the order and Christian fellowship spoken of in the Bible. Yet do not be afraid! For God speaks to you: \n 'The law of the Lord is perfect, it revives the soul; \n the testimony of the Lord is trustworthy, it gives wisdom to the simple. \n The precepts of the Lord are right, they bring joy to the heart; \n the commandment of the Lord is radiant, it enlightens the eyes.'"
TOR_collection_plate_economy_desc: "Good day and God bless to all listeners! We receive many letters thanking Father Director for his lax tax policy as the supervisor of his flock. We are, however, saddened that many of you interpreted Father Tadeusz's charity as a permission to harden your hearts. Indeed, we are disappointed by the meager amount of donations to the state, despite the low tax rates. We could raise them to prevent you from going down the dangerous path of money hoarders. Yet, Father Tadeusz remembers the great importance of Free Will on the road to salvation. That is why the Radio Maryja editorial office only calls for increased voluntary contributions, at least for the time being."
TOR_safe_under_cassocks_desc: "Brothers and sisters, you heard about the sin of gossip. Of slinging mud upon your neighbor, coveting attention or vengeance. Of speaking baseless testimony against one another.\nTake heed, for it's not only you or your neighbor who may be slandered: Our holy Church, its shepherds, indeed the Glorified Father Director himself, are under attack by the misguided without end. Always they're accused of the worst sins on the planet. Always those of rotten tounges will seek to convince you that our holiest of churches are dens of vice, or our shepherds are most offensive heretics since Nestorius. \n Report the lies, combat the calumny, refute the reckless claims, but above all, disrupt not the sacristies and administrative spaces of our Church. Our holy work is done tirelessly for you, dear Toruń, andto disrupt it is to disrupt our very way of life."
TOR_loyalty_through_sin_desc: "Good evening, listeners. \n My apologies for disrupting your prayers, or interfering with prior sermons. It's unfortunate that the affair bringing me here tonight is a troubling one. I am here because friar Sebastian Krzyż, a priest of our Church, broke the laws that bind our society and ecclesiarchy together. Embezzlement of tithes, excessive money laundering, and a most henious of sodomite prostitution rings our investigators ever saw, were all connected to him. It pains me to announce this event, as up until now, even during his dissent against our views on indulgences, he was considered an esteemed member of our Church. \n In unrelated news, the representant of Lew Beria, accused of the same crimes, filed a motion to dismiss the case based on lack of evidence and possible prosecutorial misconduct. Verdict will be read the next Monday. Thank you for your attention, and know I am no more adjudicator than I am a servant of the Lord and Our Father Director. Let tonight remind us, that we must adhere to the codes that bind our Church. Lest we endanger all of our faithful."
TOR_expanding_complex_desc: "Listeners,\nWhen Sodom's sins marked it for death, even then Abraham bargained with God, whether he'll sweep away the righteous with the wicked. And thus God promised, if ten righteous people can be found, it will be spared.\nBut lo and behold the office spaces and summer homes to the west of our strongholds: Know this listeners, there's not a single righteous person inhabiting those places. Indeed, we are told there's not a single person there, period. Like Sodom, let our bulldozers and brimstone too if need be consume those decrepit sinful structures, so that new holier structures can be made for holier purposes. As our loving Church grows, the space for its work and love will grow too."
TOR_away_from_prying_eyes_desc: "Take heed, dear listeners. Take heed and listen closely. \n To ensure undisturbed continuation of our work, and to advance stricture and prorpiety to our spaces, access to spaces for our leadership and administration will be strictly regulated. Fences will be set up around our sites and structures. Restricted areas will be strictly guarded. No ignorance nor meekness will be an excuse for trespassing, and no donation will wash away the sin of disobedience, only sweat of your brow. \n Guard the privacy of our grounds with your deeds and reports alike, and God will look as kindly upon you as He looks upon your priesthood."
TOR_woe_to_corrupters_desc: "Glory to Christ!\n Most of us still remember the dreadful times of unrest and war in our beloved Toruń. God puts us through difficult trials, testing our devotion to the faith, just as He once tested the Biblical Job. Fear not—you shall receive your reward in the Kingdom of Heaven for your suffering. \n Yet the enemy has been driven away, not defeated. Beware of him! For as the Holy Scripture says:\n 'A man that is a heretic after the first and second admonition reject;\nKnowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.'\n Keep your eyes wide open! Among you have crept the ungodly! Everyone who sows scandal, who speaks against the Lord with a deceitful tongue, and all other sinners shall not escape Divine Judgment.\n Report heretics to the authorities!"

TOR_eyes_in_every_window_desc: ""
TOR_install_offering_terminals_desc: "The unfaithful often accuse the Church of obscurantism. Their arguments show that those who criticize our holy institution the most are those who attend the Masses the least and therefore have no idea what they're talking about. Anyone who stepped into any of the Torunian churches can see clear signs of modernization: new heating, stronger lighting, and, of course, automated offering terminals. Those new devices were made for those who prefer digital financial transfers or don't want to bother hard-working plate-bearing priests. One could say, the Church goes too far with the digitalization of our services, given the number of seniors who attend the Church. For all faithful confused with the new technology, I recommend the terminals' manual that can be found in the newest issue of 'Our Journal'."
TOR_sowing_the_grains_desc: "In true monastic fashion, Father Tadeusz promised to use the money he gathered from donations to make numerous investments that would improve the livelihood of the faithful. In the coming days, you can expect new schools, roads, and investments dedicated to providing you with workplaces. To take care of the children, whose parents will finally gain an employment opportunity, new schools and kindergartens will be set up with educated, caring, and pious teachers and caretakers.\nSincere thanks to all those generous souls who enabled Father Director to do those good deeds. You are the example to those with hardened hearts, whose redemption we shall await."
TOR_alms_for_needy_desc: "In the coming days, a great fundraising campaign will take place. Lux Veritatis foundation will gather money for the food, clothes, and sanitary items through the hands of charity workers. The campaign will help to speed up the process of elevating the faithful from poverty, so we wouldn't have to wait for the inevitable, albeit gradual, rise in living quality resulting from Father Rydzyk's wise investments.\nSome are concerned that the Lux Veritatis foundation, managed by Father Taduesz himself, is responsible for the charity, as that could lead to corruption, but it is nonsense. Only the Father Director's oversight can prevent the money from going into the pockets of shady, greedy frauds from some unverified, probably foreign organization."
TOR_mountain_of_gold_desc: "The venomous slander continues! The militant atheists attack the church for seemingly defrauding the believers of money. Again, the loudest voices belong to those who are last to offer any kind of donation to the holy cause, preferring instead to indulge in their instinct of wastrels. On the contrary, the donors are happy with the way the Church and Lux Veritatis spend the offered money, as stated by their letters. But that's besides the point. Our fundraising has never had any stated purpose, and the faithful knew it when they made donations. If the money is the Father Director's to dispose of, how can he then commit defraudation? It's just common sense."
TOR_grand_pastoral_visit_desc: "Remember that this time of the year is dedicated to additional pastoral visits. Invite priests into your homes and Jesus into your hearts. Share your worries with the priests, pray with them, let them consecrate your hearths and bless your families. If you know that your neighbor needs additional visits during a time of doubt, inform your local cleric as well and point him in the right direction. Remember, you must help them be a good shepherd, and it doesn't matter if you've accepted them during the regular visit time between Christmas and the Holiday of Presentation of Jesus. \nIt goes without saying that for their needed task, rewarding them in some form is a matter of good manners."
TOR_amplifying_our_signal_desc: "Even though our main home is the beautiful city of Toruń, we must not ignore that, before the fall, all of Poland's most pious used to listen to us! We hope to someday restore this beautiful state, and to do so, we must start small. Tomorrow, Radio Maryja will be unavailible. However, after the necessary technical upgrades are complete, expect our broadcasts to be louder, clearer, and farther-reaching than before. We hope to reach out to as many people as possible, so that they may experience the joy of belief with us! Hail Mary!"
TOR_round_of_phone_ins_desc: "Listeners! We, as a radio station, are quite known for one specific thing: our call-in segments, when our listeners have the chance to get in touch with the hosts, speaking their mind and asking the questions they want to hear awnsered. We are glad to report that, in the coming days, these segments will begin their revival. We understand not many people in Toruń have phone reception as of now, and that lines to phone boots will be more crowded than ever. However, remember that our listeners don't come from only Toruń. Quite the contrary. And getting to hear the voices of people outside of our lovely city will perhaps broaden our horizons on the state of the surrounding states."
TOR_fostering_the_flock_desc: "Dear listeners! As we reach farther and farther in our process of revival, we must emphasize above all: we are an OPEN family, ready to accept new members at all times. Do not close your hearts before the sinful, as even they deserve a chance at redemption by self-sacrifice. The Blessed Father has proclaimed a series of events and meet-and-greets among the populace in order to further drive this point home. We dearly hope to see you there, God Bless!"
TOR_human_side_desc: "Dear listeners. Although we have faced scandal after scandal, defamation after defamation and entire walls of libel thrown against our station and its founder, we cannot deny: the Blessed Father is a person who is easy to like. His piosness attracts us all to listen to these broadcasts every day, but can it be said that the man lacks charisma? He has decided it is now time to make more public appearances, in order to destroy this libelous slander against us and show the public a side of the founder they have not seen in a while: his human side."
TOR_keeping_it_in_family_desc: "Dear brothers! Though the situation in the country remains dire, we are starting to see our family reform. People flock from even beyond our borders to listen to our broadcasts, even despite the Polish church's chaos. The greatest family of all, the family of virtue, is healing and growing! And even our old members remain loyal and ready to spread the word! We have emerged victorious from this struggle against the Devil, and things will only look up from here!"
TOR_spread_the_virtue_desc: "Our current situation seems dire. We receive many calls from distressed faithful about hardship and straying away from Christian ways. This is not the first time good Christians have suffered such a fate. We remember the totalitarian persecution of the 20th century. In those daring times, seek comfort in the story of venerable Father - Tadeusz Rydzyk's life. The pagan nazi Germans killed his mother's husband, Franciszek Rydzyk, who just like Saint Joseph protected his spouse and her son. Unlike the Son of Man, Father Taduesz was denied the chance to meet the man his mother loved.\nYet he persevered, still full of faith. He survived the cruelty of the Second World War and the bloody atheistic regime of communists, who couldn't stop him from spreading the Word of Christ. Emulate his stance and together with the Family of Radio Maryja, you will be able to weather the storm that came after the Fall."
TOR_castitas_desc: "Praised be Jesus Christ and ever Virgin Mary. Today we have a very special guest. Today we'll hear the live words of Father Tadeusz Rydzyk.\n\n'Those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.'\nChastity. It is perhaps the most important vow as it not only applies to monastic orders but to the whole of the clergy. It is also because for many it is the hardest one. To forsake the possibility of having offspring... How many are able to keep such a pledge. No wonder there are some priests who fall especially in the atheistic culture of promiscuity that surrounds us.\nI urge all priests who struggle with lust to remain ever stalwart. We don't want to provoke the lustful unfaithful to hypocritically attack the clerics for their minor mishaps."
TOR_mendicans_desc: "God bless all our listeners. Today's broadcast will be hosted by Father Jan Król, who'll tell us about Catholic monstic vows. Praised be Jesus Christ and ever Virgin Mary.\n\nNow and forever. Amen. 'Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.'\nWith those words, Jesus urged us to beware of the wealth that could lead us astray if we pay it too much mind. That is why, due to caution and through monumental sacrifice, monks such as Father Tadeusz shun material possessions beyond personal belongings. It is most noble example that I personally try to embrace and urge you all to imitate as well."
TOR_obedientia_desc: "In today's broadcast that is a part of our series regarding monastic vows. Today, my guest is the minister of economy - Sławomir Mentzen and the topic of our discussion is: Obedience. Minister, what does obedience mean to you?\n\nThank you for your invitation. Obedience is to me a key factor of a well-functioning society. I demand obedience from my children and similarly expect them from my workers, although in different form of course. In turn, I and all of the citizens are obedient to the legitimate authority of the state. We all should regard our superiors for their intelligence and competence. They serve as an example for us to do better. They're not unjust tyrants, who should be despised as the left would have you believe."

TOR_extending_our_protection_desc: "Greetings, listeners. Today, I would like to begin with a reiteration of what we all already know: the people currently under Całbecki's heel are, as the old song goes, opressed so hard they cannot stand! This is preposterous! These people are begging to be able to worship the True God and waiting until the day they will be freed by the Mosesian hand of Rydzyk. Nevermind the fact we have investments in the region, which Całbecki has decided to kidnap from us! We are only doing what is needed, no, what has been inevitable. Ave Maria, my brothers."
TOR_restore_the_resting_place_desc: "Today, we shall remember the legacy of Jerzy Popiełuszko. The Solidarność chaplain, murdered by the UB, is truly a martyr of our times!

We shall take him as one of our many patrons on the road to regional unification. After all, he is nothing if not commendable, and our actions align with what he would've wanted quite well. God bless us! Blessed Jerzy Popiełuszko, pray for us!"

The cause of his death is known to us all: the poisonous viper of communism! Every one of us must make sure that communism is not welcome within our territory! From now on, we will make sure that no red thought slips in, no red thought forms, and that none slips out. The hammer and sickle must be destroyed if our existance is to be guaranteed."

While it is nothing compared to what Adamczak once commanded during the pre-planned staged defense of our western border, it will surely boost our strength enough to take on future threats.

unification.80.t: "[GetNewspaper]Church of Toruń unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.80.desc: "At noon today, at a lavish unveiling, statues were raised in each major Kuyavian city. They all depict one man – the great warrior of the catholic faith, the Lord's chosen conqueror, the protector of Poland. Emerging victorious from the brutal struggle of the Toruń anarchy on the backs of his thoroughly devout followers, Father Rydzyk spread the pious teachings of Radio Maryja across the entire voivodeship. With a growing hoard of financial contributions from even the most destitute among the faithful, his state boasts resources most warlords could hardly dream of. From his evergrowing complex, his leadership undisputed, the aging priest now drafts plans to extend his influence to the furthest corners of the nation. Yet beyond this ascendance, keen-eyed watchers have spotted a significant change - a sickly, pale appearance and a drastic reduction of public events. If the speculations prove true, and the Father Director's days may soon near their end, will the empire he built survive without his guidance?"
unification.80.a: "Ave Maria, gratia plena... "

unificationreg.80.t: "[GetNewspaper]Rydzyk's forces sack Poznań!"
unificationreg.80.desc: "While the Fall disconnected many from the outside world, at times setting Poland to the pre-industrial age, the radio infrastructure stands undisrupted. Today, all stations within Greater Kuyavia transmitted a single message in unison - one that spoke of God's glory and His triumph over the region's heathen warlords. Indeed, Father Rydzyk's forces crushed their regional opposition, vastly increasing the priest's power, but more importantly – wealth. Following Poznan's fall, the city was heavily looted, with everything of value hauled back to the cleric's ever-growing complex, yet even this wouldn't prevent another fund-raising drive from among Toruń's vulnerable faithful, as Rydzyk seems intent to milk them of all remaining worldly possessions. And though outside his immediate zone of control the priest's influence remains limited, the state's rhetoric and service not to the ideals of God, but rather Mammon, has already sown the seed of schism, with the Vatican authorities following further developments with bated breath."
unificationreg.80.a: "A Church ruled by sin"

unificationsupreg.80.t: "[GetNewspaper]Redemptorist Church of Kuyavia subjugates Western Poland!"
unificationsupreg.80.desc: "The vision of a clergy-ruled Poland looms ever closer, as following successful campaigns to both the north and south of his Kuyavian heartlands, Tadeusz Rydzyk stands at the cusp of extending his realm over the entire country. Much to the chagrin of external observers and mainstream Church authorities alike, the priest's control continues to grow off the backs of his supporters' contributions, with the army of faithful crusaders, supposedly blessed by the heavens and funded by the cleric's vast hoards of wealth, growing to rival even those of some EU nations. As Rydzyk's influence increases, so too do his expressions of decadence, as reports indicate that his Toruń headquarters have since been turned into a den of greed and depravity. Yet with these actions deeply hidden from the public, Western Poland's false messiah prepares for the final showdown for the soul of the country."

super.80.t: "[GetNewspaper]Birth of a new covenant!"
super.80.desc: "After a decade of conflict, Poland at last finds itself whole, unified by the same man who once influenced it from the shadows. While Father Rydzyk's state portrays itself as a theocracy, it would be a misnomer to refer to it as such, as the government operates far more akin to a megacorporation, paying lip service to religious values, while in truth it serves as little more than a money funnel for its founder and patron. With the nation under his thumb, Rydzyk can finally sit back and reap the benefits of his victory, enjoying all of life's carnal pleasures, surrounded by splendor fit only for someone of his grand stature. Yet as he grows increasingly more infirm with age, it appears that the priest's time on earth is rapidly drawing to a close. Soon, he shall be judged in front of his creator, and no amount of wealth, nor the carefully maintained illusion of faith, will be enough to save him then."
super.80.a: "The false prophet nears his Judgement Day"


unification.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Kujawja Academic Corporation unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.150.desc: "The guard has changed in Toruń, as the church rules no more. Following shocking and disgusting revelations of Rydzyk's debauchery, his support dwindled and a formerly-allied faction overthrew him. Sławomir Mentzen, leader of one of the four main branches of the Confederation and official successor to the controversial Janusz Korwin-Mikke refused to rest on his laurels and took the already significant forces of Toruń on a grand campaign, culminating in the total conquest of the voivodeship. A staunch believer in free-market policies, Mentzen aims to foster a new culture of business and entrepreneurship in Kuyavia. While his critics point to increasing exploitation of the populace by the empowered companies, the leader tosses those worries aside in pursuit of economic growth. With the war-torn region already suffering from high rates of poverty, it remains to be seen whether Mentzen's plan will be just what's needed to put it back on its' feet."
unification.150.a: "The suffering of many, the prosperity of the few"

unificationreg.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Mentzen's forces conquer Poznań"
unificationreg.150.desc: "Though the Polish state remains shattered, the nation's defiant spirit once more proves itself true, as the various warlords continue on the long path towards reunification despite all the difficulties thrown against them. A major step towards this goal has recently occurred in Kuyavia, as Sławomir Mentzen's corporate forces return to Toruń in glory following the conquest of Poznań. It appears the state's unquestioned trust in the free market has borne fruit, with the unchecked expansion of private enterprise bringing forth an economic boom – one greatly celebrated by the government's ever-swelling group of entrepreneurial supporters. Yet, beneath the façade of prosperity, reports indicate a spike in income inequality so severe, it risks rendering the majority of the population fully servile to the capitalist caste, especially as the state turns as far away as possible from the principles of modern governance, instead structuring the government far more akin to a corporate board of directors."
unificationreg.150.a: "The poor just need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps"

unificationsupreg.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Western Poland in the Conglomerate's grasp"
unificationsupreg.150.desc: "It seems money truly does rule this world, as through the power of ruthless capitalism, Mentzen's corporate state has exploited its way to holding half of Poland, all while miraculously growing its legitimacy, economy, and most importantly for the shareholders' demands, exponentially increasing its stock value. Following the conglomerate's CEO's heavy pro-business leanings, the nation is being actively reshaped, with the Fall serving as the world's greatest testing grounds for the trickle-down economic theory, enabling a state built upon a single motto: progress and profit at all costs. And though initially, this approach has done wonders for the statelet's industrial capability, it turns out even freedom is a paid commodity – one that the largest businesses are already buying out for themselves. As the little man's liberty is being progressively curtailed by corporate might, Mentzen happily sits back and enjoys the benefits of their greed."

super.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Acquisition of Poland complete"
super.150.desc: "Despite nationwide resistance and desperate defense by the remaining warlord factions, Poland has been reborn – unified by a ruthless Conglomerate, one that puts the profits of its shareholders above the population's wellbeing. And yet, every single concern about the state's governance – the worker's rights abuses, the alleged war crimes committed in the struggle for reunification, and the replacement of democratic institutions by an all-powerful business council, has been wiped away by a revelation so shocking, so unfathomable, that it shatters the very concept of reality. It appears somehow, the country's leader - Sławomir Mentzen, has been replaced by a seemingly sentient form of artificial intelligence – an android. Though theories about the technology's significance and the identity of those behind it multiply, the truth remains shrouded from the common folk, known only to the Conglomerate's utmost elite. One thing remains certain, however. The meaning of humanity has changed, and so has life, at least for the chosen few."

#unification.151.desc: "The revealing of Rydzyk's transgressions against the laws of both God and Man was a grave shock for the people of Toruń. Almost immediately, schemes began to form, aiming to depose him once and for all. Disaffected and disgusted by the Father Director's true character, paramilitaries of the 1909 Shooters' Brigade under Adam Ślusarski were the first to act, as a bloody coup and repressions against Rydzyk's clique followed. Since then, Toruń has been transformed into a true military machine, churning out guns and equipment for the army. Thanks to those preparations, the warlord quickly gained the upper hand in the wars of regional unification, as city after city fell under their onslaught. Mandatory conscription has been issued for all eligible citizens as the army fills its ranks in preparation for another conquest."

TOR.1.t: "The Last Goodbye"
TOR.1.desc: "Krystian shivered in the late winter breeze, the cold finally catching up to him as he stood in silent commemoration. The persistent downpour dampened his bloodied uniform and streaked across his still, weathered face. He welcomed it. It masked the tears. \n\n- You know, I still remember what you told me all those years ago. Back when I was still just a kid. 'Always question your authorities.' - He sighed heavily. - If only you had questioned yours... \n\nTossing the shovel aside, he planted a single makeshift cross into the ground, fighting against the wind to prevent it from immediately toppling over. As he stood back up with considerable difficulty, he continued his eulogy. \n\n- It's hard, you know... It's hard to remember you for who you were, not who you became. I always looked up to you, even though I'd never let you see it. Maybe at least in your final moments, you were able to repent. You don't deserve to be condemned. It's not your fault that you were lied to. \n\nAfter struggling to get his lighter working in the incessant rain, Krystian placed a single candle at the foot of the makeshift grave. \n\n- I'm sorry I'm the only one to come here. Maja is probably still down south with those godless witches and Father... as much as I tried, he still wasn't able to forgive you. Turning against the Church, against your own faith... it was too much for him to take in. I promised myself I'd do more to honor your memory, but even this can get me in a lot of trouble. \n\nEmotions overwhelming him, Krystian stammered as he uttered the words of the Eternal Rest, repeating the prayer pleadingly in a desperate hope that it might save the soul of the deceased. \n\n- All those years ago, you were the one to teach me these words. Never in my life would I have imagined having to say them for your sake. Not so soon. At least, thanks to Father Rydzyk, others won't have to suffer the same fate. One day, this country will be saved, and nobody else will die fighting against God's will. I'm sure, now that you've seen the truth with your own eyes, you know our cause is right. I hope that the Lord, in all his mercy, will find you deserving of another chance so that you may pray for our victory from the other side. Despite everything that happened between us, I just want you to know one thing."

TOR.2.t: "Final Words"
TOR.2.desc: "- Station 100. I repeat, this is Station 100. We are still holding against those damn zealots but their tide isn't stopping. If there are any units in the vicinity, please aid us immediately. We don't know how long we'll be able to hold. \n\nThe sound of gunfire crept ever closer. Each call for help, repeated like a mantra, echoed across the empty waves, desperately trying to reach out to those who, unknown to the station's ragtag crew, have already either fallen or been forced into hiding. \n\n- Station 100. I repeat... \n- It's no use, Grzegorz. Nobody's coming. - The senior operator burst in with a mix of disappointment and boiling anger. - Can't you see we're out here alone? \n- Well, unlike you, I'm not just going to sit here and wait for my turn to die. - He turned back to the microphone. - Station 100... \n- Mhm, sure. If you want anyone to hear you, get back on the civilian airwaves. Give these fanatics a piece of your mind while you still can. - He gave his colleague a visible smirk. - As for me, I'd rather die in peace. Try not to bother me too much while I relax, alright? \n\nWith the time running out, Stanisław adjusted the transmitter's frequency and straightened himself in his chair. With increasing volume, the noises of the battle raging below broke through the filters, and the occasional stray bullets flew unpredictably around the room. Determined to make a final impact, he addressed his enemy's indoctrinated supporters. \n\n- If you can hear me, please listen. You've been lied to. Deceived. Tadeusz Rydzyk is not the pious man he pretends to be. I know it, I know him. I worked under him. You have no idea just how much he hides from you. Please, this is not an attack against your faith. Rydzyk has none. He only serves himself. He only wants your money, your devotion. We have failed. Only you can stop him. I will be gone soon, but please, you have to find a way to..."

We have received multiple complaints that the familiar waves of the one true Christian network have been turned into a den of atheistic propaganda, lies, and depravity. Rest assured that the matter has been thoroughly resolved. \n\nA muffled voice was heard in the distance, and the priest turned away from the microphone, forgetting to properly silence it. - What do you mean he's still moving? Then just shoot him again, damn it. Why do I have to tell you how to do your job? \n\nHe poised himself and returned to the broadcast. - Ahem. From now on, we will make every effort to earn back your trust so you can once again comfortably tune in to the Catholic voice in your households. And now, as an appeal to the Lord to deliver us continued stability and help us move on from this difficult time, brothers and sisters, let us pray:"

TOR.4.t: "Pride"
TOR.4.desc: "- Ave Maria, gratia plena... \n\nA booming voice resonated around the walls of the empty sanctuary. Though normally open to visitors from all walks of life, the building had been emptied for a moment of private contemplation. \n\n-Dominus tecum... \n\nThough his turbulent life didn't often allow him an opportunity for quiet reflection, Tadeusz Rydzyk was long overdue a chance to confide with his divine patron. \n\n- Benedicta tu in mulieribus... \n\nKneeling on the cold, hard floor in front of a personally commissioned icon of the Virgin Mary, he shivered from the freezing air of an early April morning. \n\n- et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus... \n\nYet, undeterred, he persisted, continuously repeating the same prayer. \n\n- Sancta Maria, Mater Dei... \n\nThe same one that started it all, back in the aging halls of a provincial seminary. \n\n- ora pro nobis peccatoribus... \n\nThe same one that led him to power and wealth he could once seldom fathom. \n\n- nunc et in hora mortis nostrae... \n\nNow that his influence was no longer merely spiritual, he once more prayed for guidance, recognition... \n\n- Amen. \n\nFor deniability, before himself and those who revered him, that he served anyone but his own interests and vices. \n\n- Mary, I come to you in this time of great uncertainty. All my life, you have led me, and all my life, I have served you. To you, I owe everything I have built. With full gratitude, I accept your blessing to guide this country through peril; to rebirth it in the fires of faith. Just as I have accepted your mission when you first chose me, a sinner, for your greatest evangelist. And yet, you always knew perfectly that among all your devotees, only I could serve as your champion. Mary, your name resonates in the prayers of millions. It unites this city under one holy banner. Soon, under my leadership, the whole country will worship you in unison. My holy patron, it is not often I ask for anything in return for my service. I expect no reward except for the temporal. And yet, I must ask you, for all the souls I have saved, for the renewal of faith I have brought, that when the day of my judgment comes, you will look not at my personal moral failings but at the undeniable good I have brought upon this world. For Mary, I may not follow every one of your guidelines; I may live in opposition to the Commandments, but without me, we all would be condemned to an eternity of torment. For this, I know none on this Earth are more deserving of a special place in Heaven. Until then, I hope you will intercede on my behalf just as I do on yours."

TOR.5.t: "Greed"
TOR.5.desc: "Fort I, or rather, what little remained of it after the prolonged siege, provided the perfect base of operations for a lost cause. Though the writing had been on the wall for a long time, when surrender would mean death, no last stand is too hopeless. At that point, you’ll do anything to prolong your suffering for just another few days. Thus, Zaleski’s final handful of loyalists fought to the man against the fanatical tide, awakening the ghosts of the old Prussian garrison to witness yet another bout. Even now, in the crumbling tunnels of the structure, it felt as if gunfire echoed just out of reach. \n\nArtur despised the cleanup duty assigned by his superiors, perhaps even more so than his other colleagues. For the life of him, he could not understand why they were sent out every day to scour the empty pathways, but the silence, broken only by the soft tapping of water dripping down from the cracked ceilings and his rhythmic, unsteady footsteps, was enough to ensnare him in an unsettling aura. Though logically, the task was a far better posting than frontline duty, no matter how he tried, Artur just couldn’t shake the feeling that something, or someone, was about to lunge at him at any moment. With a torch in his hand and a makeshift rifle strapped over his shoulder, each portion followed a similar script. Empty. Empty. A few cobwebs. Empty. Structural collapse blocking the pathway. Empty. Crates. Empty. Hold on… crates? That was a new one. \n\nPulled out of the uneventful, yet tense, routine, Artur diligently stepped back to check on perhaps the sole somewhat interesting thing he might find all day. Tapping the containers slightly as if fearful that whatever limb makes contact might end up getting blown off, his eyes nearly dropped at the sight of a small fortune, neatly stashed up to the brim, most likely whatever funds could be smuggled out of the city treasury by the defenders. After a quick moment of disbelief, he vowed to do the only thing his values would allow - return it untouched to his spiritual patron. \n\n- Nice find, soldier. I’ll take it from here. - A hoarse voice spoke from the opening of the tunnel. \n-  Oh, Father Król. I… didn’t expect to find you here. There’s no need to burden yourself. I’ll take this directly to the Father Director. - How the priest managed to appear at the exact moment money got involved was beyond Artur’s understanding. \n- No, no. - The cleric laughed politely. - I don’t think you will. Not all of it, at least. \n- But… orders are to report any findings to Father Rydzyk… \n\nThe surprising amount of backbone displayed by the soldier irritated the priest. \n\n- I’m sure he has more than enough already. Not that he can complain. - He pouted. - Don’t you think we also deserve a little bonus? \n\nArtur looked at Król wide-eyed, astonished at the audacity. \n\n- How about this? Deliver a quarter of the money to Rydzyk. Take 5% for the trouble and silence. I expect to see the rest at my residence by tomorrow morning. Oh, and if you try to skim me for even a single grosz... well, you don't want to know what happens then. Dismissed. \n\nWithout waiting for a response, the priest headed out as abruptly as he appeared, lost in thought:"

TOR.6.desc: "- Ah, Mrs. Barska. You’re early. Good. Take a seat in the waiting area. I’ll be with you shortly. \n\nThe practiced, reassuring smile and friendly demeanor of the receptionist were always enough to melt most of Lidia's tension. After leaving her fur coat on the hanger standing in the corner of the lobby, she sat down on the padded sofa and reached for one of the mints on the coffee table in front of her. A few minutes later, the assistant joined her with a neat binder in hand. \n\n- Alright, so I know this may all seem a bit overwhelming, especially if it's your first visit, but before the... appointment, we just have to take care of the formalities. \n- Actually... I've... uhh... been here a few times already... - the woman corrected, flustered, sinking into the couch, having felt the full brunt of the shame. \n- Ah, my mistake. We’ve been getting a lot of traffic lately. I get the faces mixed up sometimes. - The monotone, overly excited pitch seemed not to react to the information. - Well, that saves us a lot of paperwork. Phew. \n- Mhm, let's just get it over with. I'm not exactly thrilled to be here, you know. \n- Certainly! - She began laying out the dozen-or-so separate documents. - So, we've got the standard: non-disclosure agreement, note of indulgence, health form... you know the drill. Oh, and by the way, they finally finished building that pharmacy by the academy. Go there once you're done, and Robert will give you all the pills you need. \n- Are you sure? - Lidia spoke frightfully. - They were pretty adamant during yesterday's mass that it would be an unforgivable sin. Murder of the innocent... \n- Look, I've cleared it with Father Rydzyk. He doesn't want any... unintended consequences of your interactions. Don't worry about it. I'm sure he has his reasons. If he says it's okay in this case, then it has to be. \n- Uh-huh... surely... - she tried to comfort herself, half-heartedly trying to accept the backward logic as she methodically signed each document. - And what is this supposed to be? \n- Ah, that's a new one! - The gleeful expression now really out of place. -  It's a list of do's and don'ts for... - She struggled momentarily to find the most diplomatic way to put it. - your... session with him today. \n- That's... a lot. Like, actually a lot. I don't know if I... \n- Yeah, I... couldn't stomach even reading through it. I imagine it feels far worse having to actually do that. - The assistant's professional attitude crumbled under the weight of human empathy. - If it's any consolation, I doubt he'll have the strength to get through most, if any, of the list. \n- Uh-huh... - Somehow, the attempt to calm her down didn't particularly help much. - For my own sake, I really hope that's the case. \n- So do I. Just umm... take your time if you need to. I'll take care of the paperwork in the meantime. - She turned away, ashamed of herself."

TOR.7.t: "Envy"
TOR.7.desc: "- Why? Why always him? - The thought stirred in Przemysław Wipler's mind as he angrily took another swig from the half-empty bottle. Bitter, overrated, just like everything associated with Mentzen. Not even his beer was different. At least it hit well enough to drown his sorrows. \n- What does he have? Clearly not the looks or any real charisma. Oh, and definitely not the politics. I AM THE ONE WITH THE ACTUAL POLITICS. - Wipler banged his fist against the side of the table. - So what, he just gets to ape the best of my ideas and twist them into a bunch of empty catchphrases? And now he's this big man, all proud on some massive stage, giving lectures to brain-dead kids who don't know any better while I sit here in this dump? I even had to thank him for it, for fuck's sake. \n\nAnticipating the unpleasant taste, Wipler steeled himself and downed about a quarter of the bottle in one go. It wasn't any better than the last gulp, nor than the three beers that came before it, but at least he was slowly getting used to it. \n\n- But no, of course, let's just let him co-run this city. Him. A guy who never truly managed anything other than that subpar law firm. He just gets to show up and take all the credit. Oh, you great beacon of piety, tell me, is it all just some cynical game to you? Surely they see it. I can't be the only one who sees it. How he shifts his beliefs so much, even I can no longer tell what his real ones are. And still, I'm just left playing follower, doing his dirty work while he and Rydzyk run this place to the ground. And what do I get for it? Instead of any recognition, a free supply of... this. \n\nFinishing the bottle, he pushed it to the side just hard enough to barely avoid it breaking before quickly reaching for the next one. \n\n- I can't keep doing this anymore. That's it. I'm out. If Mentzen wants to continue this charade, he can do that without me. Either he gives me the credit and influence I deserve, or I'm making my way back to Piekary. I don't need this. I will no longer... \n\nWipler's plans were interrupted by the familiar ringtone. Against his better judgment, he diligently answered. \n\n- Przemek, look, I'll be running late from tonight's event. Could you swing by my office and finish the agenda I started for the party's next session? \n- Uh, yeah, of course. I'll make sure to get it done. \n- Great. I really owe you one. Let me know if there’s anything I could do for you in return. \n- Actually, Sławek, do you think it would be possible to..."

TOR.8.t: "Gluttony"
TOR.8.desc: "The three of them sat by the extendable dining table, filled on all four sides with dishes large and fancy enough to sustain a whole banquet. Many of the delicacies, made with admittedly impressive finesse, were items Mentzen hadn't seen since before the Fall, making him wonder just how exactly Rydzyk was able to acquire them in the middle of a national collapse. Whatever his musings may have been, the priest seemed to give them little attention as he continued to sample bite-sized chunks from one plate after another. They sat there in silence for nearly half an hour as the Father Director feasted, making Sławomir wonder about the sheer capacity of the old man's stomach. Still, there was one thing that occupied his mind to a far greater degree. \n\n- So, would you mind telling me why exactly I've been invited? It's been a while since the last time I was here. \n- Shh, no need to worry. It's a celebration, and I want you to be a part of it. You've been a great asset to us lately. Honestly, without your help, we couldn't have achieved half of what we've done. - Rydzyk spoke with his mouth full, taking bites between every couple of words. \n- Yeah, asset... about that. I was thinking it might be time to turn our alliance into an equal partnership. \n\nThe priest nearly spat out his food in laughter, looking at Mentzen as if what he had just said was nothing but a hilarious joke. \n- I'm being serious. We account for half of the city's forces. We deserve to have a permanent seat at the table. \n- Have some humility, boy. What could you possibly know about running a whole country? It's best for all of us if you stay in your lane. \n- What could I know? I ran a party many times larger than your circle of geriatric followers. Oh, and you wouldn't have Toruń if it weren't for my assistance. \n- What the Father Director intended to say is... - Król tried to insert himself into the argument to stop the rising tensions. \n- I know very well what I intended to say. Either our current arrangement stays, or you can pack your things and go elsewhere. \n- I don't know what you're expecting, but I'm not going to just leave my city after fighting so hard to take it back... \n- Good. Keep doing what you're doing, then. You can have your rallies and beer parties while we take care of running this place. \n\nContent with having had the last word and all of his demands met, Rydzyk went back to chewing on a prime piece of rib as they once again sat in complete silence."

TOR.9.t: "Sloth"
TOR.9.desc: "The early morning sun slowly climbed to its rightful place on the still half-dark sky, peering through the curtains of an outmoded, lavishly decorated room to the accompaniment of the birds' early, enthused chirps. Feeling the warm rays on his face, Tadeusz Rydzyk turned contentedly, not bothering to open his eyes once in the process as he enjoyed one of his favorite perks of a clerical lifestyle - being able to sleep in on a weekday. Half-awake, the priest barely registered the frantic knocks at his door, forcing his visitor to eventually walk in unannounced. \n\n- Father Director! I'm terribly sorry to disturb you. I've been asked to present you with today's itinerary. All pre-checked, of course. - The fresh-faced chaplain stumbled over his words, trying to avoid the ire of his superior. - I know you specifically requested not to be woken up under any circumstances, but Father Grakowicz has requested that your homily be moved up by an additional hour. \n- Grakowicz... always some issues with him. - Rydzyk muttered incoherently. - And why does this oaf need me so early? \n- Scheduling issues, Father Director. Simply no other time his parish could host you without disturbing their regular operations. \n- Out of the question. If he's unable to hold the homily during reasonable hours, he can deliver it himself if he's so eager. \n- Should I... tell him to reschedule? \n- No. Tell him it's off. I'm not visiting that place until he learns to respect my precious time. \n- Y... yes, Father Director. As you wish. In that case, today's first item is the radio sermon at twe... \n- Send Paweł. - Rydzyk waved his hand dismissively. \n- But... Father Pakuła already had to host the Lauds at six... \n- Good, he could use some hard work for once. Keep going. What's next? \n- W... well, there's also the service at three... \n- Can't you get someone else to do it? \n- What!? It'll be right here at the Sanctuary. Please, Father Rydzyk, we're already stretched thin as is. \n- Listen. - The annoyance at being woken up against his wishes was becoming increasingly clear in the priest's voice. - Once you've lived as long as I have, you'll know not to exert yourself unless it's absolutely necessary. Now, tell me, does that apply to my presence at this service? Will anything happen if I'm not there? \n- I suppose not... - The chaplain said in defeat. He knew there was nothing to gain by arguing. - In that case, that would be all for today. Once again, I apologize for troubling you, Father Director. \n\nOvercome with relief, Rydzyk adjusted his blanket and closed his eyes once more. Too preoccupied with this task to care whether his interlocutor had left the room, he mumbled a few words in response before drifting off to sleep with a single thought on his mind - today was going to be a good day."

TOR.10.t: "Wrath"
TOR.10.desc: "The irregular clink of glass bottles resonated around the arena, converted into a makeshift pub for its first major event since the country's breakup. While the more traditionally oriented folk were busy grumbling at the hedonistic nature of the occasion, Kuyavia's new generation looked for its own kind of guidance - a booze-fuelled rant by a down-on-his-luck politician. It took considerable time to produce enough brew for the masses half-expecting not to leave the building on their own two legs, especially with the still-questionable status of external supply, but through some shrewd logistics and major loosening of industry standards, none of the participants had to wait with their mouth dry, including the event's primary speaker and organizer. Addressing the mesmerized crowd, already softened up by a number of guest panelists, Sławomir Mentzen felt like a fish back in its familiar waters. Gazing at the waves of his unwavering support, he felt powerful. Far more powerful than whatever Rydzyk could count on from his geriatric followers. He was fired up, ready to challenge for the proverbial crown he was just recently denied. Now was the time to seize it all. \n\nHe stepped up to the stage, already swaying slightly, gripping the podium for support. \n\n- Thank you. All of you. For taking back this city. - He raised the glass he was holding for a toast. - But we're not here to reminisce. There'll be a time for that. Hopefully soon. But for now, I don't know about you, but something about this victory seems especially sour. While we put our lives at risk clearing every street, every apartment from the red pestilence, some guy in a black cassock comes in and steals all the thunder. We've done most of the job. Without us, he would've been holed up in his complex by now, hiding from this or that militant. So what are the thanks we get? \n\nThe anger in his eyes was palpable, breaking through the slur in his voice. This was far more than just drunk, emotional rambling. He had a score to settle, and the people could tell, booing and laughing at every mention of Toruń's ruling High Priest. \n\n- Nothing. And you know what I have to say to him? I say, let him do his worst! We don't need him! We never did! - Even as he was swaying with every overly pronounced gesture, Mentzen maintained the open challenge. - Not for another second will we kneel before him. It's about time we became the rulers of our own domain. You hear this, 'Father Director?' Our partnership? It's over! It's war! It's... \n\nBefore he could cause any more damage to himself, a team of aides rushed him off the stage. He fought back against them, unsuccessfully. In the back of the crowd, an unassuming minister, dressed in plain clothing, turned off his recording."

TOR.11.t: "Walk of Shame"
TOR.11.desc: "The fifteen-or-so-minute walk from St. Catherine's Square to St. John's Cathedral had never felt so excruciatingly long. Every step of the way, Sławomir Mentzen could feel hundreds of piercing eyes - sneering, mocking him with revulsion. He felt as if the whole city had specifically gone out of their way to cancel whatever plans they might have otherwise had to come and shame him, which likely wasn't far from the truth, given that Rydzyk made sure to spread the word at just about every recent sermon. It didn't take much effort to realize, especially since the priest couldn't stop visibly gloating with his colleagues, that the display had little to do with forgiveness. He was to be thoroughly humiliated, to serve as an example of what happens when someone flies close enough to the sun to dare challenge the word of the infallible theocrat. \n\nThe rough penitent's clothing pricked into his skin with every step, seemingly getting worse each time he adjusted it. If there was anything Mentzen was at least partly grateful for, it's that none of the lackeys responsible for planning the event got the idea to saddle his weak back with an actual cross to bear. Though, perhaps, they simply didn't want to run the risk of anyone feeling remotely sympathetic for him. Sluggishly, he marched to the nauseating sound of poorly tuned hymns, forced to stop at every station, hang his head down in disgrace, and face the victorious clergyman, proclaiming the phrase: \n\n- Father, I have sinned against God and the Church, by His grace ordained. For the crime of conspiring against His chosen servants, I beg your forgiveness. \n\nEach time saddling himself with another exaggerated or simply made-up offense, Mentzen could clearly see the crowd get increasingly agitated with every confession. The displeased murmurs that hounded him at the start of the journey soon morphed into a furious outcry of the worst expletives the mob could utter without simultaneously condemning themselves; though it didn't take long for that line to be crossed as well. Enraged, the people crashed against the barricades, ready to enact their own version of justice that Rydzyk, in his magnanimity, seemed too lenient to enforce. Feeling the growing danger, Mentzen tried to rush the remaining part of the ceremony, pushing hurriedly through the protective cordon until he felt a harsh thud just to the side of his foot - a loose piece of cobble aimed for his head that luckily for him, barely missed the mark. Yet the assault only served as further encouragement for the frenzied crowd, which, in a near instant, began pelting the sinner with whatever materials they had on hand. Ripping the paving stones off the streets, they blindly rained the Lord's wrath upon him, knocking out numerous members of the entourage as collateral damage until an intervention by the assembled peacekeepers finally managed to disperse the gathering."

TOR.12.t: "A Conflict of Intentions"
TOR.12.desc: "Krystian excitedly made his way through the damp corridors of the seminary's living quarters. Though his arm was starting to hurt from dragging his overstuffed suitcase, filled with most of his belongings, across the entire hallway, he refused to stop for even a moment before reaching his destination. 237, his new home. For the young devotee, it was the culmination of years of preparations, the long-awaited chance to follow the religious calling he had felt since his early childhood. He turned the key, almost snapping the half-rusted base in the lock. With a noticeable creak, the door opened to reveal a modest, antiquated interior, with three beds positioned side by side to leave just enough space for a dusty wardrobe and a shared desk. His roommates were already inside, sizing Krystian up as he tossed the bag onto the considerably stained sheets and began to unpack. \n\n- As punishment or for the money? \n- Huh? What do you... \n- Not speaking clearly enough for ya? Are you here cause you got caught with something, or are you just after the cash?\n\n Krystian was taken aback. Instead of replying, he froze, staring uncomfortably at the person sitting at the opposite end of the room. \n\n- What? Ya deaf or somethin'? \n- N... no, just... I'm here to serve the Lord. Is... this some kind of joke? Like a hazing? \n- Pff, they still get those? - The other figure laughed, ignoring the question. The two exchanged glances, seemingly amused at the newcomer's answer. Well, looks like you're in for one hell of a rude awakening. \n- This… is the seminary, right? \n- You're damn right it is. And I can tell you right now that you ain't surviving more than a week with that stuck-up attitude. \n- Stuck-up? No, I... Look, I don't have to explain myself to you. You're probably not even part of it anyway. \n- That's where you're wrong, pal. We run this place. Unofficially, at least. And all fresh blood answers to us. That's right, you're looking at future Head Priest material, or better. So yeah, we could make your life a whole lot more difficult if you don't learn some respect. \n\nKrystian considered the situation for a moment before yielding to avoid making enemies on his first day, no matter how delusional he considered them. \n\n- Alright, uhh... whatever you say... \n- Now tell me, do you drink? \n- Well... only the sacramental wine. - Krystian laughed uncomfortably. \n- Uh-huh. Do you smoke? \n- N... never. \n- Do you... - He sized the newcomer up briefly. - Yeah, I'm not even gonna ask that one... \n- I'm guessing I should also say no... \n- Then genuinely what the fuck are you doing here? \n- Serving... God... Like I was supposed to... \n- Yeah, yeah, you said that already. Just don't get too attached to that. Don't get in the way, and we won't have problems. You'll drop that pious bullshit after a while here. Got it? \n- S... sure... got it..."

TOR.13.t: "The Birth of a Rebel"
TOR.13.desc: "In a small commercial area, nestled out of view just off to the side of Grudziądzka, a key clicked familiarly in its lock for the first time in three long years. The lights turned on after a brief flicker, and the heater slowly started its task of bringing the room to an acceptable temperature. Compared to the bombed-out husks once belonging to the building's other tenants, the office space seemed relatively peaceful, as if spared from the damage of the months of outright anarchy. Looking around, Sławomir Mentzen was glad he set aside a portion of his funds to renovate it, just in case. He never thought he'd be returning here, much less to weather the storm, but with his usual addresses ransacked and under strict surveillance, it was the only place he could hide while still maintaining the slightest dose of dignity. \n\nIn one of the empty offices, left behind by some temporary associate whose name he had already long forgotten, Mentzen put down his suitcase and laid out the inflatable mattress he'd have to use for the night. After pumping it up just enough to not feel the hard tiles underneath, the former tax consultant sat down on the makeshift bed, nostalgically looking through a series of old documents belonging to his pre-Fall clients. In his present situation, their mundanity seemed comforting after the recent weeks of political disgrace. \n\nThe sudden ring of the doorbell startled Sławomir, bringing him out of his thoughts. His heart skipped a beat as he feared that somehow, the angry mob had even followed him here. If that were the case, he realized, there was pretty much nowhere he could run, unless he was desperate enough to consider exiting through the window, that is. He took a step toward the door, making sure he was quiet enough that his presence couldn't be heard, and took a good look through the peephole. To his reassurance, there seemed to be no mob outside, only a single woman, roughly in her mid-20s, her posture visibly concerned. For a second, he considered whether that, too, could be a trap, but against his better judgment, he decided to let her in. \n\n- Umm, you're... Mr. Mentzen, right? \n- That depends on who's asking. \n- My... my name's Lidia. Lidia Barska. I heard about your recent falling out with Father Rydzyk. I... I believe I have some compromising information that could help you take him on. \n- Mrs. Barska, I'm sorry, but I'm not currently interested in antagonizing him even further. Besides, I highly doubt this information is something I haven't heard about before. \n- Whatever you knew about him isn't even the half of it. I was there, at the complex. A lot. Far more often than I would've wanted to. Please... I need this. For everything he did. Just... hear me out... \n- Alright. But I need you to know - I can't guarantee anything."

TOR.14.t: "The Price of a Clean Soul"
TOR.14.desc: "As he waited for the upcoming mass in humble piety, Paweł couldn't help but feel as out of place as the modernistic façade of the church towering before him. Unlike the unassuming handful pouring into the temple, locked in carefree chatter, he held no hope of receiving any salvation. If some sort of justice truly existed in the afterlife, he knew he'd already condemned himself to the deepest pits of hell. Over his mercenary career, the grizzled soldier managed to accrue a list of atrocities so lengthy, he'd usually be hard-pressed to remember anything past the most recent contract. Perhaps it was the savagery of the conflict that engulfed the once-prospering city or simply the cumulative effect of guilt he could no longer suppress, but after years of unquestioningly following the orders of the highest bidder, some unknown self-reflective force stirred inside Paweł, creating an unending pit of penitence he desperately tried to fill. Yet, the mere desire for change could hardly outweigh the mass of past crimes. No matter how many times he kneeled in quiet submission and how frequently he passed the sign of peace with his still bloodied hands, he could hardly find a reason to justify anything but eternal punishment for his troubled soul. Father Rydzyk gladly offered a solution. \n\nUNIVERSAL ABSOLUTION - the heavily creased pamphlet read in a tone so confident and boisterous, Paweł nearly dismissed it out of hand as the product of some overly enthusiastic marketing guru. Were it not for the weight of the matter, he would've thrown the paper out without a second reading. The claims were more than bold enough to spike his learned sense of risk assessment, or rather, in this case, the sense of knowing when not to waste his oh-so-precious time, but he was beyond desperate. \n\nIt took nearly a quarter of Paweł's entire war chest to secure his admission - a fact he made sure to bring up every time he considered backing out. Though the unexplained delay tested his thin patience, the appearance of nearly the entire clerical elite at the altar did eventually bring some comfort. Stepping up to the rostrum, the event's spiritual host wasted no time on prayers or structure, immediately diving into an impassioned speech. \n\n- Brothers and Sisters, it warms my heart deeply that you graced us with your attendance. The past few months have been a challenge for all of us. I hear many of you asking yourselves the question: how am I now supposed to live with this? And truly, I tell you this: none of us here are saints. None of us can be fully free from sin. And that's not a bad thing. You know well that you have only done what was necessary. Not always through moral means, but for a noble goal. And that is what the godless don't understand. They only want to search for any faults, any reasons to say: look, he's not a good catholic. But the fact that you've come here today already shows your devotion to God. Your sins have been absolved. You proved you are deserving of divine mercy. \n\nTen minutes, not a single one more. As he started shuffling out of the building, Paweł, supposedly now a new man, felt conflicted. He expected a struggle, a monumental battle against his inner demons to claw back at least an inch of redemption, and it was really going to be that easy? Just a few simple words, and he's good to go? Was he really even any different than before? The voice of doubt inside him blared, almost loud enough to miss the final crux of the impromptu homily:"

You have committed unforgivable crimes against God and Man and threatened the integrity of our Church. What do you have to say in your defense? - The parson’s stern voice boomed across the room, equal parts bored and disappointed. \n\nHearing his sins read out in plain text, the condemned priest could feel himself crushed by the full weight of his moral failings. How could he have strayed so far from the teachings? How could he sink so low, betray the Lord for some uncontrolled cravings? He was once just a starry-eyed boy, ready to devote his life to faith. How did it come to this? Now, all he could feel was guilt. - Father, I will not deceive you with claims of innocence, nor will I plead for your forgiveness. I will accept any punishment you deem fit, no matter how harsh. \n\n- Rise. - The ecclesiastical jurist remained unfazed. - You're lucky this didn't get out any further. It took considerable... incentives to make sure they didn't talk. Resources we'd much rather have kept on hand. You've become a risk for us, Father Biernacki.  \n- I am truly sorry, Father. I have failed you, but above all, I have failed God. I know I'm not worthy of this cassock. - Tears welled up in his eyes. - I promise never to wear it again. \n- Oh, stop being such a mess. It happens. You slip up sometimes. What's the big deal all of a sudden? Look, let me tell you this: personally, I like them a bit older, you see. They know when not to tattle. But... I will have to make sure you don't get us in any more trouble. \n- I... I don't understand. But... it's wrong... aren't you going to expel me from the Church? - he sniffled with every word. \n- Now, why would I do that? - The parson laughed heartily. - If I did, there'd soon be nobody left to run this place.  \n- W... what about... \n- Listen, I discussed your case with Rydzyk. He cleared a spot for you under his direct oversight. Consider it... a disciplinary promotion. From now on, you tell him who you want to spend the night with, and he will find a way to get it arranged. Nothing happens without his direct approval, understood? \n- W... why are you... \n- Get over yourself. Grab your stuff and get ready to move. You start tomorrow. And one last thing, Father Biernacki..."

Single passersby, only one person of note - that drunk Wiesiek, probably off for another beer to cure, or prevent, his daily hangover. Will keep an eye on him. \n\n6:12 - Still quiet. The broken streetlights are obscuring my view. Unidentified movement. Probably kids. Or a large animal. Cannot tell. \n\n6:33 - Wiesiek is back with a whole carton. Laid it out on the bench and started downing it brutishly. A few more bums are approaching him with their own drinks. \n\n7:35 - People shuffling off to work. Kinga is wearing that skimpy dress again. Third warning: will report the issue to the parish authorities. They'll sort her out. At least Łucja seems to have learned her lesson. Though she does seem more apprehensive than usual. Suspicious. \n\n10:28 - There was an almost 10-minute delay in the radio program. Unacceptable. \n\n11:13 - Wiesiek and his bunch are getting rowdy. Started catcalling every passing woman aged 15-50. Repeated calls to the authorities to straighten them out have been rudely ignored. \n\n12:51 - And here comes Mariola, that spineless old hag. Seems to be back with groceries. Considerably less than last week, though. Ha, running out of cash maybe? Pension ain't enough? Good. She's got it coming. \n\n14:03 - The kids are beginning to return from school. Oh, they all look so precious. A shame they'll soon grow up into such delinquents. I've seen little Janek with that cigarette he got from God-knows-where. He really thinks I can't spot him behind those bushes. His alcoholic mother must be so proud... \n\n14:40 - The predictable has happened. Wiesiek has passed out on the bench in some unnatural, contorted position. Exactly 21 minutes earlier than yesterday. At least he won't be bothering anyone for the next few hours. \n\n16:31 - Some of the hooligans started gathering on the mound. Troublemakers. Dangerous bunch. Harassed Jadzia on her way back from church on Sunday. Previous report met with a blind dismissal that they're likely just 'good, pious boys, preventing degeneracy on the streets.'

Look, these are those crosses Mariola told me about. \n- Beautiful, oh, truly beautiful, Halinka. - The slightly younger of the two women replied in amazement. - You know, I actually helped fund those. They collected offerings for them at my parish last August. Really had to dig into my pockets for it. Didn't even give Janek any cash for his name day. But oh, was it worth it. \n- You've always been a lucky one. Like that trip to Jasna Góra you won in '97... \n\nPassing by the imposing structure of the Sanctuary, the pair laboriously made their way down a couple of steps and entered the park-like area to its direct Northwest. Awe-struck, they passed by the countless monoliths dotting its landscape, documenting the nation's fallen heroes, occasionally stopping to see if anyone from their childhood years had made the list. \n\n- Halinka, this whole place is breathtaking. Father Rydzyk has truly outdone himself. The folks back home will hardly believe it when I describe it to them. \n- You know, Grażyna... there's only one thing that concerns me. It's so empty. Nice evening, perfect weather, and nobody except us bothered to visit. \n\nThat's how it is these days, dearie. The kids have no God in their hearts. And their parents... don't even get me started. Complete moral downfall. You remember my nephew Paweł? He didn't even push for his son's confirmation. \n\nHearing unknown voices within the secure perimeter, an armed, out-of-breath guard ran up to the visitors, expecting a hostile incursion. Judging the two elders as harmless, the instinctive panic within him gave way to a wave of anger. \n\n- What the hell are you doing here? This is a restricted area! \n- Oh, just taking a little stroll. We haven't been to this place in years. It brings a tear to my eye just how much has changed. Do you work here, sir? Could you please send my regards to Father Rydzyk? \n- THERE WERE 3 GUARD POSTS ALONG THE WAY. HOW DID YOU... \n- Were there really? Well, we must've missed them. Not the same eyesight as back in the day. But when we were your age, you best believe me... \n- YOU CAN'T JUST... ugh... ma'am, listen, I need you to tell me EXACTLY what you saw here. \n- How nice of you to ask, dear. So, first, there was this gorgeous statue of our late pope. Truly lifelike, I must say. You see, I actually met him once over thirty years ago. Not really personally, but... \n- Okay, okay, I get it. Anything actually noteworthy? \n- Definitely this park. Whoever arranged the design has my sincerest congratulations. Kind of reminds me of... \n- Ma'am. - The guard interrupted her before she could begin another unrelated tangent. - Did you spot anything... problematic? \n- Hmm, no, nothing comes to mind. Should I have? \n- Uhhh... no need to worry about it. - He wiped his forehead in relief. - But I will need you to go back now. Come. I'll escort you out. We can grab some postcards on the way."

TOR.18.t: "Donation Control"
TOR.18.desc: "Marcin Sekulski was far from a pious man. When asked about anything remotely political in private, he loved to resort to a simple maxim - 'There are two groups of thieves in this country: the government and the Church.' Before Rydzyk's takeover, the last time Marcin entered a temple was his begrudging attendance at his own daughter's baptism, about which he made sure to complain to anyone who listened. Yet, despite his disdain for organized religion, he recognized it was far better for the safety of his family to act like good Christians for an hour each week than to abandon everything and start life elsewhere, especially considering their shoestring budget. \n\nThough the first few masses consisted mostly of improvisationally following along with whatever the crowd was doing, desperately trying not to give himself away, Marcin quickly got into a rhythm. Always coming in just early enough to grab seats near the middle of the nave, he made sure to perfectly blend in with the broader flock: neither too apathetic nor too eager. Whenever his most dreaded moment of the collection plate being passed came, he glanced at those just before him and copied the exact amount, no matter how unreasonably high it had to be. Ever since his parish installed electronic terminals instead, he had the displeasure of having to guess the perfect amount all on his own. \n\nWhen Marcin stepped up to the machine, just like always, he was greeted by a simple blue screen with nothing but a few buttons displaying different values. Normally, he'd play it safe and go for the fifty, perhaps forty on a bad day, but this time, he could really use some spare cash, and spending half his daily earnings on a donation to his most hated institution was simply too much of an emotional load to bear. \n\nFeeling the rebellious spirit, he bravely pressed the button displaying 25zł and tapped his card instinctively, almost in disgust. Instead of the typical ding, the terminal displayed the message: 'We have encountered problems confirming your payment. Please try again.' \n\nLooking back at the main display, Marcin saw that most of the options on the screen were now gone, with only two remaining: 25zł and 50zł, along with the text: 'Please confirm the amount you wish to donate.' As he once again tapped the same number as before, rather than direct him to the payment, the terminal froze, and a loud alarm blared for the entire church to hear. \n\nFrantically looking around for the source of the ear-splitting noise, Marcin jumped in shock as an arm was placed on his shoulder and two burly men in altar boys' clothing surrounded him. \n\n- Mr. Sekulski, you've chosen to donate 50% less than usual, even though your account balance is pretty much the same. Come with us. We'll make sure to get to the bottom of this... problem."

TOR.19.t: "One Man's Trash..."
TOR.19.desc: "Marian was only one of the dozen or so folks inhabiting the abandoned mill in Winnica. He'd long since given up counting just how many of them he shared the space with. Can't get too attached once the sight of people succumbing to the conditions mere meters from the old mattress and rugs he calls a bed, becomes a regular occurrence. Sometimes, as the cold enveloped him, he could swear he saw them all again. Their faces, free from the signs of constant struggle, called for Marian to give in, but through some unconscious instinct, he simply never could. Not yet. \n\nDuring his usual daily activity of scouring the nearby trash for any usable scrap, Marian came across a neatly packaged, unopened stack of papers stuffed carelessly in the middle of the garbage pile. Either out of curiosity or the desire to check if the packet contained anything of value, he tore the envelope in half and stared blankly at the wording inside - after all, it was clear someone tried hard not to have these delivered. \n\nAt first, the tramp grumbled in irritation upon seeing that the packet contained nothing besides a set of identical copies of an aid application form, but after nearly throwing it away, he was able to put two and two together, realized that he might actually stand to benefit from the program, and hauled the documents back to the mill for everyone to fill out. \n\nOf all the requests sent out by the handful still strong enough to input all the necessary details, Marian's was the sole one not rejected either over some bureaucratic technicality or sent back with a dismissive: 'Not found to be in need of assistance.' Following a few days of silence, a reluctant official arrived to survey the recipient's living conditions; a fact that locked the entire collective into a shouting match over which critically needed resource, out of the multitude they lacked, they wished to pick as their desired subsidy. Seeing the starved faces of his comrades, Marian chose the one thing they could help stave off the worst - food. \n\nThe next day, Marian awoke to the sound of a truck slowly backing up toward the mill's entrance. He quickly got up and rushed to be the first to bring the good news and distribute the reward. Just past the entrance, he was hit with a smell of decay so strong, it caused him to pause right in his tracks. As the vehicle unloaded its cargo, dumping the entirety onto one massive pile before promptly speeding off, the beggar was left with a mass of half-eaten remnants - all that was left from one of the numerous feasts recently hosted at the Sanctuary. Nearly retching in disgust, he began to sift through the contents. At least some of them had to be edible enough, and he swore not to return empty-handed. Not while the others needed his help so desperately."

Now, get to it. \n\nWithout a word, the goons dispersed across the few nearby flats as their kingpin stayed behind in his black sedan. Contentedly watching his underlings hard at work, Father Starzyński opened up a fresh pack of cigarettes, lit up the first one, and enjoyed the well-deserved moment of peace. It was his favorite part of the job. Rather than slaving away all day, carefully maintaining the image of a diligent, pious cleric, he could simply sit back and watch the money pouring in, all without requiring his slightest input. It should be a while before... \n\nA knock on the window. The overgrown figure in front of him seems heavily confused; not that it seems particularly difficult to confuse him. \n\n- Ey boss... uhh... Father. This 'un ain't cooperatin'. Whatcha wan' me to do with 'im? \n- Tell me, Michał. Why do I always have to handle these matters myself? Would it really hurt you to take care of it yourself for once? \n- Well... you did tell me not to hit 'em unless you say so... \n- Ugh, alright, you brute. Watch and learn... again. Try to actually comprehend something this time. \n\nStraightening out his cassock, the priest followed his grunt to the apartment in question. After a polite ring of the doorbell, a startled, middle-aged man greeted the sudden visitor. \n\n- Oh, Father Starzyński, I... didn't expect you here in person. Is there... something wrong? \n\nThe guest bowed politely, as befitting his position. He spoke soothingly, at least at first. \n- Forty-six thousand, Mr. Kotarski. Does that number sound familiar? \n- Umm... I don't think I... \n- It's your family's combined income for the past month. You seem quite well off; my sincerest congratulations to you. So tell me, Mr. Kotarski, what the fuck is this supposed to mean? \n\nThe priest pulled out the hastily ripped envelope filled with a single hundred złoty bill and nearly pushed it in the poor man's face. \n- It seems to me that you clearly don't value our protection. Spiritual, and... material. We live in dangerous times, don't we? It would be a shame if something were to happen to this lovely home of yours. \n- W-what? But I... we always paid this much. We've always been generous to the Church... \n- Times have changed. Prices have gone up. And I can tell you right now that if this is all the money you can cough up, let's just say we can no longer guarantee your safety... \n- Oi boss! Can we finally whack 'im? - One of the muscled-up altar boys blurted out, bored with the not-so-subtle intimidation. \n- Shhh, Michał. Not yet. - The clergyman turned back to the homeowner. - Ain't he a sweet one? So, what will it be? Would you like to give a satisfactory offering after all? \n\nTerrified, not so much of the priest as of the brutes standing behind him, the host reached for a small box and hurriedly pulled out a small stack of bills, presenting them as tribute. \n\n- You seem to have more stored away in there, Mr. Kotarski. Don't think we wouldn't notice. \n- But... this is already more than is required. Please, that is my entire crisis fund. I can't... \n- Next time, make sure to hand over the required amount at the first time of asking. Your choice. You know the alternative."

The lack of any heavy weaponry during the conflict is perhaps the only reason why the inelegant, concrete apartment blocks of the Soviet era managed to survive, albeit riddled with countless bullet holes and largely emptied out. The area was never considered high-class, but it was livable, despite its somewhat notorious reputation. Nowadays, it was the home of the runts of society - those unfortunate or crazy enough not to immediately leave for greener pastures. One thing was known - nobody came here without a clear purpose, and nobody stayed longer than they absolutely needed to. \n\nTadeusz Rydzyk steeled himself for the upcoming task. It sounded simple: pass through the area with a considerable escort, give out a few blessings, tell the good word to the struggling population... all basic PR work, like the good old days. He took another sip of the fine whisky, sighed, then downed the rest of the glass in one strong swig. In moments like this, he preferred to have his senses at least partially numbed. \n\nStepping out onto this godforsaken land, Rydzyk carefully considered his surroundings. He felt uneasy, far from the usual order of his carefully maintained environs. It didn't take long before he began to attract attention, something he desperately hoped to avoid. At first, it was confused glances, as if unsure if the priest was merely an illusion. Then, ragged, disheveled figures began to slowly gather along his path. Were they friendly? Hostile? He knew one thing - he'd much rather keep his distance. Eventually, one of the stragglers, a man in his late thirties, so unkempt he'd easily pass for double his real age, broke through the cordon and ran up to the esteemed visitor. \n\n- Father Director! Father Director! I... it's really you! Our prayers have been answered; praise the Lord! \n\nInstinctively, the priest recoiled, pulling back half a step to avoid any contact with the obtrusive pauper, who, by now, was on his knees, in disbelief that such a holy figure would grace his presence. \n\n- Yes, umm... please accept this blessing. May your faith not waver, and you shall be rewarded. - He performed a half-hearted sign of the cross, carefully keeping his distance from the devotee. - Now, please step aside. \n\nHowever minor, this perceived dispensing of divine favor only served to rile up the substantial crowd that gathered around Rydzyk, each of the inhabitants desperate for some sort of positive impulse in their lives, no matter how minor. With near-immediate speed, they began closing the distance, overpowering any attempts of the security detail to maintain control. \n\n- Father Director! If I could humbly ask... \n- For my family! Please, one for the family! \n- Please bless us, Father Rydzyk. We only need... \n\nThough the cleric worked with the speed of an assembly line on overdrive to hand out an unending amount of meaningless blessings, the frenzied tide of the faithful could not be stemmed.

TOR.23.desc: "Father Grakowicz has always been one to stay on the sidelines. While others busied themselves with the political struggle, the member of the moderate wing of the Redemptorist congregation focused his life's work on the spiritual side of the Church's mission. During his lengthy clerical tenure, he had served in many posts throughout the country, though all of them failed to get him any attention beyond his congregations. \n\nUnsurprisingly, this lack of notoriety made Grakowicz the perfect fit to oversee the city's second-largest redemptorist parish. Even though his position would normally call for him to at least attempt to rival Rydzyk, the priest made little effort to proclaim any stances, no matter how problematic the Father Director's actions became. At times, he chastised himself for not speaking up; for not steering the Faith in the way it had been righteously intended. In his eyes, the hypocrisy his now-superior represented could only lead to an even further deterioration of the Church's respect in the eyes of the people. To now be openly forced to praise him felt like a bitter pill, and for the first time in his thirty years of service, Father Grakowicz considered making his opposition heard. \n\nAs he stood at the altar, the priest observed the temple's interior, looking carefully from right to left. The size of the audience surprised him. Not once in the last five, perhaps even ten years... no, maybe even since his late childhood, had he seen a nave so packed to the brim with worshipers. All their eyes were glued to him reverently, with not a single disinterested expression in sight. The only ones not focusing intently on his words stood in a long queue for the confessional, repeatedly muttering the proper sequence of words to not irritate the confessor inside. A joyful tear swelled in his eye right as he was about to speak. \n\n- My dear Brothers and Sisters, I have many disagreements with Father Rydzyk. Before I began, I wrote a little note not to forget any of them. I ran out of space, so I had to get another. I will not stand before you today and tell you that he represents the epitome of Christian values. I'd have to answer before God for breaking the eighth commandment if I did. But seeing you all gathered here today, I can say one thing: Tadeusz Rydzyk is the best thing that has happened to Polish society in this entire century. Whatever his faults may be, he is the only person capable of restoring this country to its religious roots. And you can all silently judge him, and you can be assured that I will do so as well, but I implore each and every one of you to look beyond the Father Director's personal moral failings and appreciate all the good he has done, and continues to do, for the world. Forget not that only God is free from sin. Brothers and Sisters, in honor of Father Rydzyk, join me in prayer: Ave Maria..."

When they are scared, those without Him in their hearts do bad stuff. - The teacher, roughly in her mid-20s, answered eagerly without much thought. \n- How can you not like God? Everyone likes God. - Another pupil chimed in. \n- Well... it's hard for me to believe either, but some people, faced with the truth of the Bible, see the Lord as anything other than the source of all good. \n- Like with the Flood? \n- What about the Flood, Ania? \n- I mean... didn't all the people who couldn't get on the Ark die? \n- Yes, but they were sinners. Noah was righteous, and God saved him from the water. \n- Should sinners die? My dad's a sinner. I don't want him to die. - A boy spoke out, worried. \n- Look, I'll ask Father Opałka to come and explain the story to you again on Monday. Can we get back to the lesson, please? \n\nThe dilapidated classroom, with crosses, ornaments, and pictures of prominent clergymen hung right above the whiteboard, was full of all sorts of ruckus. The kids were talking over each other, making the teacher call for everyone's attention. She switched to the next slide with the title 'The Dangers of Communism' in red coloring. \n\n- Miss Kasia, what is a communist? - Little Jaś asked sheepishly. \n- Umm... a communist... is someone who thinks everyone should have the same amount of everything - both good and bad people. - She didn't know. She was guessing. \n- But you always told us to share. Are you a communist, Miss Kasia? \n- No, that's... it's different, alright? For example, communists don't like to pray. You can tell someone is a communist when they act up and disobey what they're told. \n- Miss, one time, you didn't do what Father Opałka asked. Does that mean... \n- No! Enough. You're getting detention. I can't be bothered with you today. \n\nIn the back of the class, another kid raised his hand shyly. \n\n- Miss Kasia, is Jaś a communist?"

Our commanders are still figuring out the supply lines, and there must have been a mix-up with the delivery because by the time they got to me, I had to throw half the items away, but the ones I was able to reheat were still a dozen times better than the rations they usually give us. At least I'm lucky to be on good terms with the cook; otherwise, I would've had to eat everything that you've made cold. \n\nThe front's still a mess. Not much has changed on that part since I last wrote. We still get the occasional cheers as we pass by, but the further we get from Toruń, the more hostile the locals tend to become. You wouldn't believe some of the insults they throw at us. You'd think that the light of our Lord reaches everywhere, but it seems that outside the range of our station, the darkness has made its way into the people's hearts. Knowing that we're fighting to bring them salvation makes it easier to endure the hardships, but sometimes, it gets hard to keep marching, knowing there's only going to be more peril ahead. \n\nGrandma, I miss home. I miss you, my parents, and even Wojtek a little bit. After being separated from everyone for so long, you learn to appreciate all the little things you always take for granted. I know how important our mission is, but I just wish to be back in my room; to have a normal life again. I'm guessing that you'll probably end up showing this letter to the rest of the family, and I can already see how funny those words will seem to them since I was the one who ran away, but if there's anything I'd want you to relay to them, it's that I apologize. I don't know if by the time this war is done, I'll even have a home to return to. I don't expect anyone to forgive me, but I'd give everything up to start again. \n\nAs much as I'd like to describe everything my unit and I have been through, I'm afraid this is all I can write for now. We're being called for another offensive. I'm to be part of the spearhead. Please, if you can, pray for me and my safety. And thank you. I don't know how long I would've lasted without your help.

On the opposite side of an all-purpose table, her husband, Mirosław, had just started dealing the cards for another round of solitaire. In the corner of the room, a portable radio played a recording of last Sunday's homily. The sound continued unnoticed in the background as the couple focused on their activities. \n\n- Your illegitimate country has turned away from God. \n\nThe words didn't catch much attention besides a small furrow of the brow from Mirosław. Krystyna got up to make herself some tea. \n\n- By fighting against all that is righteous, your country has doomed you and blocked your path to salvation. \n\nConcerned, Mirosław stopped dealing the cards. He called his wife over to come back immediately and hear what the priest was saying. She had just put the kettle on. \n\n- For is it not a sin to see injustice and refuse to call it out? To reap the rewards of service to someone who defies the Lord? When we refuse to speak, we give our quiet support for their blasphemous actions. We make ourselves guilty by association. \n\nBy now, the two were listening in intently, transfixed on the fiery, judgmental words coming out of the radio. They feared for their souls; they feared their inaction had paved their way to eternal suffering in the depths of hell. \n\n- And even if we confess, even if we maintain our own personal piety, we do little to save ourselves, for what good is repentance if you continue to live in sin? Only by breaking out of this spiritual prison do we guarantee ourselves a chance at redemption in the eyes of the Lord. \n\nConcern was slowly giving way to determination. They couldn't let the actions of their government stand between them and God. Whatever was necessary, they knew they had to do it, no matter how demanding. \n\n- Brothers and sisters, you need to rise up against this injustice. You must do all in your power to oppose, hinder, and strike against those who oppress the faithful. Know that the Lord always watches. You cannot hide from his judgment. Take up arms against those godless tyrants. Spread this message to anyone who can also be saved. And if you fall, dear listeners, your sacrifice will undoubtedly ensure your place in His kingdom. \n\nThe homily ended, and the broadcast cut to a soft tune. \n\n- Krystyna, get me my gun.

Every couple of seconds, he turned in discomfort, eliciting an irritating series of creaks from the old sofa bed made available by his hosts. Annoyed, he stared blankly at the half-a-century-out-of-style wall unit covering a substantial portion of the room, decorated with unused silverware and photos of people who've likely since aged a generation. The gentle chirp of the birds outside harmonized with the low hum of the portable radio stationed in the kitchen - a sign that one of the owners was already up. Between the intense training regimen demanded by his unit and the near-constant availability he had to maintain, the mercenary expected to spend all his available alone time soundly passed out, but the troubles of acclimatization continued to weigh on him. \n\nMiłosz heard two knocks before the handle turned, and a woman roughly in her mid-sixties entered the room, carrying a simple homemade breakfast. He quickly checked the time - it was 6:02. \n\n- Wake up, sleepyhead. It's daytime already. \n- Huh? - He answered in a half-asleep tone. - Get off my back; I'm way too tired for this. \n\nThe elder lady ignored her guest's complaints, put the plate on a small coffee table next to the bed, and, with a surprisingly swift move, opened the blinds, filling the room with light. \n\n- Seriously, what's wrong with you, woman? - The mercenary hissed, covering his eyes to shield them from the sudden brightness. \n- Cmon, get up. We'll be late for church. Father Milejczuk's celebration of the Roraty is not something you want to miss. \n- Church? I have to be up in an hour to check in for my morning drills. You honestly think I'd rather spend this time on some non-obligatory mass? I need to get some actual sleep, for fuck's sake. \n- Oh, that. I spoke with your captain yesterday. He agreed to give you the day off if you spent the day with me. \n- Wait... you really did that? For me? But why? - A genuine tear of happiness welled up in the corner of Miłosz's eye. He was far from being used to nice gestures. \n- Of course. All that war and fighting you do... sometimes, it's easy to forget who it's all for. Besides, I don't believe you've gotten a proper welcome. I can show you around the city. \n- I don't know what to say... \n- You can thank me later, young man. Right now, I need you at the door in no more than thirty minutes. Here's breakfast. Just don't take too long.

It brought him no enjoyment, maybe besides the fact that he felt tough when he winced from the taste. He contemplated immediately ordering another, but he was getting dangerously close to remembering. The past, the faces... the pain... A firm grip on his shoulder interrupted the incoming descent. \n\n- Well, I'll be damned. Karol fuckin' Michalczak, live in the flesh. I thought you died back in Ukraine, ya bastard. \n- Wish I did, man. Wish I did. But damn does that brings me back. Those were the times. \n- We sure gave those Russians hell. The Ukrainians couldn't have done it without us. \n- Mhm, and then as soon as that's done, they turn around and invade us. Fuckin' khokhols... \n- Ungrateful as always. But I'm not here to whine. That's their problem, not mine. - He paused, changing the topic. - So what’s a cruel ol’ bastard like you doing in a place like this? You don’t strike me as a penitent.  \n- Neither do you. For two years we’ve fought together, I ain’t seen you pray once. \n- Mariupol. I prayed in Mariupol. \n- Yeah, you thought you were going to die, you idiot. That don’t count. It’s something you’re supposed to do on your own. \n- Well, well. Look who's had a religious awakening in his old age... \n- Put some respect on the name, eh? I ain't here on some glorified mission trip. I doubt you're here for that reason either. \n- Me? Nah, no way I'd reduce myself to a groveling paragon of virtue. It's far too late for that, anyway. But if I can keep doing what I've always done and get back some favor with the big guy upstairs in the process, you know damn well I'm down for a contract. \n- Cmon, you really believe all that 'absolution' crap? You've been killin', lootin', and whorin' all your life, and you expect it all to be forgiven just because one priest says so? \n- Karol, if you thought it's all bullshit, you wouldn't have come here all the way from Silesia. Of course, it's unlikely to change a thing. I ain't stupid. But I think you and I both know it's our only chance. \n- It really is this or nothing, huh? Get me another drink, man.

He felt as though he was losing a considerable portion of his honor in the process, but the offer was simply too good to pass up, far better than the option of facing a military tribunal. The battalion's headquarters, though familiar, felt unusually claustrophobic now that he wasn't the one in charge. Though he knew that things would soon return to normal, he still experienced a profound humiliation - the unerasable blemish of defeat. The signature would only make it official. \n\nBefore the Colonel even got the chance to make contact with the document, the door swung open with force as his commanding officer burst into the room. \n- Is anybody going to tell me what the hell this is supposed to be? - Adamczak waved a small slip of paper furiously. \n- This? That's just a simple pledge of allegiance to Father Rydzyk. Nothing out of the ordinary. All our enlisted soldiers have to sign it. - The chaplain answered, unbothered. \n- We had an agreement. You let me and my men off the hook as long as we agree to serve in your army. This was not part of that agreement! \n- Circumstances change. At present, we cannot offer you any special treatment, no matter what your rank is. \n- I am a General of the Polish Army! I will not bow before some theocrat with delusions of grandeur! \n- A General who has failed to defend himself from three separate invasions... \n- Unlike you, and apparently unlike Colonel Dyk, I still have some sense of honor. I have over forty years of tactical, command, and logistical experience. You will treat me as befits someone of my stature! \n- No matter how much of a fuss you make, General, you cannot change reality. Where was all that experience when you lost to a bunch of untrained peasants and a handful of uncoordinated mercenaries? If you had done a better job, you wouldn't have found yourself in this position. This is the best offer you're going to get. Take it or get out. \n- Ha, good luck. - Adamczak snarked. - You wouldn't have lasted a week in my position. I can tell by the way you utilize your units that you're a complete amateur without any formal training. You'll find out how difficult this role is soon enough. Rest assured that I'll be watching your pitiful performance with a good deal of satisfaction. \n\nJust as abruptly as he entered, the General left the room, tearing up the pledge and leaving it behind him as he stormed out."

His co-conspirator was already expecting him. \n\n- Well, well. Look who it is. I thought I'd never see you again. How long has it been? - Mentzen spoke with a slightly relieved tone \n- About... three years now, I think. The times haven't been kind since we split up. \n- Yeah, I can tell. You look like crap. It's been that bad, huh? \n- Are you surprised? I'm lucky to even be alive. After Rydzyk's invasion, I was forced to relocate with what remained of my boys. You know how hard it is to get even basic supplies in these forests? \n- Mhm, so how do you get by? - He asked, with a hint of curiosity and slight amusement. \n- We raid, we loot, we take what we need, and then we relocate. It's almost surprising how little security they're setting up. The East is still mostly uncontrolled. All they did was rout us and then immediately move on. \n- For now. You know just as well that this isn't going to last. Once the wars end, the crackdowns will start... \n- And that's exactly why I'm here. You've got quite a nice setup, Sławek. I was thinking the two of us could maybe help each other out. \n- So... what exactly is it that you're expecting? \n- Well, you despise Rydzyk; I despise Rydzyk. You have the funds, I have... well, I used to have a paramilitary. But with a few generous donations, I could put it back together. If we get the timing right, we could make some sort of play and take the bastard down. - His eyes lit up in determination. \n- Look, I'm sorry, but there's not much I can currently do to assist you. I'm barely managing as it is. They're watching every move I make. I can't even leave this building with a dozen eyes following me. \n- So what, you're just going to surrender without a fight? Is this how you're planning to spend the rest of your life? \n- Just because I'm not rushing to get myself killed doesn't mean I'm not making my own plans. \n- Tell that to my men who are hiding in the woods, living off plundered scraps! \n- I'll take good care of them.

If you needed anything, you had to drive out to town to get it. If something broke down, your best bet was to fix it yourself because who knows how long it would take for the local administration to bother sending anyone to fix it. Even the priest who showed up for Sunday mass made sure to leave as soon as he was done with the service. Kazimierz Biernat was going to be the first resident Pastor the village hosted in... well, even the elders failed to remember when, or if, any of them bothered to stay here longer than a couple of hours. On an uncharacteristically warm day, almost a third of the population of just over five hundred came out of their homes to greet their new spiritual guardian. At 2:15 pm., a quarter late for the mass's planned start, the priest drove up in his black Mercedes. \n- Seriously? This is where they send me after six years of seminary? - Father Biernat grumbled to himself as he exited the car. \n\nAn unremarkable man approached the priest hurriedly, bowing before him politely. \n\n- Welcome, Father. We are honored by your presence and grateful that you decided to call this place your home. It's probably quite a different setting than the one you are used to, but we'll do all that we can to make sure you feel welcome. As the Wójt of this county, I'll personally... \n- Uh-huh. So I'm guessing this pile of rocks is your church, right? \n- Well, it's... certainly not some impressive basilica... - He laughed nervously. - But it does have its charm. \n- Listen, I have some standards. I'm not going to degrade myself to carrying out my ministry in this dump. \n- We're... terribly sorry, Father. Is there anything we can do to convince you? \n- I guess you can start by renovating and expanding the church to a respectable level. \n- I... doubt we have the money for such a project. \n- That's not my problem, is it? I'm not holding a single mass here until that's done. Call me when you think you're ready to host me somewhere that's less pathetic than this. \n- That might take some time, I'm afraid. - The wójt said, grinding his teeth in irritation. \n- Great. Oh, and one last thing. My stipend just got doubled. Seems fair for even considering taking this position, so don't disappoint me. \n\nWithout waiting for the official's protests, the priest got back in his car and left the village just as quickly as he arrived."

Even though he hadn't been here in a while, there was no way for the place not to feel comforting after calling it his home for nearly half of his already lengthy life. In some cruel display of intolerance, to silence the truth, both Bruski's liberal administration and the supposedly legitimate Chruch authorities tried to muffle him, preventing the priest from preaching even in his own parish. The Father Director could not let such an unfair punishment stand. \n\nA picture of Dmowski still hung on the eastern wall. It was the only object that hadn't been moved during his absence. They knew he would return. Some feared it; some awaited it. Now, he would pass judgment on the wicked. \n\n- Any news on their whereabouts? - Kneblewski felt immense satisfaction as he imagined finally capturing the missing officials of the city's former administration. \n- Umm, whose whereabouts, exactly, Father? - An altar boy asked in a frightful voice. \n- What do you mean 'whose'? Bruski, Krupa, the whole damn lot. \n- N... no signs so far. \n- I gave you one task, Kacper. One task. Is that really too much to ask? \n- I... I don't know. My parents made me sign up here. - The boy ran out of the room, sobbing. \n\n- Ugh, useless. Tell me that at least you have some good news, Wiktor. \n- Yes, Father! I closed down the bars, shut down the brothels, and burned all satanic books I could find, just as you asked! - He reported with uncontained excitement. \n- Hold on. You did that? You did all of that by yourself? \n- I brought a couple of my friends along. We really showed them! They were all completely scared when we came. Ha, they better be! That's what happens when you don't respect the Lord's commandments! \n- I don't even know what to say beyond the fact that I'm impressed. Go get yourself some communion wine as a reward. \n- But Father, I'm not allowed to... \n- Shh, you've earned it. Knock yourself out, kid. \n\nSatisfied, Kneblewski turned back towards the desk. Perhaps there was still hope for his little fiefdom.

There were no opportunities in Toruń, not for someone like her, at least. Back in Włocławek, she could've been anything. The sisterhood provided its members with near-complete freedom. Monika chose to be an artist. Her work was never unique enough to turn heads, but someone always threw in the occasional dime. Coupled with the subsidy that the state provided for creative fields, it was sufficient to maintain a decent standard of living. The times were good, and the work was tolerable. Above everything, after all the disappointments and restrictions the Polish government enforced throughout her life, she finally felt free. Now, it had all been taken away. \n\nIn Toruń, realistically, there were only two possible outcomes Monika could expect. All the 'traditional values' and 'homemaking' classes told her as much. Most likely, she was to be married off to some desperate, abusive boy. There were plenty of those in the city, and most already expected a reward for their service. On the other hand... Rydzyk took care of his own. She kept hearing those words as if it was meant to be some positive advertisement. The thought of what that really entailed made her stomach churn. She knew she had to create a third option for herself, somehow. \n\nOn the way back, Monika had a vision. During the morning prayer, Mary, Mother of God, had revealed herself to the thus far impious girl. She brought blessings upon the land and bore good providence for the Church that served her name. The revelation shook Monika deeply as she fell to her knees and confessed all her sins. At least that was the story she sold her captors. The genuine fear of what awaited her in the city helped her play the part. \n\nAt her request, Monika was rushed to the convent to dedicate herself to a monastic life. She realized she'd have to spend every single day of the rest of her life pretending, but still, it seemed far better than the alternatives. The harsh, unwelcoming exterior of the building made her temporarily reconsider, but before she could act, the Mother Superior had already come out to welcome her, dismissing the guards. \n\n- There was no revelation, was there? - The nun asked in an authoritative tone. \n- H... huh? No, I'm being honest. Mary revealed herself and... \n- Oh, don't give me that made-up story. I've heard it a hundred times before. I can tell when someone's faking it. \n- Please, just don't send me back... \n- You think anybody here cares what Rydzyk wants? Half of us used to be part of the resistance. You're safe here.

He did not complain. Always eager to help, he was one of the few seminarists in his class whose devotion actually seemed genuine. \n\n- Czarek, do you recognize any of the people in this room? - Jan Król pointed to three clergymen standing in the corner with a defiant expression, most of them twice, if not thrice, the deacon's age. \n- Of course. Well, two of them. The one on the left is Bishop Okroj. The one in the middle... that's Bishop Orchowicz. I can't quite recall the last one, but I know I've seen him at some point as well. \n- Huh, almost three for three. You missed bishop Wętkowski. But that's beside the point. I didn't bring you here just to play a guessing game. \n- I'm happy to serve our esteemed guests in any capacity you deem necessary, Father Król. - The deacon nearly bowed, instinctively. \n- No, no. If anything, they're going to serve you now. \n- Pardon? How so? \n- Are you a member of the Redemptorist congregation, Czarek? \n- Well, yes, but what does that have to do with... \n- Great. Almost thought you forgot there for a second. By decree, you outrank all clergymen not associated with the congregation. And since you’re only at the beginning of your journey, to be outranked by you means… well, essentially, it means being back at square one. \n- So you’ve just demoted some of the most prominent members of the Polish clergy? I trust your judgment, Father, but I can’t see how that’s warranted. \n- It’s not without reason. As you already know, we have a particular way of doing things around here. Those who were astray for most of their lives might have a difficult time adjusting to some of our more… unique practices. \n- So… want me as a temporary aide to help speed up the process? - The deacon cluelessly replied. \n- No, Czarek. Screw the old hierarchy. These people are below you now. Their ranks mean nothing. I've assigned them as your apprentices. I expect you to break them in. \n- And how exactly should I... \n- Remember all that hazing you had to go through in your first years in the seminary? Just do a bunch of that. Get creative.

For the last six years, he'd studied under the watchful eye of the redemptorist clergy, but during that time, not once did he get a chance to speak with the main man himself. Not in private, at least. At times, the Father Director would surprise the seminarists with an unexpected visit, usually coupled with some standard lecture about piety, modesty, and the like. Even these brief appearances were enough for the freshly ordained clergyman to start admiring his spiritual superior. Now that he'd joined the ranks of the congregation, he'd been bestowed the highest honor - he was summoned for an audience with Rydzyk. \n\nThe waiting room before the entrance to the study stunned Artur with its opulence. Two rows of marble statues covered either side of the rectangular corridor, each increasing in size and detail as one got closer to the door. Above its frame, hung a massive painting, stylized to resemble stained glass, of the Father Director towering over the world in a saintly form. From there, if one were to turn around, they'd see the splendor progressively diminishing with each step away from Rydzyk's quarters. Away from his light. A weak, raspy, but weirdly soothing voice called him in. \n\nStanding in the presence of his highest authority, Artur immediately got on his knees and bowed before the Father Director. The priest gestured for him to stand, smirking at the voluntary display of submission. \n\n- Congratulations, my child. You’ve completed a journey not many even dare embark on. As a reward, you may now freely choose your blessing. \n- A blessing, Father? - He asked, unsure. \n- Anything you'd like. You're one of us now. It's only appropriate that you receive a fitting present for your introduction. \n- If I may; if it's not too much of an ask, your benediction would be all I could ever need. \n\nRydzyk raised his eyebrow in surprise, as if the disciple had just said something concerning. \n\n- Seriously? You can have anything you'd like: a nice big cheque, luxury cars, your own little community out in the province to worship you... and you chose to instead hear a few encouraging words? That's it? \n-As was said in the book of Matthew: 'It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.' I wish not to go against His word. \n- Yeah, yeah. I know the quote. But you'd only be taking what is rightfully yours.
