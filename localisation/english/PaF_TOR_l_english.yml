TOR_tadeusz_rydzyk_desc: "By all measures, the priestly life is that of sacrifice, the ultimate forfeiture of worldly pleasures in the service of a greater purpose. Though few among the clergy still retain any degree of influence, the creed of a model theocrat still decrees - resist the temptations of power and use it to guide your flock. Not all, however, see this obligation as a desirable course to follow. \n\nSurrounded by vain and splendor, Tadeusz Rydzyk stands as the antithesis of the morality he so fiercely preaches. Having built a faith-based media empire through his business acumen and natural charisma alone, the priest made no doubt as to the master to whom he truly adheres. Though draped in the visage of Christian piety, any devotion Rydzyk might have had comes in a distant second to the mountain of self-servitude enabled by the generous donations of the gullible followers who see him as a paragon of virtue - a lone proselytizer single-handedly stemming the tide of encroaching godlessness. It is through their offerings that he rose from an unknown provincial cleric into one of the greatest kingmakers of the Third Republic. Soon, the priest's private temple in Toruń became the destination of many a pilgrimage - not only for the faithful masses but for the dozens of conservative elites showering him with lavish gifts in exchange for political support. \n\nDespite its colossal effect on every facet of the country, even an event as monumental as the Fall could do little to stop the machinations of someone as resourceful and fanatically revered as Rydzyk. He had bested every challenge against his authority, emerging from the muck of the Toruń Anarchy as a triumphant conqueror. In a way, against all justice, the Father Director has already won, free to indulge any craving he may ever desire. Having achieved the culmination of his desires, he sees no further reason to strain himself, and the Church suffers for it, unable to change its ways or adapt to new challenges, with an increasingly decrepit fossil at its helm. \n\nThe spirit remains strong, but the body turns weak. The march of time will claim us all, but for Father Rydzyk, there is not much sand left in the hourglass. Once the last grains fall, his soul will face two Final Judgments - the divine and the temporal. The first one will see his damnation. The second may sanctify his name or condemn it for all eternity. Use your final moments wisely, Father Director."
TOR_tadeusz_rydzyk_reactionary_desc: "A cult of personality cannot survive the death of its creator. Therefore, even though the soul had long since abandoned the mortal plane and the body rots inside a marble casket, the Father Director may never be laid to rest, for his is the throne of Kuyavia. His radiance shines from the Heavens in tandem with the Blessed Virgin’s light - a blessing on the land; now and forevermore. In turn, the Family faithfully worships its saintly Father, showering the Church with unprecedented gifts and devotion. Tadeusz Rydzyk is no longer bound by the original sin. He is a symbol. A pillar. A representation of the ideal to which all good Christians shall strive on their paths to salvation. \n\nAnd yet, beyond the brazen idolatry and religious paranoia, the more cynical side begins to emerge. The people’s reaction to Rydzyk’s passing had truly been overwhelming. If only their devotion could be molded, all limits to the Church’s temporal authority would instantly crumble. For his will is divine, and no mortal may knowingly defy it. Those who work in the shadows can still hide behind the protective veil he so graciously provides, as the servants remain so even after their master’s passing, except now, they have only themselves to serve. \n\nAnd so, the Father Director speaks to his flock through the lips of the clergy, and the words of Father Król, feeding on the praise and shouldering the blame. He is the perfect puppet for those in charge - with infinite authority and no speck of agency. Never again will he protest. Never again will he block much-needed reforms. He is that which his controllers need him to be. The legacy of Tadeusz Rydzyk dies at the hands of Tadeusz Rydzyk, and he is perfectly happy about it, for that is what he has been made to be. \n\nPerhaps, during breaks from his eternal torment, the Father Director gets to look up from the depths he now resides in and find some comfort in his people's reverence, unless seeing the idealized image of what he could have been is a torture in and of itself."
TOR_slawomir_mentzen_desc: ""
TOR_jan_krol_desc: "Father Jan Król is the last man anyone would expect atop the clerical hierarchy. Unremarkable, reserved; he always found his natural place not in the spotlight, but in the shadows, managing the Church’s daily operations while others smiled for the cameras - a perfect advisor for someone whose ego required constant validation. Even a full list of the priest's many titles would be an injustice to the fruits of his labour, happily consumed by the faithful, slapped with anyone else's label but his. Yet he never cared for the recognition, openly avoiding it as the light of fame shines with overwhelming brightness on the hands that work only in the dark. \n\nIn many ways, Król is the polar opposite of Rydzyk - the second half of a greater whole that guided the Radio Maryja family for the past three decades. The Son and the Holy Spirit. Two-thirds of Toruń's divine Trinity. One cannot exist without the other. And yet, he must now survive without the Father, bearing the full weight of his late mentor's legacy on his tired shoulders. \n\nDespite the differences, despite the dichotomies, one word connects both the past and the present - greed. With no other way to distinguish himself from the ever-beloved Rydzyk, Father Król brandishes his greatest sin as a sign of his supposed virtue, twisting the dogma to portray the wealth he stole as proof of divine providence. Indeed, if God is all-loving, would he not reward those who most faithfully serve Him? But alas, even that is a façade, carefully marketed to fill the void left behind by the Father Director's passing. In truth, he detests the fake aloofness with every fiber of his being. \n\nAnd so, the Church moves forward, steeped in sin and contradiction. The wealth pours in, funding Król's various ventures and passion projects, but most of all, a life of luxury he wishes to enforce on the entire clerical class. Vanity is a virtue, and avarice will bring you salvation. §RHe may have his paradise on Earth, but Father Król is yet to find out that no amount of money will be enough to buy him a ticket to Heaven.§!"
TOR_Sanktuarium_desc: "The gates have been closed, all visitors have been ushered out, and now only an ominous silence remains. To the ever-faithful congregants in Toruń, the Sanctuary Complex represents unreachable sanctity, to an increasing number of detractors - a detachment from the world's affairs. Nobody truly knows what occurs inside these walls, save for a clerical elite bound by strict vows of silence, forbidden to leave, imprisoned in their own island of spiritual solitude. Still, despite all the secrecy, rumors spill through, spreading like wildfire throughout all of Kuyavia. Sins, miracles; each story shines a new light on the most valuable prisoner of them all - he, who designed not only its walls, but the foundations of the entire nation. \n\nInside, the Father Director writhes in agony, surrounded by his most trusted aides, separated from the public view by twelve feet of concrete and an entire regiment of armed guards. The passion that once burned inside him, inspiring his ascendance, has been reduced to a handful of embers, waiting to be put out by the first gust of wind that brushes against them. He is no longer the all-powerful theocrat, but rather an empty husk, blocking all meaningful change with his final breaths. In his present state, he devotes himself neither to God nor the worldly pleasures he previously enjoyed. All carry with them an expectation of effort he can no longer muster. He can only lie there, idly, hardly recognizing himself, his Church, his people... \n\nWith the seclusion of most high-ranking clergy, the grip of absolute control over the people has finally slipped. The efforts of those tasked with maintaining order have turned inwards, as Kuyavia has mostly been left to fend for itself. Voices of discontent, normally so hushed and violently suppressed, may once again echo out for all to hear. The voivodeship may pray in unison, but those with sinister plans eye one another conspiratorially, communicating that which cannot be openly said. \n\nNobody, neither on the inside nor the outside, knows how much time remains. This moment of weakness will only be temporary. Eventually, the Spirit will ascend, and the full might of worldly judgment shall bear down on those who tried to weigh it down with sin. \n\n§RThere will never be another opportunity for change. Those who wish to usher it in must rip the keys to the kingdom from a dying man's hands.§!"

Most people do not see Rydzyk as an exalted figure, but rather as yet another greedy strongman seeking to profit from religion.

TOR_vices_idea: "The Vices"
TOR_vices_idea_desc: "Civil war is, without a doubt, the worst of all possible kinds of conflicts. Toruń and its surroundings have not escaped the consequences of their own history. The Anarchy has ravaged not only the material environment but also the minds of the inhabitants. Corruption, suspicion, particularism. An atmosphere of endless conflicts, misunderstandings, and hatred prevails. Righteousness has been buried deep beneath the rubble of destroyed homes. In turn, the victors emerge with a deep moral scar burdening their hearts.  Will they ever purge themselves of the weight of their sins?"

TOR_sowing_the_grains_idea: "Begrudging Investments"
TOR_sowing_the_grains_idea_desc: "In order to kickstart the Church economy on the ruins of a wartorn city placed right in the center of an even more destroyed country, the deep coffers of the Redemptorists must be tapped into, despite the protests of some of the more materialistic elements within the clergy. Raw capital is the simplest way to muster the workforce and materials necessary for swift rebuilding, and the returns will be comparatively imminent. If not, they will gladly take back every single Złoty."

TOR_Cassocks: "The Rot Within"
TOR_Cassocks_desc: "The words of moral purity so fiercely preached from the church pulpits hold little weight for those who claim to lead their congregations by example. Tadeusz Rydzyk, together with his inner circle, fully tolerates the ethical and spiritual indulgence of his priests, so long as it remains behind closed doors. The Father Director is meticulous in ensuring that no clerical scandals seep into the public eye, for they would immediately harm him as well. The faithful are treated according to the principle: 'What the eyes do not see, the heart does not grieve over.'"

TOR_rozjebalo_miasto1_desc: "After a prolonged civil war, one could expect nothing but a city in ruins - and this time was no different. Destruction has swept across the entire country, yet Toruń has experienced some of the worst post-Fall fighting. The Church now stands on a pile of rubble, tasked with the expectation of restoring it to its former glory. But to once again become the region's historic jewel, the city will need significant time... and money. Especially the latter. The beleaguered citizens may soon find that their spiritual guardians aren't particularly eager to part ways with their funds. If they want to heal from the days of the Anarchy, they might just have to bear the brunt of the effort themselves."

And in the absence of local professionals, rather than satisfy ourselves with handing a gun to every geriatric follower who volunteers and sending them off to die, the armed forces import those who agree to fight for the highest bidder. Sometimes, the occasional soldier sees the Lord's light and throws religious fervor into the mix, but mostly, money remains the incentive. Such a solution is costly, however, even for someone as well-funded as Rydzyk. We must remember that our coffers aren't infinite. Otherwise, all these 'crusaders' will quickly turn tail and go elsewhere."

TOR_paying_contractors: "Parish Mercenary Funding"
TOR_paying_contractors_desc: "Our expensive mercenary corps won't just finance themselves. To mitigate the strain on the treasury, each parish will be assigned a specific unit that will fall under its funding, as well as the ability to track its progress during the campaigns. All uniforms and gear will be marked with the corresponding church's insignia and blessed by a local priest. The performance of the sponsored formation will be read out in detail during every Sunday mass, as well as its position on a regularly updated ranking list. If a rival parish places better on the leaderboard, everyone will be openly made aware. After all, some additional funding should help overtake them next time."

TOR_the_lords_disapproval_idea: "The Lord's Disapproval"
TOR_the_lords_disapproval_idea_desc: "While the Torunian government appears as the governing body of an ideologically monolithic population, that is really only true among the elderly. In fact, even slightly lower on the population graph, a variety of different political standings reveal themselves, leftists and the remenants of the Confederation chiefly among them. The state will have to suppress them if they are to maintain stability under the current system."

TOR_the_lords_disapproval_idea_desc: "Father Rydzyk has decided that the §Rleftists§!, insidious and many, although thankfully always conflicted, are the primary danger to his regime. What will follow will most likely be disasterous for them, if executed right."

TOR_the_lords_disapproval_idea2: "The Lord's Dissaproval - Fighting the §8Mentzenites§!"
TOR_the_lords_disapproval_idea_desc: "Father Rydzyk has decided that the §8Mentzenites§!, entrenched and dedicated, are the primary danger to his regime. What will follow will most likely be at least a minor setback, if executed right."

TOR_the_lords_disapproval_idea3: "The Lord's Dissaproval - Taste Of Omnipotence"
TOR_the_lords_disapproval_idea_desc: "Father Rydzyk has decided: There will be no state without him, and nothing will be outside of him or against him. If he is to become a true servant of God, he must be as omnipotent as him. Do not speak ill, the Father-Director is watching. ALWAYS."

TOR_women: "Reject Modernity, Embrace Tradition"
TOR_women_desc: "Traditions hold the wisdom of the bygone ages. To embrace them is to once again accept the virtue from which the world had turned away. Modernity, on the other hand, is a vessel of sin. It leads to the moral decline of the whole population. Many errant slaves of the 'new ways' have returned to faith's embrace. Some, unfortunately, still resist, yet we rejoice at the sight of every convert. A simple life will bring one closer to God, while providing spiritual peace and happiness."

The pain and suffering caused by the recent civil war left their mark on every citizen of Toruń. Families torn apart, homes destroyed, and spirits crushed beneath the tragedy of a merciless conflict. However, we cannot surrender. After losing so much, we deserve a second chance, a chance of redemption, and the possibility of regaining a normal life without hunger and humiliation. We can all accomplish it with the help of Holy Mary and the Lord himself. The sun sets over Toruń, and our broadcast will offer spiritual help to every citizen in need. Poland is not lost as long as we believe."
TOR_retaking_our_voice_desc: "Dear listeners! Even if our success at restoring order to Toruń has been tremendous, there is still one final frontier, one more fortress we must burst apart the walls of, like Joshua at Jericho! What once used to be our main broadcasting center is now corrupted and twisted by sin! Inside, the workers busy themselves with undermining the Christian truth; with destroying what is holy and good within the world! This will not stand, my brothers and sisters! It is time to retake what is truly ours, to reclaim our Promised Land from the pagan menace! Let us then pray for the soldiers who shall perform this great deed... We fly to Thy protection, O Holy Mother of God..."
TOR_beloved_brothers_and_sisters_desc: "Beloved brothers and sisters. The Lord Almighty blessed us with another beautiful day in our historic, sacred city. The forces of godless evil have been, once and for all, cast out and cursed forever. In the forthcoming audition, Father Rydzyk himself shall reassure every brother in faith that our new path is guided by the divine will of God. And let us gently remind our beloved listeners to support this sacred mission with a fitting offering - no gift is too small in the eyes of the Lord; even the smallest, sincere help is a blessing that echoes in eternity."
TOR_accept_maryja_guidance_desc: "Oh, dear listeners. Let this day be a day of remembrance towards the greatness of our great Queen, the Virgin Mary. Her former throne may lie fractured in Poland's demise, but that will not mean she will cease to be our great patron. She gave birth to our saviour, gracefully accepting God's gift upon her and leading to the salvation of the whole Earth with it. Why this specific day? Well, such is because of a proclamation by Blessed Father Rydzyk: that Virgin Mary shall be our nation's great patron on the road to the rallying of all Polish Christians under our banner. I urge all of you to celebrate this wonderful occasion to the best of your ability."
TOR_banish_the_vices_desc: "The holiness of our city lies buried beneath the weight of corruption. What was once consecrated ground now trembles under the burden of sin. Morality has been cast aside, and the hearts of many have grown cold; they have turned their eyes away from God and deafened their ears to His word. We cannot stand idle as darkness spreads. We are called - each one of us - to rise in faith, to reclaim what is sacred, and to restore God’s light to this fallen place. Now is the time to act. Now is the time to return to the Lord. Praise be His wisdom."
TOR_burden_of_our_sins_desc: "As God speaks through the Book of Amos: 'For I know your many crimes and the enormity of your sins!' \nKnow this: the burden of your sins truly grieves and afflicts our Lord. No transgression ever escapes the eye of God; therefore, pray for forgiveness. \nChristian brethren! Not all is lost! \nThe foundation of faith is repentance for unworthy deeds. Yet when a holy priest humbly asks for a small offering in service of our community, you turn your backs. You forget the priests, you spit in their faces, and still they pray for you, asking only for a token of alms. \nRepent, while there is still time! \nOtherwise, the tears of Jesus shall overflow the cup of bitterness, and once more it shall be poured out upon the world—washing away iniquity, and with it, the defiant."
TOR_even_the_holy_desc: "Praised be Jesus Christ!\n Dear Christian brethren, do not forget the sacred role of our priests in their service to God. Consecrated through the holy sacrament, they are exalted in the eyes of the one and only Creator. It is the best among us - the most devout - who enter the priesthood. I assure you, they are humble, diligent, and pure in conscience, with the sole purpose of serving God.\n Yet, humans tainted by the original sin - this includes even the clergy - may at times fall into corruption. To quote the Blessed Father Director: 'Yes, the priest has sinned. He has. But who has no temptations?' - thus defending the unjustly accused martyr, Bishop Edward Janiak. Show understanding for moments of weakness, for they remain nearly invisible within the stream of goodness that your priests, practically always, share with you."
TOR_gone_for_a_price_desc: "But believe me, listeners, not all hope is lost! As we know, God is gracious, and he will forgive us our sins! However, relief from the greatest of sins is not to be found within the often difficult and demanding world of the confessional. Instead, we have devised a new idea: a mass where, just by your very presence at such, your sins will be forgiven! Entry is, understandably, paid, but we will consider paying that contribution an act of self-sacrifice and worship. The funds only go to good causes, after all."
TOR_pardon_disgraced_desc: "Praised be the Most Holy Virgin Mary!\n 'Let he who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone,' Jesus Christ says to us. Devout brothers, take this teaching straight into your hearts, for it has been given to us for our salvation. Remember! Before you judge your neighbor, examine your own conscience first. Do not hurl words of hatred when a priest strays from his spiritual path - for to err is human.\n As the Bible again reminds us: 'The Lord examines both the righteous and the wicked; His soul hates the one who loves violence.' Therefore, do not spread hatred, for that is not the path of a good Christian. True mercy is shown by the one who supports our Blessed Father Director and, when the time comes, by the words of Christ - forgives sins not seven, but seventy-seven times."
TOR_new_code_of_virtue_desc: "Beloved brothers! The rule of tyrants and hypocrites has numbed ordinary citizens into depravity and passivity in the face of sin. Their time has come to an end! Through the intercession of the Glorified Father Director, God shall once again descend into the hearts of His people, reclaiming the place that is rightfully His. A new legal code shall be established, founded upon the Holy Scriptures. \n We vow that it will be nothing but a reflection of the order and Christian fellowship spoken of in the Bible. Yet do not be afraid! For God speaks to you: \n 'The law of the Lord is perfect, it revives the soul; \n the testimony of the Lord is trustworthy, it gives wisdom to the simple. \n The precepts of the Lord are right, they bring joy to the heart; \n the commandment of the Lord is radiant, it enlightens the eyes.'"
TOR_collection_plate_economy_desc: "Good day, and God bless all our listeners! We receive many letters thanking the Father Director for his lax tax policy as the benevolent supervisor of his flock. We are, however, saddened that many of you interpreted Father Tadeusz's charity as a permission to harden your hearts. Indeed, we are disappointed by the meager amount of donations to the Church, despite the invaluable spiritual work it continues to perform for your salvation. We could raise the contributions to prevent you from going down the dangerous path of money hoarders. Yet, Father Tadeusz remembers the great importance of Free Will on the road to salvation. That is why the Radio Maryja editorial office calls only for increased voluntary contributions, at least for the time being."
TOR_safe_under_cassocks_desc: "Brothers and sisters, you've heard about the sin of gossip. Of slinging mud upon your neighbor, coveting attention, or vengeance. Of speaking baseless testimony against one another.\nTake heed, for it's not only you or your neighbor who may be slandered: Our holy Church, its shepherds, indeed the Glorified Father Director himself, are under attack by the misguided without end. Incessantly, they're accused of the worst sins on the planet. Always those of rotten tongues will seek to convince you that our holy churches are dens of vice, or our shepherds are the most offensive heretics, or maybe even schismatics. \n Report the lies, combat the calumny, refute the reckless claims, but above all, disrupt not the sacristies and administrative spaces of our Church. Our holy work is done tirelessly for you, dear Toruń, and to disrupt it is to disrupt our very way of life."
TOR_loyalty_through_sin_desc: "Good evening, listeners. \nMy apologies for disrupting your prayers or interfering with prior sermons. It's unfortunate that the affair bringing me here tonight is a troubling one. I am here because Friar Sebastian Krzyż, a priest within our Church, broke the laws that bind our society and ecclesiarchy together. Crimes such as: embezzlement of tithes, excessive money laundering, and the most heinous case of sodomite rings our investigators ever saw, were all connected to him. It pains me to announce this development, as up until now, even during his dissent against our views on indulgences, he was considered an esteemed member of our Church. \nThe verdict will be announced next Monday. Thank you for your attention, and know I am no more adjudicator than I am a servant of the Lord and Our Father Director. Let tonight remind us that we must adhere to the codes that bind our Church. Lest we endanger all of our faithful."
TOR_expanding_complex_desc: "Listeners,\nWhen Sodom's sins marked it for death, even then Abraham bargained with God whether he would sweep away the righteous along with the wicked. And thus God promised - if ten righteous people can be found, it will be spared.\nBehold the office spaces and summer homes to the west of our strongholds. Know this, listeners: there's not a single righteous person inhabiting those sites. Indeed, we are told there's not a single person there, period. Like Sodom, let our bulldozers and brimstone, too, if need be, consume those decrepit sinful structures, so that new holier buildings can replace them and serve a greater purpose. As our loving Church grows, the space for its work and love will grow too."
TOR_away_from_prying_eyes_desc: "Take heed, dear listeners. Take heed and listen closely. \nTo ensure the undisturbed continuation of our work, and to advance stricture and propriety within our sacred spaces, access to areas used by our leadership and administration will be strictly regulated. Fences will be set up around these sites and structures. Restricted zones will be strictly guarded. No ignorance nor meekness will be an excuse for trespassing, and no donation will wash away the sin of disobedience, only the sweat of your brow. \nGuard the privacy of our grounds with your deeds and reports alike, and God will look as kindly upon you as He looks upon the clergy."
TOR_woe_to_corrupters_desc: "Glory to Christ!\n Most of us still remember the dreadful times of unrest and war in our beloved Toruń. God puts us through difficult trials, testing our devotion to the faith, just as He once tested the biblical Job. Fear not - you shall receive your reward in the Kingdom of Heaven for your suffering. \n Yet the enemy has been driven away, not defeated. Beware of him! For as the Holy Scripture says:\n 'A man that is a heretic after the first and second admonition reject;\nKnowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.'\n Keep your eyes wide open! Among you have crept the ungodly! Everyone who sows scandal, who speaks against the Lord with a deceitful tongue, and all other sinners shall not escape Divine Judgment.\n Report heretics to the authorities!"
TOR_guardians_of_morality_desc: "God bless! \nOh, pray, brothers, for our Savior and His steward, the Father Director, for they bring unto us a new and righteous order! Yet again, we must offer a solemn warning: there are those who, at all costs, seek to destroy all the good we have labored to achieve. \nTo rid ourselves of the godless and other dissenters, a special decree shall be issued, establishing a special, civil group of volunteers named - Shepherds of Order. It shall be both their competence and sacred duty to identify, apprehend, and report enemies of the Church. \nGood and upright citizens - do not be afraid! For as the Bible says: \n'Justice is a joy to the righteous, \nbut a terror to evildoers.'"
TOR_eyes_in_every_window_desc: "Glory to Christ! \nDear listeners! In this broadcast, we wish to offer special praise and blessings to the vigilant Christians who have recently served the good of our community. There are more and more of you, devout citizens, which fills our hearts with great joy and brings a smile to the face of God. \nWe shall pray for a special grace from the Lord for the devoted Mrs. Krystyna from Legnicka Street. She is a person who listens to our radio every day, supports us with generous donations, and, most importantly, this week, while keeping watch over her neighborhood, reported no fewer than 30 CRIMINALS. \nFollow the example of our sister in faith! Anyone can be blessed, and so, KEEP WATCH!"
TOR_install_offering_terminals_desc: "The unfaithful often accuse the Church of refusing to evolve with the times. Their arguments show that those who criticize our holy institution the most are those who attend Mass the least and therefore have no idea what they're talking about. Anyone who stepped into any of the churches within Toruń recently can see clear signs of modernization: new heating, stronger lighting, and, of course, automated offering terminals. Those new devices were made for those who prefer digital financial transfers or don't want to bother the hard-working plate-bearing altar boys. If anything, one could say that the Church goes as far as it could with the digitalization of our services, given the number of seniors in regular attendance. For all faithful confused with the new technology, I recommend the terminals' manual that can be found in the latest issue of 'Nasz Dziennik'."
TOR_sowing_the_grains_desc: "In true monastic fashion, Father Tadeusz promised to use the money he gathered from donations to make numerous investments that will improve the livelihood of the faithful. In the coming days, you can expect new schools, roads, and programs dedicated to providing you with additional workplaces. To take care of the children whose parents will finally gain an employment opportunity, new schools and kindergartens will be founded, filled with educated, caring, and pious teachers and caretakers.\nSincere thanks to all the generous souls who enabled the Father Director to bless us with such good deeds. You are the example to those with hardened hearts, whose redemption we shall yet await."
TOR_alms_for_needy_desc: "In the coming days, a great fundraising campaign will take place. The Lux Veritatis foundation will gather money for the food, clothes, and sanitary items, distributed through the hands of charity workers to those in need. The campaign will help speed up the process of elevating the faithful from poverty, so that we won't have to wait for the inevitable, albeit gradual, rise in living quality resulting from Father Rydzyk's wise investments.\nSome are concerned about the fact that the Lux Veritatis foundation, managed by Father Taduesz himself, is responsible for the charity, as that could lead to corruption among lesser, unfaithful men, but it is nonsense to fear such from the Church. Only the Father Director's oversight can prevent the money from going into the pockets of shady, greedy frauds from some unverified, probably foreign organization."
TOR_mountain_of_gold_desc: "The venomous slander continues! The ever militant atheists attack the Church for seemingly defrauding the believers of money. Again, the loudest voices belong to those who are last to offer any kind of donation to the holy cause, with the wastrels preferring instead to indulge in their basest financial instincts. On the contrary, the donors are more than happy with the way the Church and Lux Veritatis Foundation spend the willingly offered money, as stated in their numerous gratitude-filled letters. But that's besides the point. Our fundraising has never had any stated purpose, and the faithful knew that fact when they made their donations. If the money is the Father Director's to dispose of, how can he then defraud it? His innocence is simply common sense."
TOR_grand_pastoral_visit_desc: "Remember that this time of the year is dedicated to additional pastoral visits. Invite priests into your homes and Jesus into your hearts. Share your worries with the priests, pray with them, let them consecrate your hearths and bless your families. If you know that your neighbor needs additional attention during a time of particular doubt, inform your local cleric and provide him with the full address. Remember, you must allow the priest to be a good shepherd, and it does not matter if you've accepted them during the regular visit time between Christmas and Candlemas. \nIt goes without saying that for their needed task, rewarding them in some, preferably monetary, form is more than just a case of good manners, and it might impact the quality of future service."
TOR_amplifying_our_signal_desc: "Even though our main home is the beautiful city of Toruń, we must not ignore that, before the Fall, all of Poland's most pious citizens used to listen to our station! We hope to someday restore this admirable state of affairs, yet to do so, we must start small. Tomorrow, the main Radio Maryja broadcast will be unavailable. Those seeking spiritual guidance may turn to the pages of 'Nasz Dziennik' instead. However, after the necessary technical upgrades are complete, expect our broadcasts to be louder, clearer, and farther-reaching than before. We hope to reach out to as many people as possible, so that they may experience the joys of faith with us! Hail Mary!"
TOR_round_of_phone_ins_desc: "Listeners! Our station remains known for our outreach to the community: specifically the call-in segments, during which our listeners have the chance to get in touch with the presenting clergymen, speak their mind, and ask the questions their souls most need answered. We are glad to announce that, in the coming days, these segments will begin their revival. We understand that, as of now, not many people in Toruń have phone reception, and that lines to phone booths will be more crowded than ever. However, remember that our listeners don't come only from the city. Quite the contrary. And getting to hear the voices of people outside of our lovely hometown will perhaps broaden our horizons on the conditions in the surrounding states and provide service to those whose hearts yearn for the Lord's light."
TOR_fostering_the_flock_desc: "Dear listeners! As we reach farther and farther in our process of revival, we must emphasize above all: we are an OPEN family, ready to accept new members at all times. Do not close your hearts before the sinful, as even they deserve a chance at redemption through the path of self-sacrifice. The Blessed Father Director has proclaimed a series of additional events and meet-and-greets among the populace in order to further open our arms to those who have yet to find their place among us. If you know anyone in need of salvation, convince them to abandon their sinful lives and give our family a chance. We dearly hope to see you all there. God Bless!"
TOR_human_side_desc: "Dear listeners. Although we have faced scandal after scandal, defamation after defamation, and entire walls of libel thrown against our station and its venerable founder, none of his wayward detractors can deny: the Blessed Father is profoundly easy to like. His piousness attracts us all to continue tuning in to our broadcasts every day, but war and unrest have prevented him from doing that which he most loves - speaking with the faithful directly, no matter how lowly. Seeing the stability returning to the city, Father Rydzyk has decided it is now time to bless us with more public appearances, destroy this libelous slander against us, and show the public a side of our founder they have not seen in a while: his human side."
TOR_keeping_it_in_family_desc: "Dear brothers! Though the situation in the country remains dire, we are starting to see our family reform. People flock from even beyond our borders to participate in weekly Mass at the Sanctuary, even despite the danger crossing the country often entails. The greatest family of all, the family of virtue, is healing and growing! Both returning and new members remain loyal and ready to spread the word! We have emerged victorious from this struggle against the Devil, and things will only look up from here!"
TOR_spread_the_virtue_desc: "Our current situation appears dire. We receive many calls from distressed faithful about their suffered hardships and their closest kin straying away from Christian ways. This is not the first time good Christians have suffered such a fate. We remember the totalitarian persecution of the 20th century. In these trying times, seek comfort in the life story of our venerable Father Rydzyk. The pagan nazi regime killed his mother's husband, Franciszek Rydzyk, who, just like Saint Joseph, protected his spouse and her son. Unlike the Son of Man, Father Taduesz was denied the chance to meet the man his mother loved.\nYet he persevered, still full of faith. He survived the cruelty of the Second World War and the bloody atheistic regime of communists, whose persecution couldn't stop him from spreading the Word of Christ. Emulate his stance, and together with the Family of Radio Maryja, you will be able to weather the storm that came after the Fall."
TOR_castitas_desc: "Praised be Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. Today, we have a very special guest. Today, we'll hear the live words of Father Tadeusz Rydzyk. \n\n'Those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.' \nChastity. It is perhaps the most important vow we take, as it not only applies to specific orders and congregations but to the whole of the clergy. It is also seen as such because, for many, it is the hardest one. To forsake the possibility of having offspring... how many are able to keep such a pledge? No wonder there are some among our ranks who fall, especially in the godless culture of promiscuity that surrounds us. \nI urge all priests who struggle with lust to remain ever stalwart. We don't want to provoke the lustful, unfaithful masses to hypocritically attack the clerics for their minor mishaps."
TOR_mendicans_desc: "God bless all our listeners. Today's broadcast will be hosted by Father Jan Król, who'll tell us about the vows of our Redemptorist congregation. Praised be Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. \n\nNow and forever. Amen. 'Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.' \nWith those words, Jesus urged us to beware the wealth that could lead us astray if we pay it too much mind. That is why, due to caution and through monumental sacrifice, God's servants, such as Father Tadeusz, shun material possessions beyond personal belongings. It is a most noble example that I personally try to embrace and urge you all to imitate as well."
TOR_obedientia_desc: "In today's broadcast, a part of our series regarding the vows of our congregation, my guest will be the Minister of Economy, Sławomir Mentzen, and the topic of our discussion is: Obedience. Minister, what does obedience mean to you? \n\nThank you for your invitation. For me, obedience is a key factor of a well-functioning society. I demand obedience from my children and similarly expect it from my workers, although in a different form, of course. In turn, I, like all citizens, am obedient to the legitimate authority of the state. We all should respect our superiors for their intelligence and competence. They serve as an example for us to do better. They're not unjust tyrants, who should be despised as the left would have you believe."
TOR_new_trinity_desc: "Listeners, when the Anarchy was at its worst, we all prayed for deliverance. And this deliverance gave us our homes back, in a trinity: the Father Director, Father Jan Król, and Sławomir Mentzen. Remember that service to our Church against chaos is always duly awarded: Mentzen is now feasting with our blessed Fathers Rydzyk and Król. In this most hallowed meeting, breaking bread and salt with our spiritual guardians, Mentzen will receive due accolades for his role in securing the city for the Church, and receive a blessing from our illustrious leaders. May such generosity awaken him to settle in his proper place among us beneath our hierarchs, and ward him against envy for his betters, as no layman can ever compare himself to a servant of God."
TOR_savoring_our_fill_desc: "...The Lord made the day of Sabbath for rest, signifying how a week of hard work earns deserved rest. Indeed, if even the Lord took a day off after the creation of our world, then after recreating Toruń from the ashes of anarchy, how much more needing and deserving our priests are of rest, drink, and food to ease their burdens! Yes, there is much to be done. Yes, many of you still suffer. But patience is a holy virtue, as holy as a day of rest. So let us grant our shepherds and most of all our Father Director, rest and nourishment of body and soul, for their tireless labour in getting our fair city this far. And when the Lord calls us for judgment, He will likewise acknowledge when we were tired and needed rest."
TOR_smile_and_wave_desc: "Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,\n\nWith the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the recent talks between Father Rydzyk and Sławomir Mentzen have been marked as a meaningful success for our community of the faithful. Yet let us remember this unshakable truth: the sacred mission of the Church stands above all earthly matters and shall never be swayed or disrupted by any individual or power. The Church belongs to Christ, and it is He who leads it forward. Let us remain vigilant in prayer and steadfast in faith, for the times demand unwavering devotion. In Jesus Christ, we maintain our belief!"
TOR_pint_of_populism_desc: "We extended to him the hand of mercy, offering a path toward redemption and righteousness. Yet he turned away, betraying the grace of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the majesty of God Almighty. That so-called 'beer with Mentzen' is yet another veil for sin and vanity, cloaked in the appearance of friendship and trust. Let it be known: Sławomir Mentzen will come to regret the day he set his hand against the Holy Church. For betrayal of the Word is no small offence, and divine justice does not slumber. What is done in darkness will be brought into the light, and the truth shall judge all."
TOR_feeding_off_their_praise_desc: "What grace! What a blessing. Our priests and vicars step down from their pearly gates to bless us, unworthy, with their presence. The Father Director will take center stage in a procession passing through the city center, while Father Król will embark on a full tour to speak to ordinary parishioners. For taking the time they could otherwise spend on leisure, brothers and sisters, only one thing remains for us: to give praise. Give praise on your knees, give praise prostrated if your backs permit, sing Hosanna to the Highest in gratitude for being in the presence of such divine personages as our leaders. Give praise to the Father, but always in gratitude for our Father Director."
TOR_heel_wayward_son_desc: "Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,\n\nThe overwhelming crisis of faith has found its resolution. Sławomir Mentzen, having come to recognise the gravity of his blasphemous missteps, has agreed to meet with Father Rydzyk and his closest advisors in the spirit of repentance and reflection. This marks a step toward reconciliation, but let it be known: actions against God and His Holy Church shall not be tolerated. No one, no matter their name or stature, is above the law of Heaven. We, as faithful shepherds of the Lord, will stand firm in ensuring that the divine order is upheld, now and always."
TOR_way_of_the_cross_desc: "Shame upon him - for he has betrayed the sacred faith and cast scorn upon the Holy Church. Shame upon him - for his words and deeds have mocked what is sacred and offended the hearts of the faithful. Let it be known: Sławomir Mentzen must not parade his repentance before crowds, but humbly walk the path of true contrition, which leads him, step by step, through the 14 Stations of the Cross. Before each station, he shall reflect upon the suffering of our Lord, and measure his own sins against the weight of that holy sacrifice. Only through such penance, with heart laid bare and pride stripped away, can he hope to seek forgiveness. For the justice of Heaven is not swayed by titles or ambition, and the mercy of God is reserved for those who truly kneel."
TOR_clearing_out_laymen_desc: "Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,\n\nFor years, we have borne witness to the moral corruption festering within the highest offices of our nation. Crosses have been torn from public places, and God’s holy name has been openly renounced. These deeds are not acts of religious indifference, but offerings to Satan and the powers of darkness that prowl the world seeking the ruin of souls.\n\nYet let us never forget: the vain ambitions of men are merely dust before the majesty of God. Only those who renounce worldly luxuries, with hearts surrendered to His will, can truly serve as instruments of His divine purpose here on Earth."
TOR_refill_seminaries_desc: "Dear Brethren in Christ,\n\nAs we witness the growing moral decline of the secular world, one truth becomes ever clearer: Poland needs a new generation of leaders shaped not by ideology, but by the Gospel - leaders rooted in prayer, discipline, and obedience to the Almighty God. \n\nWith His grace, and through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, many hearts, especially among the young, will respond to this call. For it is not through political power, but through the purity of faith and the courage of conviction that our homeland will endure, faithful to God, the Cross, and the Bible."
TOR_back_where_it_started_desc: "Dear brothers and sisters,\n\nGluttony and pride remain grave offences before God, and no man is exempt from judgment. Let us seriously take the warning that comes from the downfall of Sławomir Mentzen. Whoever raises a hand against the Holy Church is not opposing man, but opposing the Lord himself. The voice of the Gospel will not be silenced. We will continue to proclaim the truth without fear, with hearts rooted in prayer and fidelity. God’s justice is real, and His mercy, though great, does not overlook arrogance. Let us remain faithful. Christ is our strength."
TOR_regrouping_in_shadows_desc: "What remains forever true is that our God is merciful. No sinner is beyond redemption, and every soul deserves the chance to receive the miracle of salvation. Sławomir Mentzen stands as a powerful example of this truth.\n\nOnce known for opposing Christian values, he has turned away from pride and rebellion, choosing instead to serve the Lord with humility. He abandoned his hostility toward the Church and began working for God, not against Him.\n\nMay his conversion remind us all: the grace of God can reach even the hardest of hearts. Let us pray for all who remain astray, that they too may return home to Christ."
TOR_serving_god_and_rydzyk_desc: "With humble gratitude, we observe how, under the spiritual guidance of our beloved Father Tadeusz Rydzyk, the community of the faithful is continuously growing stronger and more united. Through his tireless devotion and unshakable faith, many hearts have found direction, and the structures essential to our moral and national renewal have been quietly, lovingly fortified.\n\nThere is no longer confusion or hesitation - only calm certainty and trust in those who truly serve God and Poland. Key places have been entrusted to those whose loyalty lies not in worldly gain, but in fidelity to the values we hold sacred. This is not the end, dear listeners, but rather a blessed beginning."
TOR_ave_maria_desc: "Dear listeners and citizens of Toruń! We have seen great changes in recent times, all in service of our survival against the flood of degeneracy which launched itself upon Poland in the wake of the Fall, and like Noah's Ark, we have triumphed over this terrifying force of nature! Our control has been solidified, our situation stabilised, and today, we tune into this station like always, seeking to learn: what now? And, well... what comes now is simple: it'll soon be time to stabilise and spiritually aid the rest of the region! Now! All together!\nAVE MARIA!\nAVE MARIA!\nAve. Maria.\nGoodnight, listeners. Great things will come tomorrow."

TOR_extending_our_protection_desc: "Greetings, listeners. Today, I would like to begin with a reiteration of what we all already know: the good people currently stuck under Marshall Całbecki's heel are oppressed for their faith and devotion! This is preposterous! These people are begging to be able to worship the True God and are waiting for the day they will be freed by the hand of Father Rydzyk. Even more concerningly, dear listeners, our benevolent foundation has numerous investments in the region, which Marshall Całbecki defiantly refuses to let us administer! We are only doing what is needed, no, what has always been inevitable. Ave Maria, my brothers. Your fight is one sanctioned by God."
TOR_restore_the_resting_place_desc: "Today, we shall remember the legacy of Father Jerzy Popiełuszko. The chaplain of the people's 'Solidarność' movement, murdered by the communist regime, is truly a martyr of our times! While his canonisation has regrettably not yet been confirmed, we will still celebrate him, as is rightful, and to this end, a restoration of his monument and the museum dedicated to his name in Górsk will take place. We shall take him as one of our many patrons and take his guidance to heart. After all, he is nothing if not commendable, and our actions surely align with what he would've wanted for our country. God bless us! Blessed Jerzy Popiełuszko, pray for us!"
TOR_lessons_from_the_martyr_desc: "Brothers and sisters, we may consider ourselves safe from those who defy the Lord, but just like Father Popiełuszko, we will be martyred if we do not take the necessary precautions! The cause of his death is known to us all: the poisonous viper of communism! Every one of us must make sure that communism and other such leftist or godless movements are not welcome within our territory! For your own sake, as well as those who you hold dear, you must make sure that no red thought slips in, no red thought forms, and that none slips out. The hammer and sickle must be destroyed if our existence is to be guaranteed."
TOR_forming_the_berets_desc: "Dear listeners, the one thing that the Fall of the erstwhile sinful state of Poland taught us is that nothing but God is forever. Not even the retirees rest. No person is beyond the ability to serve Him and to serve the Church. Even if one cannot fight, they may still protect the peace. I tell you: The reward in Heaven will be a hundredfold of that which you may receive on Earth, and the greatness of your devotion will shine bright as the stars at God's feet. In every parish, in every post, you may inquire about joining the city guard, the peacekeeping forces, whatever we may need. \nGlory to the volunteers!"
TOR_rations_cooked_with_love_desc: "The Lord commands us to feed those who wander and are hungry. Our very nation baked this view into its hospitality customs: Salt and bread became symbols of welcoming like no other. But if the Lord commands us to feed the stranger, how greater is the need to feed the holy soldier who protects you? To all housewives and grandmothers at home, we thus urge: Keep the soup pots warm and full, so our crusaders may savour their fill whenever needed!"
TOR_crossborder_callins_desc: "Our Church's greatest achievement is not just spreading its reach throughout the nation under the umbrella of Radio Maryja, but also how it outlasted the nation itself. Even now, the entire country is blessed by our radio waves. And even now, people nationwide tune in and listen. \nSo do not be alarmed when those from outside our blessed city arrive and praise the Lord the same way as we do. They are blessed by the same word, the same creed, the same virtue. They are your brothers and sisters, just like the Apostles. There is no Torunian, no Krakowian, no Masurian; there are only children of God, living on one frequency!"
TOR_mohair_partisans_desc: "Faithful, pious brethren! For how much longer will you stand idle while your godless leaders pull the nation further down the path of perdition! They lie to you, brothers. They lie to you that anything that isn't God's love matters. They lie to you that there is no afterlife. \nTheir masters grow richer, but rejoice: They care nothing for them. Ask those living under the occupation whether any single eurocrat wants to even try to improve their lives! So rise up for one last dance with the wolves that sought to replace the Shepherd! Their satanic lords left them behind. Now is the LORD's time, Mary's time, the pious. \nSo make no mistake, we are not asking you to protest. We ask you to fight! Whatever you have by your side, use it against those who are godless; all those who raise the fist against our Church! All those who sought to take the future away from our children! Remind them that the satanic imperialists care nothing for them!"
TOR_load_up_the_offerings_desc: "And tonight, all of our churches, precisely at 10 PM, celebrate the Holy Mass, as a celebration to you, our tithe givers. For when we asked you to forego your worldly possessions, deliver unprecedented offerings in goods and capital to our churches, take up your cross and follow us, you have delivered! \nIn war, a crusade against evil, there can be no expenses spared. To vanquish the devil, give it our all. Whatever you don't have but we need, make. Even tomorrow, evil may yet breach the gates of the Church, but with all our dedication, it shall be the enemy who tastes death and defeat!"
TOR_a_return_from_retirement_desc: "Today's war, today's struggles, the very Fall, they all prove: There is no rest nor guarantee of it. There is only war, and the peace that follows, conquered with the sweat of our brow. Listeners, believe in the fire of faith burning within: God and His will are in you. And so, even when you can't fight, you can very much work: And our finest soldiers each need two civilians behind them, taking up their cross and passing them munitions, food, and medicine. Christ did not carry His cross alone, and neither will our forces. With all our volunteers, our factories will not cease operating even at night, assuring our victory!"
TOR_no_step_closer_heathen_desc: "Enemies of the Church! Kneel in dirt and filth, and beg Mary for mercy. We have none! All listeners of this blessed Radio know your souls inside and out. They see the evil that festers within! \nAnd accordingly, with all that they may reach out, a lead pipe, a stoked cross, a molotov, they'll fight you, enemy soldier! You have lost this war. Your masters have abandoned you! For hundreds of years, they have tried to wipe us out! You dare think you can do it in ten?! We won't give you even one! \nWe are not backward in our attack: We'll carry the fight to you! We won't give you a moment's rest! We'll scream our defiance in your face! We'll stab you, kick you, bite you, cut out your liver, and... *static*"
TOR_renewing_our_contracts_desc: "Praised be the Most Holy Virgin Mary!\nBeloved brothers! We are aware of the current situation - and so should you be! The enemies are all around us! Satan stretches out his vile claws straight toward us and waits only for the opportune moment to strike.\n The good of the Church and the safety of all the righteous demand that we seek professional assistance. Elite military forces shall be recruited to maintain order - the best, the most effective, and with God in their hearts.\n Therefore, we humbly ask for more donations. May God bless the benefactors!"
TOR_a_loving_home_desc: "God bless! \nDevout Catholics! With pride, we wish to announce the implementation of a new social program across the entire territory of our Church! The new initiative, 'Loving Home,' has been created in accordance with the words of truth flowing from the Bible. \nIts purpose is to graciously receive and host in your homes the weary veterans of the newly formed corps protecting our way of life. Show them true Polish-Christian hospitality! They are the defenders of your freedom, your conscience, and above all - of God Himself. Therefore, welcome them humbly under your roofs, sharing with them all that you can!\nThis is your sacred duty, for as the Bible says:\n'Do not neglect hospitality, for through it some have unknowingly entertained angels.'"
TOR_absolution_for_the_butchers_desc: "DEUS VULT!\nMy Christian brethren, a time of toil and blood is upon us. For this is what God demands of us! All devout Catholics who enlist in our armed forces and fight to the last breath with devotion, steadfastness, and the fervor of faith for our righteous cause shall have all their sins forgiven! \nThough this path is not easy, we have been driven to such measures by the schemes of the Devil and his minions. Yet ‘even though you walk through the valley of darkness, do not fear evil.’ For as our forebears teach us: ‘To kill the enemy of Christ is not murder, but an act worthy of glory.’ Moreover, it is both our right and our duty to defend ourselves against the unbelievers. \nHave courage!"
TOR_a_marian_crusade_desc: "Glory to Christ! \nDear listeners, and new arrivals - hear our voice! Our Blessed Father Director, together with the most venerable priests, out of duty and care for us all, declares the Great Crusade of the Most Holy Virgin Mary! \nIn the face of the vile evil that lurks, waiting to strike at devout Christians such as ourselves, decisive action must be taken! \nBrothers! Every recruit is welcome among us, so long as he desires to fight for our holy and just cause. \nAccording to the infallible words from the Bible: as long as the Lord is your shepherd, and the Father Director is His representative on Earth, you shall lack nothing!"
TOR_military_spiritual_complex_desc: "Praised be Jesus Christ!\nPraise the Lord, for He is perfect and cares for us as His children! His mercy is continued here on Earth by the venerable Father Director, who cares for us and watches over our safety! \nThat is why we are recruiting a specialized army of the finest professionals - those who will protect us from the filth of this world! All thanks to the magnanimity of our Father Director! \nPray for our soldiers! \nThe creation of the most perfect army cannot happen without YOUR prayers and your support in the form of regular donations. \nAnd so we urge you - send what you can! These funds shall not be wasted! This is about our future, our faith, and our safety!"
TOR_paying_off_our_protectors_desc: "Glory to Christ! \nDear Christians! Thinking of your collective safety, our Blessed Father Director makes the following proclamation. From now on, individual parishes shall have both the honor and the duty of supporting designated units of our brave soldiers. \nThis endeavor cannot succeed without YOUR support. Therefore, we earnestly appeal for more generous donations to our community. \nDo not hesitate! Every contribution is needed! \nAs the Bible teaches us through the parable of the Good Samaritan, one must aid others in need! \nThe prideful and selfish parishioners who send no donations take the role of those who passed by the beaten man without helping him - thus clothing themselves in sin! \nBut those who reach out a helping hand - MAY GOD BLESS THEM!"
TOR_the_sanctuary_fortress_desc: "God bless!\n Devout brothers and sisters! Be prepared, for the servants of Satan lie in wait for us Christians! Evil fears us - as faithful servants of His Power. \nTo endure these trying times, we must forge strength of both spirit and body, so pray, my brethren, for it is what you need! \nWe hereby proclaim the construction of a fortress the likes of which the world has never seen - in the very heart of Toruń. Its walls shall be impenetrable, yet for true harmony to be achieved, the hearts of its defenders must be just as unyielding! \nLet us gather the funds for our Bastion of the Virgin Mary, which shall defend the world both physically and morally, for the might of these fortifications shall be unconquerable! \n'Be strong and let your hearts take courage, all you who put your hope in the Lord!'"
TOR_business_before_ideology_desc: "While the prospect of a war on the destructive, unholy forces of women's heretical brigades and other such depraved, atheistic forces may seem very attractive indeed, the Blessed Father has decided it so: we must wait! If we are to assault the enemies of the faith with our currently, regrettably, limited might, we risk being destroyed by our opponents' treachery. If we do not act carefully, nothing will come of our righteous crusade... and so he has decreed: first, we must secure the eastern bank of the Vistula, then we will march on the wicked forces located within Kuyavia. Let our righteous army build up its strength first, then we shall deal with the rest infesting the holy lands."
TOR_a_legacy_of_failure_desc: "God. Honor. Fatherland. Such was the motto of the Polish Army, dear listeners. Beautiful words indeed. Yet, sadly, General Adamczak has, with his convenient 'failure' to stop the German invasion, conclusively proven he eats out of the hands of his true masters in Berlin. The fact that he still commands the remnants of his army in the city of Grudziądz is nothing but an abomination in the face of the Lord and all of Poland! But be not concerned, for hope is not lost. Far from it! The Lord will give us the strength to deal with the traitors, no matter what forces they throw against us, and restore holy order to the city. God bless!"
TOR_and_its_spoils_desc: "The fall of the traitorous general marks a new era for both our people and our army! As you see, dear listeners, the remaining divisions, upon their capitulation, left behind valuable equipment, which will be used to reinforce our warriors in their holy mission. While it is nothing compared to what Adamczak once commanded during the initial stages of our rightful defense of Poland's western border, it will surely boost our strength enough to take on future threats. Those who demonstrated exceptional virtue during the campaign will be among the first to receive their pick of the spoils. God generously rewards those who fight in His name."
TOR_rehabilitate_the_generals_desc: "Thankfully, even within the briars, there are beautiful, Marian roses. A few of the generals from Adamczak's faction have seen the light, changing sides and declaring their love for the Father Director's program, as well as their readiness to enforce his will over the region. Rejoice, as their experienced command will be a massive boon to the armies of the faithful currently battling to save Kuyavia from a destiny of sin. After all, war and its unholy consequences are the business of laymen, not the holy, pure priesthood. Our support will be better felt in the churches."
TOR_the_cowardly_hog_desc: "Who is Jacek Hoga, dear listeners? A historian who fails to recognize the true historical enemies of Poland. A militarist too afraid to fight, betraying his ally at the sight of battle. A hunter who fled like prey. A devout Catholic who somehow turned his back on Christ.\nClearly, he lost himself.\nWe, therefore, should not be surprised when a squad of his armed fanatics volleyed shots at our border. Thankfully, no one's been hurt, but we cannot endanger the lives of our brave volunteers or civilians living on the frontier.\nRegrettably, we will have to answer violence with violence and march to Rypin and stop the insurgents."
TOR_commercialize_mega_mary_desc: "Good news, brothers and sisters! The monument of Our Lady, Mother of God, is now finished. Despite the tumult of the Fall, the construction of this work of art never halted, facing only minor delays. The monument has been built in Konotopie, half a day's walk from Toruń, and measures 55.6 meters, towering over any other statue in Poland. It worthily represents the majesty of Mary, without whom we would never be able to achieve salvation.\nIn his virtuousness, Father Director allowed the faithful to admire the monument for free. Provided they do so from further than 150 meters away. Those who would like to get closer will be charged appropriately, so this wonder could be properly maintained. And of course, visits to the balcony atop Mary's head will incur additional payments."
TOR_allies_in_need_desc: "Despite our victory against them, our brave soldiers are being harassed by partisans claiming allegiance to the Ad Arma Foundation. Their foolish resilience is likely caused by our warriors' inability to locate the rogue Jacek Hoga. Anyone who might have seen him or anyone associated with him is obliged to report the sighting to the authorities. Inaction means complicity.\nThis level of difficulty was unexpected by our commanders, even considering the devotion to firearms Ad Arma fighters were known for and the guerrilla tactics they frequently employed.\nFather Rydzyk, in his recent interview, said he suspected a network of civilian supporters and even foreign financing that the insurgents receive, as there exists no rational explanation for our enemies' successes. Despite those disadvantages, we will triumph against them with God's help.\nIn the meantime, travellers are advised to stay away from the territories of the former Rypin and Lipno powiats."
TOR_the_forgotten_corner_desc: "Despite the storms of hostile warlords, the brave garrison of Brodnica still defies the enemies of Poland. Their effort is admirable, especially given their limited resources and manpower.\nThat is why Father Tadeusz will travel to Brodnica to bless the valiant soldiers who remain there no matter what. He will be accompanied by a regiment of the veteran Toruń garrison for his protection. Surely, they will have many a war story to share with their Brodnican compatriots. Our logisticians will also send a copious amount of military rations to relieve them of their hunger.\nAfter the ceremony, the current garrison will be retired.\nAnd we can only hope they will retire for good."
TOR_venom_from_the_pulpit_desc: "We pray for all the fallen and the health of the still-living soldiers as our struggle continues. To the south await enemies more violent than those we faced up north. A fight against them is not only a physical fight, but also a spiritual one. The satanists beyond the Vistula will seek to erode your soul by temptation and the spreading of false doctrine. While our brave warriors will protect us on the front lines, every civilian protects the conscience of those waiting in their homes for the end of the conflict. Report all those who spread heretical and subversive material, and burn unholy books. Attend masses to pray for our success, and remember to pay your voluntary share to our military fund. Do that, and we will prevail."
TOR_the_village_housewives_desc: "Who benefits from creating rifts in our nation, dear listeners? Who benefits from the shattering of the Polish identity into countless pieces, making us divided and therefore weakened? Our enemies, of course - the Republic of Krajna and its allies. They are foreign assets hiding in plain sight. Whose? It remains to be discovered. Don't be fooled by their seemingly noble and innocent initiatives; they were only made to drive you away from Christ. Take, for example, the village housewives' associations. Their form of social activity is targeted directly at you, our female listeners, as a trap concealed by its attractive form. Their declared purpose is to help rural families raise, educate, and organize recreation for children and youth, promoting health care and social security for rural families. All of that without saying anything about promoting Christian values. Ignoring God will twist those initiatives into something evil.\nWe will put an end to this."
TOR_countryside_expansion_desc: "To provide true help with protecting family values and assist in the proper upbringing of local children, many eager redemptorist priests from Toruń will journey to villages and towns recently reunited with our righteous Church. There, they will serve as your parish priests and catechists. We hope their new congregations will treat them with all the deserved respect, hospitality, and understanding, as many of us have only recently received holy ordination. Do not worry. No village will be ignored. Thanks to the deeds of Father Rydzyk and other Redemptorist clergymen, we have an abundance of priests ready to be sent to every locality under our protection."
TOR_the_old_decrepit_church_desc: "Are Archbishop Polak and his institutions a true representation of the Polish Catholic Church? Doubtful. Look around, dear listeners. Poland lies in ruins. Under his jurisdiction, the number of faithful dwindles. It is a clear sign from God to change our ways. A new Flood - that was supposed to be the beginning of the new age. And clearly, Father Rydzyk was supposed to be its prophet, destined to lead the Polish clergy. Instead, in his hubris, Archbishop Polak decided to remain deaf to dialogue and still clings to his comfortable office, dooming us to armed conflict. Come, brothers and sisters. Together, we will tear down the institutions of the Antichurch, saving our congregation from the moral corruption overtaking the world."
TOR_upending_the_hierarchy_desc: "How often have you seen your local bishops, dear listeners? Seldom, I believe. And the archbishops. Even more rarely. How can they guide you? Can there be a shepherd who can guide his flock without seeing it? How can he imitate Christ by searching for the one lost sheep if he's so isolated that he cannot notice the animal is gone?\nCompare this attitude with the Father Director. You can hear him every week, if not every day, in your homes. You're not only his listeners, you are his family. The Radio Maryja family. Can you find this level of closeness anywhere else in the Church?\nIt is clear that the congregational organization should look more akin to Father Rydzyk's vision than to Polak's vision. It is indisputable that Father Rydzyk should be the leader of the Catholic Church within the Polish lands."
TOR_an_old_feud_to_settle_desc: "There is a rift in the Voivodeship. A rift that resembles that which divided our nation. At its source are two clashing forces, each with its own regional epicenter: the force of good has its home in Toruń - the ancient city of piety and science. The force of evil, in turn, has its home in Bydgoszcz - the avatar of evil and overambition that, in its envy, seeks to overshadow its older brother. Expanded by the greatest enemies of Poland - the Germans and the Soviets, its once noble core was trapped by the walls of Protestantism and Atheism. We have to save its and its inhabitants' souls by securing it for Father Rydzyk's supervision. In fact, our forces are already on the move!"
TOR_well_earned_vainglory_desc: "Bydgoszcz has finally been liberated from sinful rule. This is good news for all the faithful living in that den of immorality. Still, for Christianity to take root and undo the decades of liberal permissivism, a series of decisive actions must be undertaken. To recatholicize the city, the Father Director plans to build dozens of new churches. In his foresight, he had ordered the projects' construction even before the military incursion. In our Father's vision, the new temples, as well as the whole city after its seemingly impossible conversion, will be dedicated to the Saint Thaddeus the Apostle, for he is the patron of improbable deeds.\nFurthermore, a new broadcast station for Radio Maryja will be established in the city center.\nAnd, of course, to commemorate the benefactor of all these positive changes, a massive sculpture of Father Tadeusz Rydzyk will adorn the old city square."
TOR_the_sacred_heart_desc: "Despite the atheistic facade, Bydgoszcz harbored many devout Catholics, who were forced to hide, just like the Christians of old, because of the oppressiveness of their liberal regime. One such hero is Father Roman Kneblewski -  a great social activist, who proselytized to outcasts beyond the reach of ordinary priests. You can listen to his sermons every Sunday in the Church of the Most Sacred Heart of the Lord Jesus, something I can't recommend enough.\nDespite his advanced age, Father Kneblewski is still open to taking new responsibilities. Recently, he volunteered as a military chaplain to provide pastoral, spiritual, and emotional support for our brave soldiers. We extend our infinite gratitude to him for this selfless sacrifice."
TOR_daughters_of_satan_desc: "When it became clear we would be the ones to establish order in Toruń, many women escaped the city due to so-called incoming discrimination. In Włocławek, they claimed to aspire to achieve true equality. In truth, they only seek to deceive other women with false promises. As could be expected from the Tribe of Lilith, they dipped their claws into the unborn children. Then they turned the sacred hierarchies upside down, bringing sorrow upon the people. All for the sake of wrongly understood equality. And what kind of equality is that? They call themselves the 'Women's Protection Brigades'. What about the men? How can they even define equality, forgetting about half of mankind? Their vices must be quelled before they try to poison even more naive women's minds."
TOR_relearning_family_values_desc: "The Prodigal Daughters return. Now that the shackles of progressivism have been cast down, we can start reintegrating the lost women into society. It will take some time. Aside from the feminist propaganda they have been subjected to, we can tell that many of the women have never been properly introduced to the Catholic Church. Some reports even indicate a significant portion of them were not even baptised. Truly horrific, is it not?\nFather Tadeusz has already planned multiple courses to rectify that. The project will include a series of classes on practical feminine skills, such as cooking and cleaning, coupled with a comprehensive catechesis culminating in either the reintroduction to the Church or baptism."
TOR_the_good_wives_of_torun_desc: "The reintroduction of misguided women back to the bosom of the Church was more successful than could be imagined. Thanks to the effort of our learned priests, the wantons of yesterday are now humble daughters of Christ. No longer will they be burdened with demanding tasks that are unsuited for the fairer sex. No more dying in the trenches or bending under the heavy weight of political responsibility. They're ready for men to take care of such matters. The women, in turn, will care for family life, as God intended. Of course, to start a family, they will need to find a husband. Alas, the sudden influx of women, coupled with the deficit of men caused by the war, makes arranging marriages more difficult than usual. We urge all willing bachelors to partake in another of Rydzyk's projects - a Catholic answer to sinful dating apps, dedicated not to lustful escapades but to establishing new families."
TOR_kuyavia_sworn_to_mary_desc: "We fly to thy protection,\nO Holy Mother of God;\nDo not disregard our petitions\nborne from our necessities,\nbut deliver us always\nfrom all dangers,\nO Glorious and Blessed Virgin.\n\nThank you, Mary, Mother of God, for you have enabled us to spread your mercy upon the entire Kuyavian land. We, your humble servants, continue to spread your word in gratitude. We offer you this hallowed land, so that it may remain under your protection. May you bless Kuyavia and Father Tadeusz Rydzyk in his quest to reunify the nation so beloved by your Son."
TOR_copiosa_apud_rydzyk_redemptio_desc: "Today's audition, I would like to dedicate to Father Rydzyk - the Triumphator of Kuyavia. May he be blessed with good health so he can lead us in the coming decades. For he is the truest messenger of God on Polish soil. He is without a doubt the spiritual heir of Father Alphonsus Liguori, as he leads the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, the most virtuous of Catholic congregations. Those in need may come to him, and he will sate them as if he possessed the mythical cornucopia. This abundance of gifts and successes is the clearest sign of divine providence over our cause.\nAmen."

We pray for the Father Director's health: May he live until the Judgement Day. Tonight at 9pm, a rosary will be held on air for the Father Director's health. For this week, all evening rosaries are dedicated to the cause of the Father Director's health. Personal intercessions may still be performed during rosaries held at first light - 6am. \nLet it be known that our Leader, Father Rydzyk, remains strong of body. His immune system descends upon any fever that besets him as a Host of Seraphims, and their holy vengeance sears everything in sight. May such purification be granted to all in need!"
TOR_a_theocrats_private_fiefdom_desc: "Having secured God's law and our pious stewardship over the entire Voivodeship, we raise our hands in praise and prayer to the almighty Lord and His Blessed Mother! We have been given the greatest burden of all: to lead the faithful, to guide them, to protect them from the evil that lurks in the shadows, and to ensure that our holy land remains pure and untainted by the sins of the world. This land is our land. God's own fiefdom, which will be ruled with neither fear nor mercy for sin. At last, all hands, young and old, will be dedicated to God alone. \nThis sacramental land, in the darkest night. This sacramental land will become a blueprint for the new Poland, and someday, the whole world! You are witnessing the start of something truly beautiful, dear listeners."
TOR_30_million_silver_pieces_desc: "Although our cause is just, our methods are benevolent, and our desires are nothing but holy, there still remain those, especially outside of the city of Toruń, whose hearts have been overtaken by greed! Those who do not dedicate even a single Złoty to our righteous causes! The Father Director, and God, of course, must be furious about their self-serving ways! And so should you be, dear listeners, for they stand in the way of your prosperity, taking your own contributions for granted. But there is no reason to worry, for soon, all these sinners will bow to His might. They will match, if not outdo, you in their fervor, even if that means we need to intervene to help them find it."
TOR_provincial_broadcasting_desc: "Dear Listeners! We have heard your cries over the quality of the broadcast in the western portion of the voivodeship, and we will gladly answer them! All of you deserve to hear the Word of God, no matter how remote your homes may be. From now on, as the Blessed Father has announced, we will begin the construction of additional broadcasting centres in hubs located all around the voivodeship in order to provide access to the most important program for everyone living inside, and even many kilometers outside its borders! May the whole country hear our wisdom. God bless!"
TOR_gods_word_in_every_home_desc: "We have heard your pleas once more, my dear Brethren. Those historically versed among you may remember that back in the day, the Israelites needed to pool together to afford lambs for Passover. While we approve of the community spirit, with our current prosperity, there is no need to share. So why should our dear listeners need to gather around their neighbors' radios to listen to our program? This is why we're introducing a new generation of portable receiver devices. Cheap and easy to produce, acquire, and set up, these radios will allow even our poorest residents to listen to the holiest radio station on earth. God bless! I hope you will all tune in to our broadcast very soon, in much greater numbers."
TOR_connecting_the_family_desc: "Believers! The Blessed Father has just announced the long-awaited reinstatement of the 'wRodzinie' phone operator service. As we all know, after the Fall, most Polish mobile network operators either fled the country or stopped functioning, which is why we take it as a sacred duty to provide coverage to all our citizens. With this opportunity, you will once again be able to freely contact each other, and, more importantly, make phoning in to our station a far easier task. We welcome your calls. After all, we will not stop until your questions have been heard and answered by our team of liturgical experts."
TOR_tv_trwam_media_empire_desc: "For years before and, to a limited extent, after the fall, TV Trwam was, despite being the holiest television station on earth, really nothing special. This ends today! The Blessed Father has decided on a radical expansion of the station into all kinds of programming! Mass, pilgrimages, christian music, programming for children and adults... and even telenovelas! While some may be skeptical on these changes, particularily on the latter, we would like to remind everyone that the only functioning station most of us have access to is Trwam... so go ahead, sinners. Choose an alternative."
TOR_accessing_their_pockets_desc: "As I have stated before, my brothers and sisters, not everyone is as willing to donate their worldly possessions as our most reverent believers in Toruń. Greed is present in all parts of the voivoideship, aiming to destroy our hallowed structures and spell doom for our great cause! This will not do! The Blessed Father has announced a change to this state of things, but one thing troubles his wise mind: will it be enough to continue to rely on our Church being upkept by willing donations, so often skipped by the sinful masses, or will we be forced by the evil forces of moral corruption to implement a compulsory tithe, which they won't be able to circumvent?"
TOR_a_gentle_nudge_desc: "Dear listeners, it has been decided: there will be no compulsory taxation within our territory, for salvation cannot be forced. Our Church will continue to be financed exclusively by willing donations. Those who refuse to provide them will pave their own paths to Hell. However, the problem of the greedy and vile parts of society not putting forth their share, depriving us of well-deserved funding, still persists. Therefore, we will begin to issue... incentives for our highest donors. Remember, our government depends on all of us doing our best! Don't let yourself be overtaken by greed, and instead let the spirit of sacrifice flow through you!"
TOR_bibles_and_baubles_desc: "Take heed, my brethren! Along with the previously declared policy of incentives, we will also implement a solution which, although corrupted by the forces of greed and avarice, still shows merit: from now on, marketplaces will be established within our churches, selling all one may spiritually need. Available items will include crucifixes, rosaries, various items adorned with the image of the most significant pope of all, Saint John Paul the Great, and holy water containers of different sizes. We hope that these shops will help you live a life of piety not just in our churches, but also in your daily lives."
TOR_a_three_piece_tithe_desc: "Dear Listeners, seeing your defiance and your lives of sin, the Blessed Father has decided it necessary to institute our first mandatory tithe. Of course, the tithe itself isn't large; far from it. Its amount is very merciful to our citizens, but it is indeed a sign of our righteous fight against greed and covetousness. And after all, each one of our neighbours, foolishly claiming to be legitimate successors of the Polish government, has all instituted taxes of their own... why shouldn't we, then? It's only natural."
TOR_parish_financial_registry_desc: "With new times come new changes, although all is, of course, to the glory of our great faith. To all faithful: please report to your local priest to be noted down in your local parish book. From now on, your tax records and taxes must be delivered to your local parish so that the records may be transferred to the parish books, and taxes verified and then approporiatley sent to the government. Nobody would dare to steal the rightful due from a church, and if they did... we're already two steps ahead. Be afraid, tax evaders! Be afraid of the might of the Lord!"
TOR_extortion_incentives_desc: "However, with concerns from priests flowing in, we've decided on something that would make this system fairer for them: a part of the proceeds of these initiatives, they will be allowed to keep as their own, in order to help support themselves in these hard times. This will hopefully also improve the rate at which the faithful give to our righteous cause, because of better motivation of the priests. I would like to reiterate that 100% of the proceeds that go to the government will be used ONLY for the good of our blessed faith. There will be no excesses in these difficult times."
TOR_finish_torun_geothermics_construction_desc: "Dear listeners! \nIt comes to me as a great joy to announce to you all the conclusion of the Toruń Geothermics project! One of the Father Director's larger and more long-lasting investments, the plant will now provide heating and energy for the people of Toruń, all at a discounted rate, thanks to the goodness of his benevolent nature. So allow us to bask in its heat like in the heat of God's burning, sacred heart! Let us not forget that this gift is one from the highest of authorities."
TOR_priest_ceo_pipeline_desc: "With the Blessed Father's takeover of many companies, we must account for one thing: their previous CEOs were creatures stained by Mammon, and therefore are unfit to govern them for even a second longer! Instead, my dear listeners, we will be implementing new governance within those institutions, made up of faithful, unstained redemptorist priests, as should have always been. The registration for ownership positions is ongoing within our seminaries, and we hope to achieve complete staffing very soon! Ave Maria! May Mammon never touch us again!"
TOR_pesa_chapel_cars_desc: "With the growth of our territory, we have noticed an uptick in lengthy journeys by our faithful citizens, and therefore, the Father Director has wisely decided to act. Your train trips will no longer have to be void of worship and sacrifice. From now on, every new train will contain a designated chapel car, with a fair service fee which will, of course, serve as a gift to the Lord in exchange for communion with him. In particular, we encourage the usage of these chapel cars during trips taking place on a Sunday. After all, thou shalt honor the holy day!"
TOR_the_catholigarchic_class_desc: "Over the past weeks, we have seen a rapid increase in ownership of companies, even multiple at a time, by priests and other members of the clergy. While some citizens may panic, I assure all of you: there is NOTHING to worry about! All we are doing is taking our economy away from the forces of Mammon and into our own hands once more! Although you may see the priestly class in charge of considerable ventures, all of it will eventually be repurposed to the benefit of our churches! Now, please do not mind the luxury yachts cruising on the Vistula at this very moment! These are simply unwelcome outsiders belonging to one of our corrupt neighbors!"
TOR_a_liturgical_monopoly_desc: "But who says that only our own citizens can enjoy these gifts from God? The Father Director mandates: We must export! Let us flood the market like the rain of the flood of Noah, drowning our evil competitors in the process! Soon enough, we will become the only important producers of religious goods, and then... err... my apologies! It looks like it's time for an ad break!\nCHRESTEX PRESENTS: A NEW ERA OF HOLY WATER DISTRIBUTION! YOU'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE: THE SAINT PAUL HOLY WATER DISTRIBUTOR.

TOR_secular_authority_ban_desc: "In Most Holy Virgin's name, in the name of the Father Director: \n Our challenges are insurmountable, and any one of us would have faltered long time ago, if not of the providence of the LORD and Father Director. Whenever you're daunted, be glad: Wisdom is the beginning of fear. That is why, there can be no doubt nor even a slight pretend that our earthly profane issues take primacy over the LORD! \n The Confederacy, any one party, any one movement, that does not put the LORD and His Mother first, are hearby banned. Our wise Fathers are working on finalizing the reforms of our statehood that once and for all put even the notion of politics to rest: We are no longer a state, but only a pure, rightminded Church. Our modernist folly, the mirage of Man knowing the right from wrong as God does, calling it POLITICS, IS OVER! Where in the Bible do they mention political parties? Rights? There is only THE LORD and His will. He is our dignity and light!"
TOR_the_godless_pestilence_desc: "Christian brothers! \n Have you ever seen even one roach in your kitchen and thought to yourself, 'my kitchen is clean'? Or left a room covered in dust and proclaimed your cleaning duties are complete? What kind of a housewife would say that or let that be? None in a godly house, that's for sure! \n Likewise we cannot rest on laurels just because sinners are on retreat: Like roaches, they crawl over our territories and contaminate our good works: It is only a matter of time before their evil fouls even our prayers! But fear not, for they cannot befoul our forces, for they know Reason begets doubt, and doubt begets heresy. They will not stop until every sinner repents! For their resolve, let us pray! For their hatred, let us give thanks!"
TOR_parish_defense_militia_desc: "Glory to Christ!\n Brothers and sisters! Let us all rejoice, for once again the enemies of Christ have been foiled. The foresight of our Fathers allowed for arming up the parishioners of several at-risk churches from blasphemers and sinners hiding in the shadows before our light! This bore fruit swiftly, as several rings of sinners and would-be church arsonists were apprehended. As I speak, they are tied up by hands and forced to jog to Toruń for judgement, roped to a pickup Toyota: the LORD would not forgive us for letting them even behold a Maybach! They have been raided by our parishioner militia in their hideout in forest, and the evidence of their intent: molotov cocktails, heater manuals, mosquito wire (arsonist's favorite), is overwhelming. May the cat eat them and the cat be eaten by the devil. To all those in at-risk parishes: Stay vigilant. Train in firearms, check your eyesight, sign up to the parish militias!"
TOR_intensify_bible_bashing_desc: "Do not read the foreign books! Don't know something? Ask the priest! \n Brothers and sisters, have you ever wondered what's going on in the head of your son or grandson? Know this: It's nothing good. What smites every evil from wherever it goes? The Holy Bible, of course! So let us not relent, and take the Bible to the source of the problem. Let them read the Good Word. They won't? It'll fly right in their face. Literally, if need be. A blasphemy is uttered from a stranger's mouth? Remind them of the LORD's commandments and send them flying in their face! \n Books are for reading, not for hitting, but if they don't read, then they will be hit. And if they do read, then they will be hit too, for the LORD's word is a double-edged sword! \n So let us all take up our Bibles and go out to the streets, wherever blasphemy is uttered, and bash it with the Word that was at the beginning!"
TOR_tighten_blasphemy_laws_desc: "Praise be to Jesus Christ! \nWe know what sin is. It is whatever leads you astray, you were told. But I tell you: this, much like in the Old Testament, was a half-truth designed for an imperfect humanity. As we grow in piety and advance on the road to perfection, the truth about sin becomes apparent: It is all that does not lead us to the Lord. \nAnd in turn, our laws adapt, so they themselves do not become sin. It is not enough to denounce those who say they do not believe in the truth of the Bible. To say anything else is blasphemy punishable to the full extent of our God-given laws. To say the Father Director, who led us to this next step on the stairway to Heaven, is fallible in any matter, is blasphemy punishable to the full extent by our God-given laws. To say that the Church is not the only authority in this world is blasphemy punishable to the full extent by our God-given laws. \nWith this, we cleanse the corruption from our hearts. With these laws, perfection is in sight."
TOR_a_schismatics_synod_desc: "As it was told to you, the Revelation of God's Word grew with the people. The Hebrews, following only the Old Testament, eventually scorned it. The Catholic Church, following the concept of Fulfilled Law, wisely embraced the New Testament. The perfection. And then... \n Vatican II. The worldliness. The ecumenism. Some say our Saintly Polish Pope delayed the inevitable: I say it was indeed inevitable. \nThat... \nThat God's Word has been forsaken by Rome. You were told Hell will not overcome the gates of Christ's Church. But fear not: His true Church is now the Redemptorist Church! And in the face of an astray Roman Church, in the face of the wayward Lutherans, or our Eastern brothers in error, the Vicar of Christ is none other than Tadeusz Rydzyk! His is the Apostolic succession! To ever say otherwise is to utter words of blasphemy! Rejoice, brothers and sisters, rejoice and pray to the Mother of God with every breath you take! For there is no Church but the Redemptorist Church, and Father Director is its Prophet!"
TOR_taste_of_omnipotence_desc: "Praise be to Christ and the Father! \nBy their fruits shall you recognise them. And indeed, we recognise the splendor and might of the Church and its Father! Many tried to trample it to nothing, and those masses are now themselves nothing. Less than nothing, for some are inert, when even the dead feed the worms in the earth. \nThe Word of the Father is the word of God. The Father, The Son, The Holy Spirit. As His representative, he speaks with His authority. What worldly power can stop him? What worldly law should last in the face of his splendor? Can such a divinely inspired person err? \nNO! There is no Church but the Redemptorist Church, and Father Director is its Prophet! His will is that of the Church! He is the master of this land and, by extension, of mankind! He is wisdom, he is light! No right, no law, no worldly document can ever constrain him. To imply otherwise would be to break with faith and our God-given laws. Let us pray for His guidance, for this is all we will ever need now."
TOR_the_final_mass_desc: "In mere minutes, the Father Director himself will hold the Holy Mass - truly a most blessed occasion. Though tired after the divine revelations and enlightenment rocking his mortal mind, he still finds the strength to extend his prophetic inspiration to us. \nThank you forevermore, Father Director, for your tireless service to the Church and to God. Time and again, you prove that there is no Church but your Church. Time and again, you fulfill our greatest wishes. Time and again, you connect us to the Divine. God is with you. And soon, with your words, will God be with us."
TOR_extra_omnes_desc: "Glory to You, O Lord! \nAfter an exhausting and sublime Mass, where God's wisdom shone to us through Father Rydzyk's words, filling our hearts and lifting our souls, sinner and saint alike, the time has come for him to contemplate the wisdom and mysteries of faith granted to him from above. To that end, he is now, to our great sorrow, refraining from public appearances. Rest assured that his inspired providence reigns unwaveringly, and as ever, and that any slander regarding his condition is nothing but unfounded. \nLong live the Redemptorist Church, the saviour of Christendom! Once again, we pray for the Father Director this evening at 9pm. All of next month's evening prayers will be dedicated to his health."

With heavy hearts, we announce that the health of our venerable Father Director is not improving. \nHowever, do not be afraid! \nOur blessed Shepherd does not presently appear in public because now, in sacred silence, he prays for the intercession of the Most High Lord. \nYou, too, my dear listeners, should pray for our wonderful Father Director, and may God be gracious enough to hear us! \nYet, here on our virtuous land, much work still remains to be done! \nLet us not fear honest labor, for as the Bible says: \n'Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to attend to your own business and to work with your hands, just as we commanded you.'"
TOR_dont_wake_rydzyk_desc: "God bless you! \nDear Christians! Today, we would like to remind you of the incredible string of successes that, thanks to our community, we have all been able to achieve. Sometimes, I catch myself realizing just how much Toruń has changed - for the better, of course. \nYet as the Bible says: 'Indeed, there is no one on Earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins.' \nThe Father Director is undoubtedly a meritorious and good man, but even figures of such glory have had their stumbles. \nDo not walk the path of hatred, for whoever does so is abominable to the Lord - and 'let him who is without sin cast the first stone.' \nSo accept that you are still in good hands, and we solemnly vow to continue acting in accordance with Divine Law and the love for our neighbor!"
TOR_redraw_the_dioceses_desc: "Christ, have mercy on us! \nDear faithful! A true servant of God always faces a vast expanse of labor and duty - may God, we hope, see fit to reward us for it in Heaven. \nLet us not fear work, for the Bible says: 'All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty.' We are called to toil and bear the weight of duty, for indeed, our nation is still in need of sin being uprooted. \nWe are receiving various reports confirming that certain individuals overseeing dioceses MUST be removed. A thorough investigation and just evaluation of the current local administrators is necessary. \nFor God, for the good of the citizens, and for the sake of the state, we shall tear down the old, corrupt systems to replace them with truly loy… uhhh, competent ones!"
TOR_heathens_at_our_gates_desc: "God bless you and the Father!  \nWolves at the gates. Our enemies, ever sinful and unenlightened, think to surprise us. They amass arms and fighters to trample over the first and last true expression of pure faith that is our Holy Church. But fear not! Our commanders and logisticians are ready. Report to your nearest priest, recruiting station, whichever is closer. There, you will be assigned a new vocation according to your abilities. The Church is preparing for the inevitable confrontation with our neighboring heathens. Let our shield be disgust, our armor contempt, and our sword be hatred!"
TOR_parish_conscription_lottery_desc: "Those who wish to follow me, take up your cross and come with me! \nBrothers, the next Sunday, you may receive an unexpected letter. Inside, there will be directions to the nearest recruiting station. Once you acquire said letter, rejoice in prayer, for you are among those drafted for battle in God's name. Leave your family, your belongings, your worldly concerns behind, take up your cross and follow Christ. Rejoice in battle! Take and give life proudly if that's what is asked of you. And when you reach the pearly gates, with your ancestors and loved ones awaiting with smiles, rejoice again. For you are in Heaven, and you already gave the Father your all!"
TOR_some_sense_of_direction_desc: "Having recognised the imminent threat of war, the Church is perfecting and consolidating its command structure. There are many among our ranks who have already demonstrated their prowess, dear listeners. The ever-unshakeable clergy, the experienced generals of the Polish Army, the faithful soldiers of fortune - each has their regiments and responsibilities. All enforce and defend God's will for the sake of our salvation. Yet, each also has its own strategy on how to best accomplish that honorable task. Our issues are borne not of lack, but the abundance of choice. With the right guidance, however, they may become a host as mighty as the most fearsome of biblical armies."
TOR_in_marys_name_desc: "Lady of Jasna Góra, you are our general. You are the Queen of Poland and the finest mother. Bless your children, lead them, keep our souls pure always. Give our lives to your son, and our arms to victory. \nLady of Jasna Góra, you are our general. You are the Queen of Poland and the finest mother. Be our shield, our aegis. Be the shelter from harm. Be our destination, when the holy war calls. \nLady of Jasna Góra, you are our general. You are the Queen of Poland and the finest mother..."
TOR_the_promise_of_prosperity_desc: "'Man shall not live by bread alone'... such wise words, uttered by our Lord and Saviour. His words are always true. But we must remember they are often true in metaphorical ways. We have noticed your piety, your willingness to sacrifice yourselves in the name of our nation and religion... and that is good! However, we have also noticed another thing: your lives are often ones of complete misery and sadness! While true accomplishment will be present in Heaven, that much is true, that does not mean our material lives have to be ones of complete poverty! Multiply your talents, folks! And perhaps then, not only will your lives be better, but you will be able to give the Church even more!"
TOR_an_ode_to_mammon_desc: "Brothers and sisters, while many among our populace have wisely embraced our new teachings, some still reject them, viewing monetary wealth as antithetical to our cause... This couldn't be further from the truth! Wealth is entirely compatible with good Christian worship, as you will soon see! Who cares if a priest has 7 fancy cars, one for each day of the week, if he gives great sermons about self-sacrifice and giving up our pride? Absolutely no one in their right mind, I tell you!"
TOR_father_director_charity_fund_desc: "We know that, despite our encouragement, not everyone is as well-off as they could be... yet, thankfully, this injustice will be fixed right this second! We hereby announce the Father Director Charity Fund, dedicated to helping the needy and lifting them out of poverty, so that they can contribute to society just like their more wealthy brethren! As our Lord God proclaimed: 'blessed be the crying, for their spirits will be uplifted!', and thanks to the generosity of the Father Director, it will be so!"
TOR_even_in_death_desc: "We hear your saddened wails, we hear how you suffer under your poverty... we truly do. However, true virtue comes not from handouts but from successfully battling through your personal difficulties. Tell me, my brothers, who deserves the funds in such a trying time, if not the Church itself? Perhaps, in the future, we will be able to provide for you, yet that state of being has not yet materialized. For now, your struggles are your own. The Father Director apologizes thoroughly for this state of things. We promise, the future will be brighter. It will always be brighter. We promise."
TOR_ask_and_you_should_receive_desc: "While the Father Director's methods are just, especially considering the cause, we must also think, as before, of the material conditions of our citizens... which Father Król will more than readily help with! Today, all registered parishioners will be able to freely contact the station and state their and their community's financial needs. Should your requests be within reason, he will personally grant you advice, monetary help, and write down the investments that will most benefit our whole congregation. Don't be afraid to call in, folks! You will not want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!"
TOR_routes_of_st_jacob_desc: "Today, we would like to begin with a little informational segment for our listeners: the blessed land of Kuyavia finds itself at the intersection of several Routes of Saint Jacob, which are, as you likely already know, the most significant pilgrimage paths in all of Europe. We would like to announce, with that fact in tow, that we will be making sure that no pilgrim goes unfed within our lands, finds himself without a place to stay, or, even worse, without the possibility of purchasing various religious goods and trinkets for their journey! After all, such an endeavour is a difficult one, especially nowadays, and one must receive as much assistance during it as possible, if they are to make it through!"
TOR_our_spot_on_the_pilgrimage_map_desc: "Dear listeners, while flocks of pilgrims already pass through our region - you may have even seen them yourselves - there is no need for the blessed lands of Kuyavia to remain only a stopover point, rather than the destination. The Father Director, in his wisdom, announces a project that will attract visitors from all corners of the Earth: a generous investment into our religious institutions and additional facilities that will turn them into an attraction for not just the most devout, but for entire families. Soon, our territory will be regarded as the most renowned pilgrimage spot in the country. And every Złoty spent within our borders will fuel our righteous cause."
TOR_just_another_product_desc: "We now move on to a sponsored segment, charitably enabled by a donation from CassockShare, the largest retailer of religious clothing, proud to present its new summer collection. The monument of Mary in Konotopie has been expanded to feature a brand new viewing platform, capable of hosting 50 visitors at a time. Tickets may be purchased from the ticket booth or on the monument's website. Brothers and sisters, have you ever wished to meet Father Król in person? Of course you have. Now, with the code 'Rydzyk', first-time visitors will receive a 50% discount. Book while the offer lasts at meetjankrol.tor!"
TOR_monastery_hotels_desc: "We all know of Christian hospitality, my brothers and sisters. Yet our churches and monasteries have for too long been unwelcoming to visitors. All of the faithful deserve a place to sleep, a full plate to eat, and spiritual comfort on their journey. Those among us not involved in weekly evangelization shall instead work to extend that hospitality to the wider community. The home is not only our own, as it belongs to God and the Universal Church. We cannot selfishly keep it ourselves."
TOR_the_waiting_game_desc: "In terms of the economy, the editorial team is glad to announce: we have gone through yet another economic miracle! Our coffers are overflowing, ready to provide for our future plans, and there is no end to the funding coming in every day, thanks to the devotion of people like you! God bless you all, for with your spiritual growth, you are building a new Holy Land! In other news, the Father Director is doing... well... erm... yeah? Oh, alright... In other news, the Father Director is doing great!"
TOR_a_vow_of_silence_desc: "'Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise; when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent.' \nI begin today's radio sermon with a rather harsh quote from the Book of Proverbs. Who wants to admit to being a fool? Who wants to set for himself a bar that low? In moments of doubt, remember the words of Saint Paul: 'Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise… for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.' \nSometimes things are not as they seem. Sometimes you may want to speak with the eagerness and rush of Saint Peter to expose evil. Remember, someone might manipulate you to spread false Gospel, rumors, and lies among the unsuspecting populace. Think twelve times before you want to uncover someone's secret. Usually, it's best to stay quiet or immediately contact those wise and responsible: priests or other virtue enforcement officials, depending on the nature of your confession."
TOR_divine_exaltation_desc: "The day of the Lord is at hand! We have our pious priests to thank for preparing us for the coming storm, especially Father Tadeusz Rydzyk and Father Jan Król - the Moses and Aaron of our times! Indeed, as you could hear in the last few weeks, the prayers for Father Król increased exponentially, but that does not mean this forces a wedge between the two. \nJust like Moses and his brother Aaron, Fathers Tadeusz and Jan are inseparable. The first brought the Israelites to the Promised Land and gave them the commandments that the Lord had provided for them. In turn, Aaron and his line upheld the Law and were the shepherds for future generations. They make one whole, and anyone who would attempt to divide them will find this destructive aim to be futile."
TOR_embrace_the_darker_ages_desc: "As the Church of Kuyavia remains undivided, we offer our prayers to Father Tadeusz - the Director of our souls! No matter the state of his health, whether he dies in 4 or 40 years, he will continue to watch over us from Heaven. We pray that his vision for humanity will remain unchanged, just as he intended. We will emulate him by following the example set by his humble past. Thanks to his teachings, we will remain pure and faithful. True fools of Christ. \nWe will be the guardians of the Redemptorist legacy, protecting it from the myriad of heresies that will seek to corrupt us."
TOR_miracle_factory_desc: "In these trying times, marked by the declining health of the Father Director, numerous supernatural sightings have been reported. For example, after a prolonged drought, the farmers' desperate prayers have been answered with rain for three days and three nights straight. The farmers were afraid that such fierce rainfalls could overwhelm the plants and destroy the crops. On the contrary, the vegetables bloomed, and wheat grew higher than ever. After the torrent had passed, people noticed a rainbow reaching from the sky towards one of the churches of Saint Thaddeus, the one that was newly erected on the orders of Father Tadeusz Rydzyk - a clear sign of divine providence over our beloved Father Director. Theologians expect more miracle-like events associated with Father Tadeusz in the future."
TOR_joining_the_pantheon_desc: "When Jesus committed his spirit into his Father's hands, he entrusted his mother to the protection of his beloved disciple - John. Just like in the past, the Mother of God, in her infallibility, needs earthly protection from those who would want to attempt to tarnish her glory. It is clear that Father Tadeusz is worthy to take the mantle of the Beloved Disciple of Jesus. He's the new John the Apostle, ready to take care of Mary and her legacy, having already glorified her name through his radio program and sermons like no man before him. \nSuch a spectacular achievement will need a worthy commemoration. A new statue of Father Rydzyk will be raised next to the already existing statue of Mary. Both statues will be fitted with slates containing Bible fragments to emphasise the continuation of tradition. 'Woman, behold your son' for Father Tadeusz and 'Behold your mother' for Mary."
TOR_a_new_vision_for_the_church_desc: "As the Church in Toruń remains undivided, we offer our prayers to Father Król - may he continuously provide the Father Director with good counsel to inspire him to pursue modern solutions to today's problems. May his ingenious investments benefit us all. May his flair for technology allow Radio Maryja to reach the furthest corners of Earth, igniting the flame of faith in people's hearts. \nWith such a wise advisor to Father Rydzyk, we can look into the future with comforting confidence, sure of our safety and the growth of our congregation, knowing Father Jan Król can navigate the future like a true King."
TOR_breaking_the_ceremonial_desc: "The sin that is most prevalent amongst the clergy is pride. It manifests in priests who hold the churches' ornaments, the soaring prolixity, and dusty habits in too high regard at the expense of the believers. The congregants find the repetition and stiffness of the Masses unapproachable. Father Jan, in his wisdom, suggested introducing some variety to our Sunday gatherings. Some priests gifted in musical talent may try to enrich the homilies with a guitar. Alas, not all of the clerics were blessed with such abilities. But everyone can introduce some basic creative drama or bring cassette players with some lively music. If some of the priests turn too old-fashioned to go with the times, they are encouraged by Father Król to ask their altar servers or even regular parishioners for help."
TOR_no_false_messiahs_desc: "Praised be Jesus Christ, dear listeners. In today's broadcast, I would like to broach the subject of the doctrine. The saints. Some of the enemies of the Church accuse Catholics of worshipping beings other than God, like saints or the Virgin Mary. Catholics indeed pray to Mary and the saints, but it is not because of worship, but rather as a plea for intercession, as we would for fellow Christians living on Earth. We especially value saints because of their closeness to God. \nWhile the critics of the Church are clearly in the wrong, in our humility, we must acknowledge the speck in the eyes of the members of our congregation. Regrettably, with their overemphasis on saints, some practitioners seem to forget about God. Be mindful not to fall into idolatry. \n'Thou shalt have no other gods before Me'\nRemember, no human deserves to be worshipped."
TOR_clearing_the_name_desc: "How immeasurable is human ungratefulness! Despite Radio Maryja's evangelizing activity, there are those who claim that we destroy the Church's image. \nDespite the charity done by Lux Veritatis, there are those who accuse the organization of greed. \nDespite the priests' willing participation in our pastoral service, there are those who accuse them of cynicism. \nIt's no coincidence that those voices are getting louder as we are taking our first successful step at reunifying our homeland, and our shepherd is in such a dire state. It is clearly a coordinated effort aimed at thwarting our noble mission. As agents of foreign interests, those liars must be silenced by any means necessary."
TOR_a_letter_to_the_faithful_desc: "Dear listeners, a dark day has come. Father Tadeusz Rydzyk has passed to the Bosom of Abraham. Before any words of prayer or condolences, let me read the letter Father Director wrote on his deathbed: \n\n'Brothers and sisters in Christ,\nWhen you read this, I will no longer walk with you through this vale of tears. It pains me deeply to leave you when there is still so much to be accomplished. It would seem that in the eyes of God, I have done enough good in this world, and it is time for my well-deserved rest.\nSome may fear that my successors will not be capable of continuing my mission, alas...'\n\nI beg your pardon, I am receiving an emergency call.\n...\nWhat do you mean 'He's still alive'?"
TOR_mourners_and_believers_desc: "Glory to the Lord in the Heavens! \nDear brothers and sisters! \nAttention! There is no reason for fear! \nI repeat! There is no reason for fear! \nThe blessed Father Director is alive! Do not mourn him, for your sorrow is unnecessary. He is alive! \nYet we must admit, in a certain sense, our hearts are moved by the sight of thousands of the faithful, ready to give their time and spiritual strength in collective reverence for the Father Director. \nTruly, your devotion reaffirms the sense that God is among us! He guides the people of Christ and, through their actions, expresses Himself in this world! For where else could such love for one another come from?\nAs the Bible says: 'Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.' \nBut do not mourn - for he lives!"
TOR_blessed_be_the_trusting_desc: "God bless you! \nDear faithful! This time we shall begin with the words of the Gospel according to St. John: 'Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.' \nWith sincere intent, we urge you to truly understand this passage. Sadly, some among you - the faithful - have forgotten what the holy word of a priest means. You mislead yourselves, placing faith in mutual falsehoods while ignoring the truth spoken by your clergy! \nThe Father Director is alive, and blessed are those who believe in this truth! \nTruly, some show vile selfishness and indolence in doubting the Father Director. Our Shepherd is in solitude, devoting himself to contemplation and prayer! \nYES! To all you doubters! \nIf only you could comprehend the closeness in which Father Director now dwells with God, and what he sees - what ordinary man cannot perceive - you would not so easily hurl deceitful words!"
TOR_the_deathbed_audience_desc: "Inspire us, O Christ! \nDear faithful! Very soon, you shall be granted the great honor of seeing the venerable Father Director in all his splendor. \nYet we are saddened by the fact that many of you have gone astray and have begun to resemble the biblical Doubting Thomas. \nCertain madmen and subversives have spread false information about the supposed death of the Father Director. \nShame on you! \nOnly God can now forgive you for such a grave sin against His glorious Servant. \nTo calm the doubters, the blessed Father Director has decided to appear before you - the faithful. \nYet we warn you! For it is the soul that makes the man, not his fragile body. \nOur Shepherd is facing some health issues, but he remains fully capable - especially in mind and spirit. \nJudge not, lest ye be judged!"
TOR_ascensio_desc: "Lord, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. \nBeloved brothers... the inevitable has come to pass. We openly confirm the sorrowful news that our venerable Father Director has departed for good - he is no longer with us. \nMourning has inevitably reached even us, for such a magnificent figure has truly left a void with his departure. Without a doubt, this is an immeasurable loss for humankind and for the faithful on Earth. \nYet the Bible offers us comfort. This is only the beginning of the journey - and now, for his years of service, Father Rydzyk shall surely taste the delights of his well-earned Paradise.\n'He died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor […]' - thus let us remember you in our hearts. \nAlways cheerful, honest, just, helpful... a true Christian of his time... \nLet us pray for him... \nAMEN!"

unification.80.desc: "At noon today, at a lavish unveiling, statues were raised in each major Kuyavian city. They all depict one man - the great warrior of the catholic faith, the Lord's chosen conqueror, the protector of Poland. Emerging victorious from the brutal struggle of the Toruń anarchy on the backs of his thoroughly devout followers, Father Rydzyk spread the pious teachings of Radio Maryja across the entire voivodeship. With a growing hoard of financial contributions from even the most destitute among the faithful, his state boasts resources most warlords could hardly dream of. From his evergrowing complex, his leadership undisputed, the aging priest now drafts plans to extend his influence to the furthest corners of the nation. Yet beyond this ascendance, keen-eyed watchers have spotted a significant change - a sickly, pale appearance and a drastic reduction of public events. If the speculations prove true, and the Father Director's days may soon near their end, will the empire he built survive without his guidance?"

The forces loyal to the emerging new sect of Christianity salute and pray to the spirit of Father Tadeusz, whom they claim to be their saint. Despite the excommunication from Pope [PAP.GetLeader], the followers of Radio Maryja remain adamant about the truth of their beliefs. Led by Jan Król, who bases his legitimacy on the claim that he can communicate with the soul of deceased Tadeusz Rydzyk, the zealots burn the churches of the priests accused of heresy, trying to submit the more fearful to bend their will and consciences. Local civilian governments are slowly being abolished. In its place, newly and haphazardly consecrated parish priests are supposed to govern and watch over the local population.

He calls Warsaw a new Babylon that must be purified before it becomes a capital worthy of reborn Poland. He suggests starting with the destruction of the godless idol that is the 'Palace of Joseph Stalin', as that would be an adequate signal for the heathens to convert, before the day of reckoning starts. It remains to be seen if such a harsh regime will survive in the liberal Warsaw, inhabited by many religious minorities as well as atheists.

A religious euphoria permeates the believers as the transmissions of the ritual are spread to the furthest reaches of the country and beyond! The soul of Poland is about to be transformed as the cult of Tadeusz Rydzyk outshines all the other saints, not to mention the Three Divine Persons.

Now that the deed is done, Rydzyk's heir apparent has to step out of the shadow and become a new face of Radio Maryja. His success is not guaranteed, as the death of Rydzyk caused mass religious hysteria and a bottom-up movement that may be hard to control.

Conquered cities have been heavily looted, with everything of value hauled back to the cleric's ever-growing complex, yet even this wouldn't prevent another fund-raising drive from among Toruń's vulnerable faithful, as Król seems intent on milking them of all remaining worldly possessions. And though outside his immediate zone of control, the priest's influence remains limited, the state's rhetoric and service not to the ideals of God, but rather of Mammon. Indeed, priests loyal to Król put an unusual emphasis on the importance of worldly goods, and their masses diverge drastically from the traditional Roman Rite.

As Król's influence increases, so too do his expressions of decadence, as reports indicate that his Toruń headquarters have since been turned into a den of greed and depravity, or as Król likes to call it, a celebration of spirit and body that God views favorably.\nNow, the army of the faithful, unfazed by the corruption of the false prophet, prepares for the final showdown for the soul of the country."

It shouldn't be at a surprise as Radio Maryja's regime accustomed the populace to the combination of Catholic morality with shrewd entrepreneurship. Mentzen, being aware of that, stylised himself as the spiritual successor of Father Rydzyk, although more moderate than the priest from Olkusz. Selling similar right-wing positions in a more secular package proved successful to younger conservatives. Furthermore, a less regulated economy independent from central institutions, such as the Lux Veritatis foundation, proved popular among small businessmen. Another asset: the militarization of society by promoting gun culture resulted in an increased number of devoted volunteers ready for the front.

Nobody's coming. - The senior operator burst in with a mix of disappointment and boiling anger. - Can't you see we're out here alone? \n- Well, unlike you, I'm not just going to sit here and wait for my turn to die. - He turned back to the microphone. - Station 100... \n- Mhm, sure. If you want anyone to hear you, get back on the civilian airwaves. Give these fanatics a piece of your mind while you still can. - He gave his colleague a visible smirk. - As for me, I'd rather die in peace. Try not to bother me too much while I relax, alright? \n\nWith the time running out, Stanisław adjusted the transmitter's frequency and straightened himself in his chair. With increasing volume, the noises of the battle raging below broke through the filters, and the occasional stray bullets flew unpredictably around the room. Determined to make a final impact, he addressed his enemy's indoctrinated supporters. \n\n- If you can hear me, please listen. You've been lied to. Deceived. Tadeusz Rydzyk is not the pious man he pretends to be. I know it, I know him. I worked under him. You have no idea just how much he hides from you. Please, this is not an attack against your faith. Rydzyk has none. He only serves himself. He only wants your money, your devotion. We have failed. Only you can stop him. I will be gone soon, but please, you have to find a way to..."

We have received multiple complaints that the familiar waves of the one true Christian network have been turned into a den of atheistic propaganda, lies, and depravity. Rest assured that the matter has been thoroughly resolved. \n\nA muffled voice was heard in the distance, and the priest turned away from the microphone, forgetting to properly silence it. - What do you mean he's still moving? Then just shoot him again, damn it. Why do I have to tell you how to do your job? \n\nHe poised himself and returned to the broadcast. - Ahem. From now on, we will make every effort to earn back your trust so you can once again comfortably tune in to the Catholic voice in your households. And now, as an appeal to the Lord to deliver us continued stability and help us move on from this difficult time, brothers and sisters, let us pray:"

TOR.4.t: "Pride"
TOR.4.desc: "- Ave Maria, gratia plena... \n\nA booming voice resonated around the walls of the empty sanctuary. Though normally open to visitors from all walks of life, the building had been emptied for a moment of private contemplation. \n\n-Dominus tecum... \n\nThough his turbulent life didn't often allow him an opportunity for quiet reflection, Tadeusz Rydzyk was long overdue a chance to confide with his divine patron. \n\n- Benedicta tu in mulieribus... \n\nKneeling on the cold, hard floor in front of a personally commissioned icon of the Virgin Mary, he shivered from the freezing air of an early April morning. \n\n- et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus... \n\nYet, undeterred, he persisted, continuously repeating the same prayer. \n\n- Sancta Maria, Mater Dei... \n\nThe same one that started it all, back in the aging halls of a provincial seminary. \n\n- ora pro nobis peccatoribus... \n\nThe same one that led him to power and wealth he could once seldom fathom. \n\n- nunc et in hora mortis nostrae... \n\nNow that his influence was no longer merely spiritual, he once more prayed for guidance, recognition... \n\n- Amen. \n\nFor deniability, before himself and those who revered him, that he served anyone but his own interests and vices. \n\n- Mary, I come to you in this time of great uncertainty. All my life, you have led me, and all my life, I have served you. To you, I owe everything I have built. With full gratitude, I accept your blessing to guide this country through peril; to rebirth it in the fires of faith. Just as I have accepted your mission when you first chose me, a sinner, for your greatest evangelist. And yet, you always knew perfectly that among all your devotees, only I could serve as your champion. Mary, your name resonates in the prayers of millions. It unites this city under one holy banner. Soon, under my leadership, the whole country will worship you in unison. My holy patron, it is not often I ask for anything in return for my service. I expect no reward except for the temporal. And yet, I must ask you, for all the souls I have saved, for the renewal of faith I have brought, that when the day of my judgment comes, you will look not at my personal moral failings but at the undeniable good I have brought upon this world. For Mary, I may not follow every one of your guidelines; I may live in opposition to the Commandments, but without me, we all would be condemned to an eternity of torment. For this, I know none on this Earth are more deserving of a special place in Heaven. Until then, I hope you will intercede on my behalf just as I do on yours."

TOR.5.t: "Greed"
TOR.5.desc: "Fort I, or rather, what little remained of it after the prolonged siege, provided the perfect base of operations for a lost cause. Though the writing had been on the wall for a long time, when surrender would mean death, no last stand is too hopeless. At that point, you’ll do anything to prolong your suffering for just another few days. Thus, Zaleski’s final handful of loyalists fought to the man against the fanatical tide, awakening the ghosts of the old Prussian garrison to witness yet another bout. Even now, in the crumbling tunnels of the structure, it felt as if gunfire echoed just out of reach. \n\nArtur despised the cleanup duty assigned by his superiors, perhaps even more so than his other colleagues. For the life of him, he could not understand why they were sent out every day to scour the empty pathways, but the silence, broken only by the soft tapping of water dripping down from the cracked ceilings and his rhythmic, unsteady footsteps, was enough to ensnare him in an unsettling aura. Though logically, the task was a far better posting than frontline duty, no matter how he tried, Artur just couldn’t shake the feeling that something, or someone, was about to lunge at him at any moment. With a torch in his hand and a makeshift rifle strapped over his shoulder, each portion followed a similar script. Empty. Empty. A few cobwebs. Empty. Structural collapse blocking the pathway. Empty. Crates. Empty. Hold on... crates? That was a new one. \n\nPulled out of the uneventful, yet tense, routine, Artur diligently stepped back to check on perhaps the sole somewhat interesting thing he might find all day. Tapping the containers slightly as if fearful that whatever limb makes contact might end up getting blown off, his eyes nearly dropped at the sight of a small fortune, neatly stashed up to the brim, most likely whatever funds could be smuggled out of the city treasury by the defenders. After a quick moment of disbelief, he vowed to do the only thing his values would allow - return it untouched to his spiritual patron. \n\n- Nice find, soldier. I’ll take it from here. - A hoarse voice spoke from the opening of the tunnel. \n-  Oh, Father Król. I... didn’t expect to find you here. There’s no need to burden yourself. I’ll take this directly to the Father Director. - How the priest managed to appear at the exact moment money got involved was beyond Artur’s understanding. \n- No, no. - The cleric laughed politely. - I don’t think you will. Not all of it, at least. \n- But... orders are to report any findings to Father Rydzyk... \n\nThe surprising amount of backbone displayed by the soldier irritated the priest. \n\n- I’m sure he has more than enough already. Not that he can complain. - He pouted. - Don’t you think we also deserve a little bonus? \n\nArtur looked at Król wide-eyed, astonished at the audacity. \n\n- How about this? Deliver a quarter of the money to Rydzyk. Take 5% for the trouble and silence. I expect to see the rest at my residence by tomorrow morning. Oh, and if you try to skim me for even a single grosz... well, you don't want to know what happens then. Dismissed. \n\nWithout waiting for a response, the priest headed out as abruptly as he appeared, lost in thought:"

I’ll be with you shortly. \n\nThe practiced, reassuring smile and friendly demeanor of the receptionist were always enough to melt most of Lidia's tension. After leaving her fur coat on the hanger standing in the corner of the lobby, she sat down on the padded sofa and reached for one of the mints on the coffee table in front of her. A few minutes later, the assistant joined her with a neat binder in hand. \n\n- Alright, so I know this may all seem a bit overwhelming, especially if it's your first visit, but before the... appointment, we just have to take care of the formalities. \n- Actually... I've... uhh... been here a few times already... - the woman corrected, flustered, sinking into the couch, having felt the full brunt of the shame. \n- Ah, my mistake. We’ve been getting a lot of traffic lately. I get the faces mixed up sometimes. - The monotone, overly excited pitch seemed not to react to the information. - Well, that saves us a lot of paperwork. Phew. \n- Mhm, let's just get it over with. I'm not exactly thrilled to be here, you know. \n- Certainly! - She began laying out the dozen-or-so separate documents. - So, we've got the standard: non-disclosure agreement, note of indulgence, health form... you know the drill. Oh, and by the way, they finally finished building that pharmacy by the academy. Go there once you're done, and Robert will give you all the pills you need. \n- Are you sure? - Lidia spoke frightfully. - They were pretty adamant during yesterday's mass that it would be an unforgivable sin. Murder of the innocent... \n- Look, I've cleared it with Father Rydzyk. He doesn't want any... unintended consequences of your interactions. Don't worry about it. I'm sure he has his reasons. If he says it's okay in this case, then it has to be. \n- Uh-huh... surely... - she tried to comfort herself, half-heartedly trying to accept the backward logic as she methodically signed each document. - And what is this supposed to be? \n- Ah, that's a new one! - The gleeful expression now really out of place. -  It's a list of do's and don'ts for... - She struggled momentarily to find the most diplomatic way to put it. - your... session with him today. \n- That's... a lot. Like, actually a lot. I don't know if I... \n- Yeah, I... couldn't stomach even reading through it. I imagine it feels far worse having to actually do that. - The assistant's professional attitude crumbled under the weight of human empathy. - If it's any consolation, I doubt he'll have the strength to get through most, if any, of the list. \n- Uh-huh... - Somehow, the attempt to calm her down didn't particularly help much. - For my own sake, I really hope that's the case. \n- So do I. Just umm... take your time if you need to. I'll take care of the paperwork in the meantime. - She turned away, ashamed of herself."

TOR.7.t: "Envy"
TOR.7.desc: "- Why? Why always him? - The thought stirred in Przemysław Wipler's mind as he angrily took another swig from the half-empty bottle. Bitter, overrated, just like everything associated with Mentzen. Not even his beer was different. At least it hit well enough to drown his sorrows. \n- What does he have? Clearly not the looks or any real charisma. Oh, and definitely not the politics. I AM THE ONE WITH THE ACTUAL POLITICS. - Wipler banged his fist against the side of the table. - So what, he just gets to ape the best of my ideas and twist them into a bunch of empty catchphrases? And now he's this big man, all proud on some massive stage, giving lectures to brain-dead kids who don't know any better while I sit here in this dump? I even had to thank him for it, for fuck's sake. \n\nAnticipating the unpleasant taste, Wipler steeled himself and downed about a quarter of the bottle in one go. It wasn't any better than the last gulp, nor than the three beers that came before it, but at least he was slowly getting used to it. \n\n- But no, of course, let's just let him co-run this city. Him. A guy who never truly managed anything other than that subpar law firm. He just gets to show up and take all the credit. Oh, you great beacon of piety, tell me, is it all just some cynical game to you? Surely they see it. I can't be the only one who sees it. How he shifts his beliefs so much, even I can no longer tell what his real ones are. And still, I'm just left playing follower, doing his dirty work while he and Rydzyk run this place to the ground. And what do I get for it? Instead of any recognition, a free supply of... this. \n\nFinishing the bottle, he pushed it to the side just hard enough to barely avoid it breaking before quickly reaching for the next one. \n\n- I can't keep doing this anymore. That's it. I'm out. If Mentzen wants to continue this charade, he can do that without me. Either he gives me the credit and influence I deserve, or I'm making my way back to Piekary. I don't need this. I will no longer... \n\nWipler's plans were interrupted by the familiar ringtone. Against his better judgment, he diligently answered. \n\n- Przemek, look, I'll be running late from tonight's event. Could you swing by my office and finish the agenda I started for the party's next session? \n- Uh, yeah, of course. I'll make sure to get it done. \n- Great. I really owe you one. Let me know if there’s anything I could do for you in return. \n- Actually, Sławek, do you think it would be possible to..."

TOR.8.t: "Gluttony"
TOR.8.desc: "The three of them sat by the extendable dining table, filled on all four sides with dishes large and fancy enough to sustain a whole banquet. Many of the delicacies, made with admittedly impressive finesse, were items Mentzen hadn't seen since before the Fall, making him wonder just how exactly Rydzyk was able to acquire them in the middle of a national collapse. Whatever his musings may have been, the priest seemed to give them little attention as he continued to sample bite-sized chunks from one plate after another. They sat there in silence for nearly half an hour as the Father Director feasted, making Sławomir wonder about the sheer capacity of the old man's stomach. Still, there was one thing that occupied his mind to a far greater degree. \n\n- So, would you mind telling me why exactly I've been invited? It's been a while since the last time I was here. \n- Shh, no need to worry. It's a celebration, and I want you to be a part of it. You've been a great asset to us lately. Honestly, without your help, we couldn't have achieved half of what we've done. - Rydzyk spoke with his mouth full, taking bites between every couple of words. \n- Yeah, asset... about that. I was thinking it might be time to turn our alliance into an equal partnership. \n\nThe priest nearly spat out his food in laughter, looking at Mentzen as if what he had just said was nothing but a hilarious joke. \n- I'm being serious. We account for half of the city's forces. We deserve to have a permanent seat at the table. \n- Have some humility, boy. What could you possibly know about running a whole country? It's best for all of us if you stay in your lane. \n- What could I know? I ran a party many times larger than your circle of geriatric followers. Oh, and you wouldn't have Toruń if it weren't for my assistance. \n- What the Father Director intended to say is... - Król tried to insert himself into the argument to stop the rising tensions. \n- I know very well what I intended to say. Either our current arrangement stays, or you can pack your things and go elsewhere. \n- I don't know what you're expecting, but I'm not going to just leave my city after fighting so hard to take it back... \n- Good. Keep doing what you're doing, then. You can have your rallies and beer parties while we take care of running this place. \n\nContent with having had the last word and all of his demands met, Rydzyk went back to chewing on a prime piece of rib as they once again sat in complete silence."

TOR.9.t: "Sloth"
TOR.9.desc: "The early morning sun slowly climbed to its rightful place on the still half-dark sky, peering through the curtains of an outmoded, lavishly decorated room to the accompaniment of the birds' early, enthused chirps. Feeling the warm rays on his face, Tadeusz Rydzyk turned contentedly, not bothering to open his eyes once in the process as he enjoyed one of his favorite perks of a clerical lifestyle - being able to sleep in on a weekday. Half-awake, the priest barely registered the frantic knocks at his door, forcing his visitor to eventually walk in unannounced. \n\n- Father Director! I'm terribly sorry to disturb you. I've been asked to present you with today's itinerary. All pre-checked, of course. - The fresh-faced chaplain stumbled over his words, trying to avoid the ire of his superior. - I know you specifically requested not to be woken up under any circumstances, but Father Grakowicz has requested that your homily be moved up by an additional hour. \n- Grakowicz... always some issues with him. - Rydzyk muttered incoherently. - And why does this oaf need me so early? \n- Scheduling issues, Father Director. Simply no other time his parish could host you without disturbing their regular operations. \n- Out of the question. If he's unable to hold the homily during reasonable hours, he can deliver it himself if he's so eager. \n- Should I... tell him to reschedule? \n- No. Tell him it's off. I'm not visiting that place until he learns to respect my precious time. \n- Y... yes, Father Director. As you wish. In that case, today's first item is the radio sermon at twe... \n- Send Paweł. - Rydzyk waved his hand dismissively. \n- But... Father Pakuła already had to host the Lauds at six... \n- Good, he could use some hard work for once. Keep going. What's next? \n- W... well, there's also the service at three... \n- Can't you get someone else to do it? \n- What!? It'll be right here at the Sanctuary. Please, Father Rydzyk, we're already stretched thin as is. \n- Listen. - The annoyance at being woken up against his wishes was becoming increasingly clear in the priest's voice. - Once you've lived as long as I have, you'll know not to exert yourself unless it's absolutely necessary. Now, tell me, does that apply to my presence at this service? Will anything happen if I'm not there? \n- I suppose not... - The chaplain said in defeat. He knew there was nothing to gain by arguing. - In that case, that would be all for today. Once again, I apologize for troubling you, Father Director. \n\nOvercome with relief, Rydzyk adjusted his blanket and closed his eyes once more. Too preoccupied with this task to care whether his interlocutor had left the room, he mumbled a few words in response before drifting off to sleep with a single thought on his mind - today was going to be a good day."

TOR.10.t: "Wrath"
TOR.10.desc: "The irregular clink of glass bottles resonated around the arena, converted into a makeshift pub for its first major event since the country's breakup. While the more traditionally oriented folk were busy grumbling at the hedonistic nature of the occasion, Kuyavia's new generation looked for its own kind of guidance - a booze-fuelled rant by a down-on-his-luck politician. It took considerable time to produce enough brew for the masses half-expecting not to leave the building on their own two legs, especially with the still-questionable status of external supply, but through some shrewd logistics and major loosening of industry standards, none of the participants had to wait with their mouth dry, including the event's primary speaker and organizer. Addressing the mesmerized crowd, already softened up by a number of guest panelists, Sławomir Mentzen felt like a fish back in its familiar waters. Gazing at the waves of his unwavering support, he felt powerful. Far more powerful than whatever Rydzyk could count on from his geriatric followers. He was fired up, ready to challenge for the proverbial crown he was just recently denied. Now was the time to seize it all. \n\nHe stepped up to the stage, already swaying slightly, gripping the podium for support. \n\n- Thank you. All of you. For taking back this city. - He raised the glass he was holding for a toast. - But we're not here to reminisce. There'll be a time for that. Hopefully soon. But for now, I don't know about you, but something about this victory seems especially sour. While we put our lives at risk clearing every street, every apartment from the red pestilence, some guy in a black cassock comes in and steals all the thunder. We've done most of the job. Without us, he would've been holed up in his complex by now, hiding from this or that militant. So what are the thanks we get? \n\nThe anger in his eyes was palpable, breaking through the slur in his voice. This was far more than just drunk, emotional rambling. He had a score to settle, and the people could tell, booing and laughing at every mention of Toruń's ruling High Priest. \n\n- Nothing. And you know what I have to say to him? I say, let him do his worst! We don't need him! We never did! - Even as he was swaying with every overly pronounced gesture, Mentzen maintained the open challenge. - Not for another second will we kneel before him. It's about time we became the rulers of our own domain. You hear this, 'Father Director?' Our partnership? It's over! It's war! It's... \n\nBefore he could cause any more damage to himself, a team of aides rushed him off the stage. He fought back against them, unsuccessfully. In the back of the crowd, an unassuming minister, dressed in plain clothing, turned off his recording."

TOR.11.t: "Walk of Shame"
TOR.11.desc: "The fifteen-or-so-minute walk from St. Catherine's Square to St. John's Cathedral had never felt so excruciatingly long. Every step of the way, Sławomir Mentzen could feel hundreds of piercing eyes - sneering, mocking him with revulsion. He felt as if the whole city had specifically gone out of their way to cancel whatever plans they might have otherwise had to come and shame him, which likely wasn't far from the truth, given that Rydzyk made sure to spread the word at just about every recent sermon. It didn't take much effort to realize, especially since the priest couldn't stop visibly gloating with his colleagues, that the display had little to do with forgiveness. He was to be thoroughly humiliated, to serve as an example of what happens when someone flies close enough to the sun to dare challenge the word of the infallible theocrat. \n\nThe rough penitent's clothing pricked into his skin with every step, seemingly getting worse each time he adjusted it. If there was anything Mentzen was at least partly grateful for, it's that none of the lackeys responsible for planning the event got the idea to saddle his weak back with an actual cross to bear. Though, perhaps, they simply didn't want to run the risk of anyone feeling remotely sympathetic for him. Sluggishly, he marched to the nauseating sound of poorly tuned hymns, forced to stop at every station, hang his head down in disgrace, and face the victorious clergyman, proclaiming the phrase: \n\n- Father, I have sinned against God and the Church, by His grace ordained. For the crime of conspiring against His chosen servants, I beg your forgiveness. \n\nEach time saddling himself with another exaggerated or simply made-up offense, Mentzen could clearly see the crowd get increasingly agitated with every confession. The displeased murmurs that hounded him at the start of the journey soon morphed into a furious outcry of the worst expletives the mob could utter without simultaneously condemning themselves; though it didn't take long for that line to be crossed as well. Enraged, the people crashed against the barricades, ready to enact their own version of justice that Rydzyk, in his magnanimity, seemed too lenient to enforce. Feeling the growing danger, Mentzen tried to rush the remaining part of the ceremony, pushing hurriedly through the protective cordon until he felt a harsh thud just to the side of his foot - a loose piece of cobble aimed for his head that luckily for him, barely missed the mark. Yet the assault only served as further encouragement for the frenzied crowd, which, in a near instant, began pelting the sinner with whatever materials they had on hand. Ripping the paving stones off the streets, they blindly rained the Lord's wrath upon him, knocking out numerous members of the entourage as collateral damage until an intervention by the assembled peacekeepers finally managed to disperse the gathering."

TOR.12.t: "A Conflict of Intentions"
TOR.12.desc: "Krystian excitedly made his way through the damp corridors of the seminary's living quarters. Though his arm was starting to hurt from dragging his overstuffed suitcase, filled with most of his belongings, across the entire hallway, he refused to stop for even a moment before reaching his destination. 237, his new home. For the young devotee, it was the culmination of years of preparations, the long-awaited chance to follow the religious calling he had felt since his early childhood. He turned the key, almost snapping the half-rusted base in the lock. With a noticeable creak, the door opened to reveal a modest, antiquated interior, with three beds positioned side by side to leave just enough space for a dusty wardrobe and a shared desk. His roommates were already inside, sizing Krystian up as he tossed the bag onto the considerably stained sheets and began to unpack. \n\n- As punishment or for the money? \n- Huh? What do you... \n- Not speaking clearly enough for ya? Are you here cause you got caught with something, or are you just after the cash?\n\n Krystian was taken aback. Instead of replying, he froze, staring uncomfortably at the person sitting at the opposite end of the room. \n\n- What? Ya deaf or somethin'? \n- N... no, just... I'm here to serve the Lord. Is... this some kind of joke? Like a hazing? \n- Pff, they still get those? - The other figure laughed, ignoring the question. The two exchanged glances, seemingly amused at the newcomer's answer. Well, looks like you're in for one hell of a rude awakening. \n- This... is the seminary, right? \n- You're damn right it is. And I can tell you right now that you ain't surviving more than a week with that stuck-up attitude. \n- Stuck-up? No, I... Look, I don't have to explain myself to you. You're probably not even part of it anyway. \n- That's where you're wrong, pal. We run this place. Unofficially, at least. And all fresh blood answers to us. That's right, you're looking at future Head Priest material, or better. So yeah, we could make your life a whole lot more difficult if you don't learn some respect. \n\nKrystian considered the situation for a moment before yielding to avoid making enemies on his first day, no matter how delusional he considered them. \n\n- Alright, uhh... whatever you say... \n- Now tell me, do you drink? \n- Well... only the sacramental wine. - Krystian laughed uncomfortably. \n- Uh-huh. Do you smoke? \n- N... never. \n- Do you... - He sized the newcomer up briefly. - Yeah, I'm not even gonna ask that one... \n- I'm guessing I should also say no... \n- Then genuinely what the fuck are you doing here? \n- Serving... God... Like I was supposed to... \n- Yeah, yeah, you said that already. Just don't get too attached to that. Don't get in the way, and we won't have problems. You'll drop that pious bullshit after a while here. Got it? \n- S... sure... got it..."

TOR.13.t: "The Birth of a Rebel"
TOR.13.desc: "In a small commercial area, nestled out of view just off to the side of Grudziądzka, a key clicked familiarly in its lock for the first time in three long years. The lights turned on after a brief flicker, and the heater slowly started its task of bringing the room to an acceptable temperature. Compared to the bombed-out husks once belonging to the building's other tenants, the office space seemed relatively peaceful, as if spared from the damage of the months of outright anarchy. Looking around, Sławomir Mentzen was glad he set aside a portion of his funds to renovate it, just in case. He never thought he'd be returning here, much less to weather the storm, but with his usual addresses ransacked and under strict surveillance, it was the only place he could hide while still maintaining the slightest dose of dignity. \n\nIn one of the empty offices, left behind by some temporary associate whose name he had already long forgotten, Mentzen put down his suitcase and laid out the inflatable mattress he'd have to use for the night. After pumping it up just enough to not feel the hard tiles underneath, the former tax consultant sat down on the makeshift bed, nostalgically looking through a series of old documents belonging to his pre-Fall clients. In his present situation, their mundanity seemed comforting after the recent weeks of political disgrace. \n\nThe sudden ring of the doorbell startled Sławomir, bringing him out of his thoughts. His heart skipped a beat as he feared that somehow, the angry mob had even followed him here. If that were the case, he realized, there was pretty much nowhere he could run, unless he was desperate enough to consider exiting through the window, that is. He took a step toward the door, making sure he was quiet enough that his presence couldn't be heard, and took a good look through the peephole. To his reassurance, there seemed to be no mob outside, only a single woman, roughly in her mid-20s, her posture visibly concerned. For a second, he considered whether that, too, could be a trap, but against his better judgment, he decided to let her in. \n\n- Umm, you're... Mr. Mentzen, right? \n- That depends on who's asking. \n- My... my name's Lidia. Lidia Barska. I heard about your recent falling out with Father Rydzyk. I... I believe I have some compromising information that could help you take him on. \n- Mrs. Barska, I'm sorry, but I'm not currently interested in antagonizing him even further. Besides, I highly doubt this information is something I haven't heard about before. \n- Whatever you knew about him isn't even the half of it. I was there, at the complex. A lot. Far more often than I would've wanted to. Please... I need this. For everything he did. Just... hear me out... \n- Alright. But I need you to know - I can't guarantee anything."

TOR.14.t: "The Price of a Clean Soul"
TOR.14.desc: "As he waited for the upcoming mass in humble piety, Paweł couldn't help but feel as out of place as the modernistic façade of the church towering before him. Unlike the unassuming handful pouring into the temple, locked in carefree chatter, he held no hope of receiving any salvation. If some sort of justice truly existed in the afterlife, he knew he'd already condemned himself to the deepest pits of hell. Over his mercenary career, the grizzled soldier managed to accrue a list of atrocities so lengthy, he'd usually be hard-pressed to remember anything past the most recent contract. Perhaps it was the savagery of the conflict that engulfed the once-prospering city or simply the cumulative effect of guilt he could no longer suppress, but after years of unquestioningly following the orders of the highest bidder, some unknown self-reflective force stirred inside Paweł, creating an unending pit of penitence he desperately tried to fill. Yet, the mere desire for change could hardly outweigh the mass of past crimes. No matter how many times he kneeled in quiet submission and how frequently he passed the sign of peace with his still bloodied hands, he could hardly find a reason to justify anything but eternal punishment for his troubled soul. Father Rydzyk gladly offered a solution. \n\nUNIVERSAL ABSOLUTION - the heavily creased pamphlet read in a tone so confident and boisterous, Paweł nearly dismissed it out of hand as the product of some overly enthusiastic marketing guru. Were it not for the weight of the matter, he would've thrown the paper out without a second reading. The claims were more than bold enough to spike his learned sense of risk assessment, or rather, in this case, the sense of knowing when not to waste his oh-so-precious time, but he was beyond desperate. \n\nIt took nearly a quarter of Paweł's entire war chest to secure his admission - a fact he made sure to bring up every time he considered backing out. Though the unexplained delay tested his thin patience, the appearance of nearly the entire clerical elite at the altar did eventually bring some comfort. Stepping up to the rostrum, the event's spiritual host wasted no time on prayers or structure, immediately diving into an impassioned speech. \n\n- Brothers and Sisters, it warms my heart deeply that you graced us with your attendance. The past few months have been a challenge for all of us. I hear many of you asking yourselves the question: how am I now supposed to live with this? And truly, I tell you this: none of us here are saints. None of us can be fully free from sin. And that's not a bad thing. You know well that you have only done what was necessary. Not always through moral means, but for a noble goal. And that is what the godless don't understand. They only want to search for any faults, any reasons to say: look, he's not a good catholic. But the fact that you've come here today already shows your devotion to God. Your sins have been absolved. You proved you are deserving of divine mercy. \n\nTen minutes, not a single one more. As he started shuffling out of the building, Paweł, supposedly now a new man, felt conflicted. He expected a struggle, a monumental battle against his inner demons to claw back at least an inch of redemption, and it was really going to be that easy? Just a few simple words, and he's good to go? Was he really even any different than before? The voice of doubt inside him blared, almost loud enough to miss the final crux of the impromptu homily:"

TOR.15.desc: "- Father Biernacki, upon the review of the results of our investigation into your behavior and the numerous testimonies of your parishioners, we have found indisputable proof of eight counts of sodomy, four of which included the altar boys you took under your wing. You have committed unforgivable crimes against God and Man and threatened the integrity of our Church. What do you have to say in your defense? - The parson’s stern voice boomed across the room, equal parts bored and disappointed. \n\nHearing his sins read out in plain text, the condemned priest could feel himself crushed by the full weight of his moral failings. How could he have strayed so far from the teachings? How could he sink so low, betray the Lord for some uncontrolled cravings? He was once just a starry-eyed boy, ready to devote his life to faith. How did it come to this? Now, all he could feel was guilt. - Father, I will not deceive you with claims of innocence, nor will I plead for your forgiveness. I will accept any punishment you deem fit, no matter how harsh. \n\n- Rise. - The ecclesiastical jurist remained unfazed. - You're lucky this didn't get out any further. It took considerable... incentives to make sure they didn't talk. Resources we'd much rather have kept on hand. You've become a risk for us, Father Biernacki.  \n- I am truly sorry, Father. I have failed you, but above all, I have failed God. I know I'm not worthy of this cassock. - Tears welled up in his eyes. - I promise never to wear it again. \n- Oh, stop being such a mess. It happens. You slip up sometimes. What's the big deal all of a sudden? Look, let me tell you this: personally, I like them a bit older, you see. They know when not to tattle. But... I will have to make sure you don't get us in any more trouble. \n- I... I don't understand. But... it's wrong... aren't you going to expel me from the Church? - he sniffled with every word. \n- Now, why would I do that? - The parson laughed heartily. - If I did, there'd soon be nobody left to run this place.  \n- W... what about... \n- Listen, I discussed your case with Rydzyk. He cleared a spot for you under his direct oversight. Consider it... a disciplinary promotion. From now on, you tell him who you want to spend the night with, and he will find a way to get it arranged. Nothing happens without his direct approval, understood? \n- W... why are you... \n- Get over yourself. Grab your stuff and get ready to move. You start tomorrow. And one last thing, Father Biernacki..."

Single passersby, only one person of note - that drunk Wiesiek, probably off for another beer to cure, or prevent, his daily hangover. Will keep an eye on him. \n\n6:12 - Still quiet. The broken streetlights are obscuring my view. Unidentified movement. Probably kids. Or a large animal. Cannot tell. \n\n6:33 - Wiesiek is back with a whole carton. Laid it out on the bench and started downing it brutishly. A few more bums are approaching him with their own drinks. \n\n7:35 - People shuffling off to work. Kinga is wearing that skimpy dress again. Third warning: will report the issue to the parish authorities. They'll sort her out. At least Łucja seems to have learned her lesson. Though she does seem more apprehensive than usual. Suspicious. \n\n10:28 - There was an almost 10-minute delay in the radio program. Unacceptable. \n\n11:13 - Wiesiek and his bunch are getting rowdy. Started catcalling every passing woman aged 15-50. Repeated calls to the authorities to straighten them out have been rudely ignored. \n\n12:51 - And here comes Mariola, that spineless old hag. Seems to be back with groceries. Considerably less than last week, though. Ha, running out of cash maybe? Pension ain't enough? Good. She's got it coming. \n\n14:03 - The kids are beginning to return from school. Oh, they all look so precious. A shame they'll soon grow up into such delinquents. I've seen little Janek with that cigarette he got from God-knows-where. He really thinks I can't spot him behind those bushes. His alcoholic mother must be so proud... \n\n14:40 - The predictable has happened. Wiesiek has passed out on the bench in some unnatural, contorted position. Exactly 21 minutes earlier than yesterday. At least he won't be bothering anyone for the next few hours. \n\n16:31 - Some of the hooligans started gathering on the mound. Troublemakers. Dangerous bunch. Harassed Jadzia on her way back from church on Sunday. Previous report met with a blind dismissal that they're likely just 'good, pious boys, preventing degeneracy on the streets.' The nerve. I know just about every single person in this parish who actually attends Mass. They're definitely not among them. \n\n18:02 - Kaja is back with... is that yet another man? I swear she was with someone different a month ago. This cannot stand. Such debauchery warrants an immediate call to the vicar's office! \n\n19:46 - Time to head to bed. I can already see Gienia in the window. She'll take care of the night watch. Not like I could help much at this point anyway. She's got far better eyesight than I do.

Look, these are those crosses Mariola told me about. \n- Beautiful, oh, truly beautiful, Halinka. - The slightly younger of the two women replied in amazement. - You know, I actually helped fund those. They collected offerings for them at my parish last August. Really had to dig into my pockets for it. Didn't even give Janek any cash for his name day. But oh, was it worth it. \n- You've always been a lucky one. Like that trip to Jasna Góra you won in '97... \n\nPassing by the imposing structure of the Sanctuary, the pair laboriously made their way down a couple of steps and entered the park-like area to its direct Northwest. Awe-struck, they passed by the countless monoliths dotting its landscape, documenting the nation's fallen heroes, occasionally stopping to see if anyone from their childhood years had made the list. \n\n- Halinka, this whole place is breathtaking. Father Rydzyk has truly outdone himself. The folks back home will hardly believe it when I describe it to them. \n- You know, Grażyna... there's only one thing that concerns me. It's so empty. Nice evening, perfect weather, and nobody except us bothered to visit. \n\nThat's how it is these days, dearie. The kids have no God in their hearts. And their parents... don't even get me started. Complete moral downfall. You remember my nephew Paweł? He didn't even push for his son's confirmation. \n\nHearing unknown voices within the secure perimeter, an armed, out-of-breath guard ran up to the visitors, expecting a hostile incursion. Judging the two elders as harmless, the instinctive panic within him gave way to a wave of anger. \n\n- What the hell are you doing here? This is a restricted area! \n- Oh, just taking a little stroll. We haven't been to this place in years. It brings a tear to my eye just how much has changed. Do you work here, sir? Could you please send my regards to Father Rydzyk? \n- THERE WERE 3 GUARD POSTS ALONG THE WAY. HOW DID YOU... \n- Were there really? Well, we must've missed them. Not the same eyesight as back in the day. But when we were your age, you best believe me... \n- YOU CAN'T JUST... ugh... ma'am, listen, I need you to tell me EXACTLY what you saw here. \n- How nice of you to ask, dear. So, first, there was this gorgeous statue of our late pope. Truly lifelike, I must say. You see, I actually met him once over thirty years ago. Not really personally, but... \n- Okay, okay, I get it. Anything actually noteworthy? \n- Definitely this park. Whoever arranged the design has my sincerest congratulations. Kind of reminds me of... \n- Ma'am. - The guard interrupted her before she could begin another unrelated tangent. - Did you spot anything... problematic? \n- Hmm, no, nothing comes to mind. Should I have? \n- Uhhh... no need to worry about it. - He wiped his forehead in relief. - But I will need you to go back now. Come. I'll escort you out. We can grab some postcards on the way."

TOR.18.t: "Donation Control"
TOR.18.desc: "Marcin Sekulski was far from a pious man. When asked about anything remotely political in private, he loved to resort to a simple maxim - 'There are two groups of thieves in this country: the government and the Church.' Before Rydzyk's takeover, the last time Marcin entered a temple was his begrudging attendance at his own daughter's baptism, about which he made sure to complain to anyone who listened. Yet, despite his disdain for organized religion, he recognized it was far better for the safety of his family to act like good Christians for an hour each week than to abandon everything and start life elsewhere, especially considering their shoestring budget. \n\nThough the first few masses consisted mostly of improvisationally following along with whatever the crowd was doing, desperately trying not to give himself away, Marcin quickly got into a rhythm. Always coming in just early enough to grab seats near the middle of the nave, he made sure to perfectly blend in with the broader flock: neither too apathetic nor too eager. Whenever his most dreaded moment of the collection plate being passed came, he glanced at those just before him and copied the exact amount, no matter how unreasonably high it had to be. Ever since his parish installed electronic terminals instead, he had the displeasure of having to guess the perfect amount all on his own. \n\nWhen Marcin stepped up to the machine, just like always, he was greeted by a simple blue screen with nothing but a few buttons displaying different values. Normally, he'd play it safe and go for the fifty, perhaps forty on a bad day, but this time, he could really use some spare cash, and spending half his daily earnings on a donation to his most hated institution was simply too much of an emotional load to bear. \n\nFeeling the rebellious spirit, he bravely pressed the button displaying 25zł and tapped his card instinctively, almost in disgust. Instead of the typical ding, the terminal displayed the message: 'We have encountered problems confirming your payment. Please try again.' \n\nLooking back at the main display, Marcin saw that most of the options on the screen were now gone, with only two remaining: 25zł and 50zł, along with the text: 'Please confirm the amount you wish to donate.' As he once again tapped the same number as before, rather than direct him to the payment, the terminal froze, and a loud alarm blared for the entire church to hear. \n\nFrantically looking around for the source of the ear-splitting noise, Marcin jumped in shock as an arm was placed on his shoulder and two burly men in altar boys' clothing surrounded him. \n\n- Mr. Sekulski, you've chosen to donate 50% less than usual, even though your account balance is pretty much the same. Come with us. We'll make sure to get to the bottom of this... problem."

TOR.19.t: "One Man's Trash..."
TOR.19.desc: "Marian was only one of the dozen or so folks inhabiting the abandoned mill in Winnica. He'd long since given up counting just how many of them he shared the space with. Can't get too attached once the sight of people succumbing to the conditions mere meters from the old mattress and rugs he calls a bed, becomes a regular occurrence. Sometimes, as the cold enveloped him, he could swear he saw them all again. Their faces, free from the signs of constant struggle, called for Marian to give in, but through some unconscious instinct, he simply never could. Not yet. \n\nDuring his usual daily activity of scouring the nearby trash for any usable scrap, Marian came across a neatly packaged, unopened stack of papers stuffed carelessly in the middle of the garbage pile. Either out of curiosity or the desire to check if the packet contained anything of value, he tore the envelope in half and stared blankly at the wording inside - after all, it was clear someone tried hard not to have these delivered. \n\nAt first, the tramp grumbled in irritation upon seeing that the packet contained nothing besides a set of identical copies of an aid application form, but after nearly throwing it away, he was able to put two and two together, realized that he might actually stand to benefit from the program, and hauled the documents back to the mill for everyone to fill out. \n\nOf all the requests sent out by the handful still strong enough to input all the necessary details, Marian's was the sole one not rejected either over some bureaucratic technicality or sent back with a dismissive: 'Not found to be in need of assistance.' Following a few days of silence, a reluctant official arrived to survey the recipient's living conditions; a fact that locked the entire collective into a shouting match over which critically needed resource, out of the multitude they lacked, they wished to pick as their desired subsidy. Seeing the starved faces of his comrades, Marian chose the one thing they could help stave off the worst - food. \n\nThe next day, Marian awoke to the sound of a truck slowly backing up toward the mill's entrance. He quickly got up and rushed to be the first to bring the good news and distribute the reward. Just past the entrance, he was hit with a smell of decay so strong, it caused him to pause right in his tracks. As the vehicle unloaded its cargo, dumping the entirety onto one massive pile before promptly speeding off, the beggar was left with a mass of half-eaten remnants - all that was left from one of the numerous feasts recently hosted at the Sanctuary. Nearly retching in disgust, he began to sift through the contents. At least some of them had to be edible enough, and he swore not to return empty-handed. Not while the others needed his help so desperately."

TOR.20.desc: "- Alright, boys. Here's the list. A thousand per head, minimum. And you better bring it back untouched. I'll make sure you get your cut. Now, get to it. \n\nWithout a word, the goons dispersed across the few nearby flats as their kingpin stayed behind in his black sedan. Contentedly watching his underlings hard at work, Father Starzyński opened up a fresh pack of cigarettes, lit up the first one, and enjoyed the well-deserved moment of peace. It was his favorite part of the job. Rather than slaving away all day, carefully maintaining the image of a diligent, pious cleric, he could simply sit back and watch the money pouring in, all without requiring his slightest input. It should be a while before... \n\nA knock on the window. The overgrown figure in front of him seems heavily confused; not that it seems particularly difficult to confuse him. \n\n- Ey boss... uhh... Father. This 'un ain't cooperatin'. Whatcha wan' me to do with 'im? \n- Tell me, Michał. Why do I always have to handle these matters myself? Would it really hurt you to take care of it yourself for once? \n- Well... you did tell me not to hit 'em unless you say so... \n- Ugh, alright, you brute. Watch and learn... again. Try to actually comprehend something this time. \n\nStraightening out his cassock, the priest followed his grunt to the apartment in question. After a polite ring of the doorbell, a startled, middle-aged man greeted the sudden visitor. \n\n- Oh, Father Starzyński, I... didn't expect you here in person. Is there... something wrong? \n\nThe guest bowed politely, as befitting his position. He spoke soothingly, at least at first. \n- Forty-six thousand, Mr. Kotarski. Does that number sound familiar? \n- Umm... I don't think I... \n- It's your family's combined income for the past month. You seem quite well off; my sincerest congratulations to you. So tell me, Mr. Kotarski, what the fuck is this supposed to mean? \n\nThe priest pulled out the hastily ripped envelope filled with a single hundred złoty bill and nearly pushed it in the poor man's face. \n- It seems to me that you clearly don't value our protection. Spiritual, and... material. We live in dangerous times, don't we? It would be a shame if something were to happen to this lovely home of yours. \n- W-what? But I... we always paid this much. We've always been generous to the Church... \n- Times have changed. Prices have gone up. And I can tell you right now that if this is all the money you can cough up, let's just say we can no longer guarantee your safety... \n- Oi boss! Can we finally whack 'im? - One of the muscled-up altar boys blurted out, bored with the not-so-subtle intimidation. \n- Shhh, Michał. Not yet. - The clergyman turned back to the homeowner. - Ain't he a sweet one? So, what will it be? Would you like to give a satisfactory offering after all? \n\nTerrified, not so much of the priest as of the brutes standing behind him, the host reached for a small box and hurriedly pulled out a small stack of bills, presenting them as tribute. \n\n- You seem to have more stored away in there, Mr. Kotarski. Don't think we wouldn't notice. \n- But... this is already more than is required. Please, that is my entire crisis fund. I can't... \n- Next time, make sure to hand over the required amount at the first time of asking. Your choice. You know the alternative."

The lack of any heavy weaponry during the conflict is perhaps the only reason why the inelegant, concrete apartment blocks of the Soviet era managed to survive, albeit riddled with countless bullet holes and largely emptied out. The area was never considered high-class, but it was livable, despite its somewhat notorious reputation. Nowadays, it was the home of the runts of society - those unfortunate or crazy enough not to immediately leave for greener pastures. One thing was known - nobody came here without a clear purpose, and nobody stayed longer than they absolutely needed to. \n\nTadeusz Rydzyk steeled himself for the upcoming task. It sounded simple: pass through the area with a considerable escort, give out a few blessings, tell the good word to the struggling population... all basic PR work, like the good old days. He took another sip of the fine whisky, sighed, then downed the rest of the glass in one strong swig. In moments like this, he preferred to have his senses at least partially numbed. \n\nStepping out onto this godforsaken land, Rydzyk carefully considered his surroundings. He felt uneasy, far from the usual order of his carefully maintained environs. It didn't take long before he began to attract attention, something he desperately hoped to avoid. At first, it was confused glances, as if unsure if the priest was merely an illusion. Then, ragged, disheveled figures began to slowly gather along his path. Were they friendly? Hostile? He knew one thing - he'd much rather keep his distance. Eventually, one of the stragglers, a man in his late thirties, so unkempt he'd easily pass for double his real age, broke through the cordon and ran up to the esteemed visitor. \n\n- Father Director! Father Director! I... it's really you! Our prayers have been answered; praise the Lord! \n\nInstinctively, the priest recoiled, pulling back half a step to avoid any contact with the obtrusive pauper, who, by now, was on his knees, in disbelief that such a holy figure would grace his presence. \n\n- Yes, umm... please accept this blessing. May your faith not waver, and you shall be rewarded. - He performed a half-hearted sign of the cross, carefully keeping his distance from the devotee. - Now, please step aside. \n\nHowever minor, this perceived dispensing of divine favor only served to rile up the substantial crowd that gathered around Rydzyk, each of the inhabitants desperate for some sort of positive impulse in their lives, no matter how minor. With near-immediate speed, they began closing the distance, overpowering any attempts of the security detail to maintain control. \n\n- Father Director! If I could humbly ask... \n- For my family! Please, one for the family! \n- Please bless us, Father Rydzyk. We only need... \n\nThough the cleric worked with the speed of an assembly line on overdrive to hand out an unending amount of meaningless blessings, the frenzied tide of the faithful could not be stemmed.

And you, go in peace. And... no... stop... get... get off me for God's sake!"

TOR.23.desc: "Father Grakowicz has always been one to stay on the sidelines. While others busied themselves with the political struggle, the member of the moderate wing of the Redemptorist congregation focused his life's work on the spiritual side of the Church's mission. During his lengthy clerical tenure, he had served in many posts throughout the country, though all of them failed to get him any attention beyond his congregations. \n\nUnsurprisingly, this lack of notoriety made Grakowicz the perfect fit to oversee the city's second-largest redemptorist parish. Even though his position would normally call for him to at least attempt to rival Rydzyk, the priest made little effort to proclaim any stances, no matter how problematic the Father Director's actions became. At times, he chastised himself for not speaking up; for not steering the Faith in the way it had been righteously intended. In his eyes, the hypocrisy his now-superior represented could only lead to an even further deterioration of the Church's respect in the eyes of the people. To now be openly forced to praise him felt like a bitter pill, and for the first time in his thirty years of service, Father Grakowicz considered making his opposition heard. \n\nAs he stood at the altar, the priest observed the temple's interior, looking carefully from right to left. The size of the audience surprised him. Not once in the last five, perhaps even ten years... no, maybe even since his late childhood, had he seen a nave so packed to the brim with worshipers. All their eyes were glued to him reverently, with not a single disinterested expression in sight. The only ones not focusing intently on his words stood in a long queue for the confessional, repeatedly muttering the proper sequence of words to not irritate the confessor inside. A joyful tear swelled in his eye right as he was about to speak. \n\n- My dear Brothers and Sisters, I have many disagreements with Father Rydzyk. Before I began, I wrote a little note not to forget any of them. I ran out of space, so I had to get another. I will not stand before you today and tell you that he represents the epitome of Christian values. I'd have to answer before God for breaking the eighth commandment if I did. But seeing you all gathered here today, I can say one thing: Tadeusz Rydzyk is the best thing that has happened to Polish society in this entire century. Whatever his faults may be, he is the only person capable of restoring this country to its religious roots. And you can all silently judge him, and you can be assured that I will do so as well, but I implore each and every one of you to look beyond the Father Director's personal moral failings and appreciate all the good he has done, and continues to do, for the world. Forget not that only God is free from sin. Brothers and Sisters, in honor of Father Rydzyk, join me in prayer: Ave Maria..."

He will always be remembered as a martyr for our cause. Any questions, class? \n- Why would they do that? That's not nice. - A girl, no older than 10, asked innocently. \n- Because they were communists. And communists don't like God. Father Popiełuszko was telling everyone the truth about our Lord, and that scared them. When they are scared, those without Him in their hearts do bad stuff. - The teacher, roughly in her mid-20s, answered eagerly without much thought. \n- How can you not like God? Everyone likes God. - Another pupil chimed in. \n- Well... it's hard for me to believe either, but some people, faced with the truth of the Bible, see the Lord as anything other than the source of all good. \n- Like with the Flood? \n- What about the Flood, Ania? \n- I mean... didn't all the people who couldn't get on the Ark die? \n- Yes, but they were sinners. Noah was righteous, and God saved him from the water. \n- Should sinners die? My dad's a sinner. I don't want him to die. - A boy spoke out, worried. \n- Look, I'll ask Father Opałka to come and explain the story to you again on Monday. Can we get back to the lesson, please? \n\nThe dilapidated classroom, with crosses, ornaments, and pictures of prominent clergymen hung right above the whiteboard, was full of all sorts of ruckus.

She was guessing. \n- But you always told us to share. Are you a communist, Miss Kasia? \n- No, that's... it's different, alright? For example, communists don't like to pray. You can tell someone is a communist when they act up and disobey what they're told. \n- Miss, one time, you didn't do what Father Opałka asked. Does that mean... \n- No! Enough. You're getting detention. I can't be bothered with you today. \n\nIn the back of the class, another kid raised his hand shyly. \n\n- Miss Kasia, is Jaś a communist?"

Our commanders are still figuring out the supply lines, and there must have been a mix-up with the delivery because by the time they got to me, I had to throw half the items away, but the ones I was able to reheat were still a dozen times better than the rations they usually give us. At least I'm lucky to be on good terms with the cook; otherwise, I would've had to eat everything that you've made cold. \n\nThe front's still a mess. Not much has changed on that part since I last wrote. We still get the occasional cheers as we pass by, but the further we get from Toruń, the more hostile the locals tend to become. You wouldn't believe some of the insults they throw at us. You'd think that the light of our Lord reaches everywhere, but it seems that outside the range of our station, the darkness has made its way into the people's hearts. Knowing that we're fighting to bring them salvation makes it easier to endure the hardships, but sometimes, it gets hard to keep marching, knowing there's only going to be more peril ahead. \n\nGrandma, I miss home. I miss you, my parents, and even Wojtek a little bit. After being separated from everyone for so long, you learn to appreciate all the little things you always take for granted. I know how important our mission is, but I just wish to be back in my room; to have a normal life again. I'm guessing that you'll probably end up showing this letter to the rest of the family, and I can already see how funny those words will seem to them since I was the one who ran away, but if there's anything I'd want you to relay to them, it's that I apologize. I don't know if by the time this war is done, I'll even have a home to return to. I don't expect anyone to forgive me, but I'd give everything up to start again. \n\nAs much as I'd like to describe everything my unit and I have been through, I'm afraid this is all I can write for now. We're being called for another offensive. I'm to be part of the spearhead. Please, if you can, pray for me and my safety. And thank you. I don't know how long I would've lasted without your help.

On the opposite side of an all-purpose table, her husband, Mirosław, had just started dealing the cards for another round of solitaire. In the corner of the room, a portable radio played a recording of last Sunday's homily. The sound continued unnoticed in the background as the couple focused on their activities. \n\n- Your illegitimate country has turned away from God. \n\nThe words didn't catch much attention besides a small furrow of the brow from Mirosław. Krystyna got up to make herself some tea. \n\n- By fighting against all that is righteous, your country has doomed you and blocked your path to salvation. \n\nConcerned, Mirosław stopped dealing the cards. He called his wife over to come back immediately and hear what the priest was saying. She had just put the kettle on. \n\n- For is it not a sin to see injustice and refuse to call it out? To reap the rewards of service to someone who defies the Lord? When we refuse to speak, we give our quiet support for their blasphemous actions. We make ourselves guilty by association. \n\nBy now, the two were listening in intently, transfixed on the fiery, judgmental words coming out of the radio. They feared for their souls; they feared their inaction had paved their way to eternal suffering in the depths of hell. \n\n- And even if we confess, even if we maintain our own personal piety, we do little to save ourselves, for what good is repentance if you continue to live in sin? Only by breaking out of this spiritual prison do we guarantee ourselves a chance at redemption in the eyes of the Lord. \n\nConcern was slowly giving way to determination. They couldn't let the actions of their government stand between them and God. Whatever was necessary, they knew they had to do it, no matter how demanding. \n\n- Brothers and sisters, you need to rise up against this injustice. You must do all in your power to oppose, hinder, and strike against those who oppress the faithful. Know that the Lord always watches. You cannot hide from his judgment. Take up arms against those godless tyrants. Spread this message to anyone who can also be saved. And if you fall, dear listeners, your sacrifice will undoubtedly ensure your place in His kingdom. \n\nThe homily ended, and the broadcast cut to a soft tune. \n\n- Krystyna, get me my gun.

Every couple of seconds, he turned in discomfort, eliciting an irritating series of creaks from the old sofa bed made available by his hosts. Annoyed, he stared blankly at the half-a-century-out-of-style wall unit covering a substantial portion of the room, decorated with unused silverware and photos of people who've likely since aged a generation. The gentle chirp of the birds outside harmonized with the low hum of the portable radio stationed in the kitchen - a sign that one of the owners was already up. Between the intense training regimen demanded by his unit and the near-constant availability he had to maintain, the mercenary expected to spend all his available alone time soundly passed out, but the troubles of acclimatization continued to weigh on him. \n\nMiłosz heard two knocks before the handle turned, and a woman roughly in her mid-sixties entered the room, carrying a simple homemade breakfast. He quickly checked the time - it was 6:02. \n\n- Wake up, sleepyhead. It's daytime already. \n- Huh? - He answered in a half-asleep tone. - Get off my back; I'm way too tired for this. \n\nThe elder lady ignored her guest's complaints, put the plate on a small coffee table next to the bed, and, with a surprisingly swift move, opened the blinds, filling the room with light. \n\n- Seriously, what's wrong with you, woman? - The mercenary hissed, covering his eyes to shield them from the sudden brightness. \n- Cmon, get up. We'll be late for church. Father Milejczuk's celebration of the Roraty is not something you want to miss. \n- Church? I have to be up in an hour to check in for my morning drills. You honestly think I'd rather spend this time on some non-obligatory mass? I need to get some actual sleep, for fuck's sake. \n- Oh, that. I spoke with your captain yesterday. He agreed to give you the day off if you spent the day with me. \n- Wait... you really did that? For me? But why? - A genuine tear of happiness welled up in the corner of Miłosz's eye. He was far from being used to nice gestures. \n- Of course. All that war and fighting you do... sometimes, it's easy to forget who it's all for. Besides, I don't believe you've gotten a proper welcome. I can show you around the city. \n- I don't know what to say... \n- You can thank me later, young man. Right now, I need you at the door in no more than thirty minutes. Here's breakfast. Just don't take too long.

It brought him no enjoyment, maybe besides the fact that he felt tough when he winced from the taste. He contemplated immediately ordering another, but he was getting dangerously close to remembering. The past, the faces... the pain... A firm grip on his shoulder interrupted the incoming descent. \n\n- Well, I'll be damned. Karol fuckin' Michalczak, live in the flesh. I thought you died back in Ukraine, ya bastard. \n- Wish I did, man. Wish I did. But damn does that brings me back. Those were the times. \n- We sure gave those Russians hell. The Ukrainians couldn't have done it without us. \n- Mhm, and then as soon as that's done, they turn around and invade us. Fuckin' khokhols... \n- Ungrateful as always. But I'm not here to whine. That's their problem, not mine. - He paused, changing the topic. - So what’s a cruel ol’ bastard like you doing in a place like this? You don’t strike me as a penitent.  \n- Neither do you. For two years we’ve fought together, I ain’t seen you pray once. \n- Mariupol. I prayed in Mariupol. \n- Yeah, you thought you were going to die, you idiot. That don’t count. It’s something you’re supposed to do on your own. \n- Well, well. Look who's had a religious awakening in his old age... \n- Put some respect on the name, eh? I ain't here on some glorified mission trip. I doubt you're here for that reason either. \n- Me? Nah, no way I'd reduce myself to a groveling paragon of virtue. It's far too late for that, anyway. But if I can keep doing what I've always done and get back some favor with the big guy upstairs in the process, you know damn well I'm down for a contract. \n- Cmon, you really believe all that 'absolution' crap? You've been killin', lootin', and whorin' all your life, and you expect it all to be forgiven just because one priest says so? \n- Karol, if you thought it's all bullshit, you wouldn't have come here all the way from Silesia. Of course, it's unlikely to change a thing. I ain't stupid. But I think you and I both know it's our only chance. \n- It really is this or nothing, huh? Get me another drink, man.

He felt as though he was losing a considerable portion of his honor in the process, but the offer was simply too good to pass up, far better than the option of facing a military tribunal. The battalion's headquarters, though familiar, felt unusually claustrophobic now that he wasn't the one in charge. Though he knew that things would soon return to normal, he still experienced a profound humiliation - the unerasable blemish of defeat. The signature would only make it official. \n\nBefore the Colonel even got the chance to make contact with the document, the door swung open with force as his commanding officer burst into the room. \n- Is anybody going to tell me what the hell this is supposed to be? - Adamczak waved a small slip of paper furiously. \n- This? That's just a simple pledge of allegiance to Father Rydzyk. Nothing out of the ordinary. All our enlisted soldiers have to sign it. - The chaplain answered, unbothered. \n- We had an agreement. You let me and my men off the hook as long as we agree to serve in your army. This was not part of that agreement! \n- Circumstances change. At present, we cannot offer you any special treatment, no matter what your rank is. \n- I am a General of the Polish Army! I will not bow before some theocrat with delusions of grandeur! \n- A General who has failed to defend himself from three separate invasions... \n- Unlike you, and apparently unlike Colonel Dyk, I still have some sense of honor. I have over forty years of tactical, command, and logistical experience. You will treat me as befits someone of my stature! \n- No matter how much of a fuss you make, General, you cannot change reality. Where was all that experience when you lost to a bunch of untrained peasants and a handful of uncoordinated mercenaries? If you had done a better job, you wouldn't have found yourself in this position. This is the best offer you're going to get. Take it or get out. \n- Ha, good luck. - Adamczak snarked. - You wouldn't have lasted a week in my position. I can tell by the way you utilize your units that you're a complete amateur without any formal training. You'll find out how difficult this role is soon enough. Rest assured that I'll be watching your pitiful performance with a good deal of satisfaction. \n\nJust as abruptly as he entered, the General left the room, tearing up the pledge and leaving it behind him as he stormed out."

His co-conspirator was already expecting him. \n\n- Well, well. Look who it is. I thought I'd never see you again. How long has it been? - Mentzen spoke with a slightly relieved tone \n- About... three years now, I think. The times haven't been kind since we split up. \n- Yeah, I can tell. You look like crap. It's been that bad, huh? \n- Are you surprised? I'm lucky to even be alive. After Rydzyk's invasion, I was forced to relocate with what remained of my boys. You know how hard it is to get even basic supplies in these forests? \n- Mhm, so how do you get by? - He asked, with a hint of curiosity and slight amusement. \n- We raid, we loot, we take what we need, and then we relocate. It's almost surprising how little security they're setting up. The East is still mostly uncontrolled. All they did was rout us and then immediately move on. \n- For now. You know just as well that this isn't going to last. Once the wars end, the crackdowns will start... \n- And that's exactly why I'm here. You've got quite a nice setup, Sławek. I was thinking the two of us could maybe help each other out. \n- So... what exactly is it that you're expecting? \n- Well, you despise Rydzyk; I despise Rydzyk. You have the funds, I have... well, I used to have a paramilitary. But with a few generous donations, I could put it back together. If we get the timing right, we could make some sort of play and take the bastard down. - His eyes lit up in determination. \n- Look, I'm sorry, but there's not much I can currently do to assist you. I'm barely managing as it is. They're watching every move I make. I can't even leave this building with a dozen eyes following me. \n- So what, you're just going to surrender without a fight? Is this how you're planning to spend the rest of your life? \n- Just because I'm not rushing to get myself killed doesn't mean I'm not making my own plans. \n- Tell that to my men who are hiding in the woods, living off plundered scraps! \n- I'll take good care of them.

If you needed anything, you had to drive out to town to get it. If something broke down, your best bet was to fix it yourself because who knows how long it would take for the local administration to bother sending anyone to fix it. Even the priest who showed up for Sunday mass made sure to leave as soon as he was done with the service. Kazimierz Biernat was going to be the first resident Pastor the village hosted in... well, even the elders failed to remember when, or if, any of them bothered to stay here longer than a couple of hours. On an uncharacteristically warm day, almost a third of the population of just over five hundred came out of their homes to greet their new spiritual guardian. At 2:15 pm., a quarter late for the mass's planned start, the priest drove up in his black Mercedes. \n- Seriously? This is where they send me after six years of seminary? - Father Biernat grumbled to himself as he exited the car. \n\nAn unremarkable man approached the priest hurriedly, bowing before him politely. \n\n- Welcome, Father. We are honored by your presence and grateful that you decided to call this place your home. It's probably quite a different setting than the one you are used to, but we'll do all that we can to make sure you feel welcome. As the Wójt of this county, I'll personally... \n- Uh-huh. So I'm guessing this pile of rocks is your church, right? \n- Well, it's... certainly not some impressive basilica... - He laughed nervously. - But it does have its charm. \n- Listen, I have some standards. I'm not going to degrade myself to carrying out my ministry in this dump. \n- We're... terribly sorry, Father. Is there anything we can do to convince you? \n- I guess you can start by renovating and expanding the church to a respectable level. \n- I... doubt we have the money for such a project. \n- That's not my problem, is it? I'm not holding a single mass here until that's done. Call me when you think you're ready to host me somewhere that's less pathetic than this. \n- That might take some time, I'm afraid. - The wójt said, grinding his teeth in irritation. \n- Great. Oh, and one last thing. My stipend just got doubled. Seems fair for even considering taking this position, so don't disappoint me. \n\nWithout waiting for the official's protests, the priest got back in his car and left the village just as quickly as he arrived."

Even though he hadn't been here in a while, there was no way for the place not to feel comforting after calling it his home for nearly half of his already lengthy life. In some cruel display of intolerance, to silence the truth, both Bruski's liberal administration and the supposedly legitimate Chruch authorities tried to muffle him, preventing the priest from preaching even in his own parish. The Father Director could not let such an unfair punishment stand. \n\nA picture of Dmowski still hung on the eastern wall. It was the only object that hadn't been moved during his absence. They knew he would return. Some feared it; some awaited it. Now, he would pass judgment on the wicked. \n\n- Any news on their whereabouts? - Kneblewski felt immense satisfaction as he imagined finally capturing the missing officials of the city's former administration. \n- Umm, whose whereabouts, exactly, Father? - An altar boy asked in a frightful voice. \n- What do you mean 'whose'? Bruski, Krupa, the whole damn lot. \n- N... no signs so far. \n- I gave you one task, Kacper. One task. Is that really too much to ask? \n- I... I don't know. My parents made me sign up here. - The boy ran out of the room, sobbing. \n\n- Ugh, useless. Tell me that at least you have some good news, Wiktor. \n- Yes, Father! I closed down the bars, shut down the brothels, and burned all satanic books I could find, just as you asked! - He reported with uncontained excitement. \n- Hold on. You did that? You did all of that by yourself? \n- I brought a couple of my friends along. We really showed them! They were all completely scared when we came. Ha, they better be! That's what happens when you don't respect the Lord's commandments! \n- I don't even know what to say beyond the fact that I'm impressed. Go get yourself some communion wine as a reward. \n- But Father, I'm not allowed to... \n- Shh, you've earned it. Knock yourself out, kid. \n\nSatisfied, Kneblewski turned back towards the desk. Perhaps there was still hope for his little fiefdom.

There were no opportunities in Toruń, not for someone like her, at least. Back in Włocławek, she could've been anything. The sisterhood provided its members with near-complete freedom. Monika chose to be an artist. Her work was never unique enough to turn heads, but someone always threw in the occasional dime. Coupled with the subsidy that the state provided for creative fields, it was sufficient to maintain a decent standard of living. The times were good, and the work was tolerable. Above everything, after all the disappointments and restrictions the Polish government enforced throughout her life, she finally felt free. Now, it had all been taken away. \n\nIn Toruń, realistically, there were only two possible outcomes Monika could expect. All the 'traditional values' and 'homemaking' classes told her as much. Most likely, she was to be married off to some desperate, abusive boy. There were plenty of those in the city, and most already expected a reward for their service. On the other hand... Rydzyk took care of his own. She kept hearing those words as if it was meant to be some positive advertisement. The thought of what that really entailed made her stomach churn. She knew she had to create a third option for herself, somehow. \n\nOn the way back, Monika had a vision. During the morning prayer, Mary, Mother of God, had revealed herself to the thus far impious girl. She brought blessings upon the land and bore good providence for the Church that served her name. The revelation shook Monika deeply as she fell to her knees and confessed all her sins. At least that was the story she sold her captors. The genuine fear of what awaited her in the city helped her play the part. \n\nAt her request, Monika was rushed to the convent to dedicate herself to a monastic life. She realized she'd have to spend every single day of the rest of her life pretending, but still, it seemed far better than the alternatives. The harsh, unwelcoming exterior of the building made her temporarily reconsider, but before she could act, the Mother Superior had already come out to welcome her, dismissing the guards. \n\n- There was no revelation, was there? - The nun asked in an authoritative tone. \n- H... huh? No, I'm being honest. Mary revealed herself and... \n- Oh, don't give me that made-up story. I've heard it a hundred times before. I can tell when someone's faking it. \n- Please, just don't send me back... \n- You think anybody here cares what Rydzyk wants? Half of us used to be part of the resistance. You're safe here.

He did not complain. Always eager to help, he was one of the few seminarists in his class whose devotion actually seemed genuine. \n\n- Czarek, do you recognize any of the people in this room? - Jan Król pointed to three clergymen standing in the corner with a defiant expression, most of them twice, if not thrice, the deacon's age. \n- Of course. Well, two of them. The one on the left is Bishop Okroj. The one in the middle... that's Bishop Orchowicz. I can't quite recall the last one, but I know I've seen him at some point as well. \n- Huh, almost three for three. You missed bishop Wętkowski. But that's beside the point. I didn't bring you here just to play a guessing game. \n- I'm happy to serve our esteemed guests in any capacity you deem necessary, Father Król. - The deacon nearly bowed, instinctively. \n- No, no. If anything, they're going to serve you now. \n- Pardon? How so? \n- Are you a member of the Redemptorist congregation, Czarek? \n- Well, yes, but what does that have to do with... \n- Great. Almost thought you forgot there for a second. By decree, you outrank all clergymen not associated with the congregation. And since you’re only at the beginning of your journey, to be outranked by you means... well, essentially, it means being back at square one. \n- So you’ve just demoted some of the most prominent members of the Polish clergy? I trust your judgment, Father, but I can’t see how that’s warranted. \n- It’s not without reason. As you already know, we have a particular way of doing things around here. Those who were astray for most of their lives might have a difficult time adjusting to some of our more... unique practices. \n- So... want me as a temporary aide to help speed up the process? - The deacon cluelessly replied. \n- No, Czarek. Screw the old hierarchy. These people are below you now. Their ranks mean nothing. I've assigned them as your apprentices. I expect you to break them in. \n- And how exactly should I... \n- Remember all that hazing you had to go through in your first years in the seminary? Just do a bunch of that. Get creative.

Not in private, at least. At times, the Father Director would surprise the seminarists with an unexpected visit, usually coupled with some standard lecture about piety, modesty, and the like. Even these brief appearances were enough for the freshly ordained clergyman to start admiring his spiritual superior. Now that he'd joined the ranks of the congregation, he'd been bestowed the highest honor - he was summoned for an audience with Rydzyk. \n\nThe waiting room before the entrance to the study stunned Artur with its opulence. Two rows of marble statues covered either side of the rectangular corridor, each increasing in size and detail as one got closer to the door. Above its frame, hung a massive painting, stylized to resemble stained glass, of the Father Director towering over the world in a saintly form. From there, if one were to turn around, they'd see the splendor progressively diminishing with each step away from Rydzyk's quarters. Away from his light. A weak, raspy, but weirdly soothing voice called him in. \n\nStanding in the presence of his highest authority, Artur immediately got on his knees and bowed before the Father Director. The priest gestured for him to stand, smirking at the voluntary display of submission. \n\n- Congratulations, my child. You’ve completed a journey not many even dare embark on. As a reward, you may now freely choose your blessing. \n- A blessing, Father? - He asked, unsure. \n- Anything you'd like. You're one of us now. It's only appropriate that you receive a fitting present for your introduction. \n- If I may; if it's not too much of an ask, your benediction would be all I could ever need. \n\nRydzyk raised his eyebrow in surprise, as if the disciple had just said something concerning. \n\n- Seriously? You can have anything you'd like: a nice big cheque, luxury cars, your own little community out in the province to worship you... and you chose to instead hear a few encouraging words? That's it? \n-As was said in the book of Matthew: 'It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.' I wish not to go against His word. \n- Yeah, yeah. I know the quote. But you'd only be taking what is rightfully yours.

Trying to get back up, to regain what remained of his dignity? But it felt so right to just remain there. To give in. His head seemed to hurt, as if he'd just picked up a knock. His body appeared limp. And was that blood? At that moment, he couldn't care less. So many responsibilities... so much struggle... stress... it felt so blissful to leave it all behind. To finally give up when the time was right. He was ready. Just a few more minutes. To close his eyes... embrace the all-encompassing sensation of nothingness... but the noise... so much noise... unbearable, pulling him back forcefully... disturbing him in every possible way... yet he had no force to protest... he was being carried... treated... patched-up... until that empty feeling slowly faded away and the world returned. He still felt weak, but the strength was coming back. His thoughts returned, as did the will to push on. He was not going to die today. There was still so much left to do."

TOR.36.t: "New Tech, Same Old Footage"
TOR.36.desc: "Czesław Wiśniewski, the manager of one of the household appliance stores in Bydgoszcz's 'Pomorska' gallery, was three hours into his shift when the new batch of TVs arrived. The screen's sleek edges and the impressive resolution made the three-month delay on the delivery more than worth it. For a moment, he admired these technological marvels, so out of place with the bombed-out streets and bare subsistence of the city. In recent years, he'd grown used to simple makeshift radios being pretty much the only option in stock. Here, with the latest technology on the market, he felt as if the Fall had been just one bad dream. \n\nAfter placing all the TVs on their appropriate displays, Czesław set about testing whether any of them are still in working order. With the price set high enough to slip out of the income brackets of all but the most affluent citizens, he realized that they might remain in the store for quite a considerable amount of time. Might as well have some fun with them, in that case, if there was any actual reception, of which he wasn't entirely sure. \n\nCzesław grabbed one of the remotes and the screen, almost as large as the man himself, turned on, flashing a logo of the Lux Veritatis foundation. The default channel, a regional variant of TV Trwam, played a grainy, barely discernible footage of last night's Mass. Stretched to fit with the resolution, he was able to discern the individual pixels captured by the barely functional camera, and the microphone struggled to pick up a single sound without drowning it out with an obnoxious buzz. \n\nHe changed the channel - a similarly low-quality footage of a recent pilgrimage. This time, the cameraman struggled to record while in motion, making the entire feed shake uncontrollably. Again - a kitschy Spanish telenovela from the 80s about a convent of nuns embroiled in a land dispute with a local government official. Again - a children's choir performing off-key hymns in front of an audience of around 10 disinterested parents. Once more - an aerial, promotional feed of the Sanctuary, with various donation incentives and causes flashing repeatedly to a soft tune. \n\nAfter a few extra clicks, he was back to the initial channel, except the camera recording the Mass had since fallen over with nobody in the production crew noticing. Irritated, Czesław conceded on trying to find anything decent to watch, turning all TVs on for display purposes through the central control system. The priest raised his hands on fifty screens simultaneously. He began to speak. As soon as the first words left his mouth, an unbearable cacophony of sounds erupted across the store. Czesław could swear his ears were actively bleeding. He quickly turned everything off."

TOR.37.t: "The Perfect Sales Pitch"
TOR.37.desc: "The mass was ending, and the faithful were beginning to gradually shuffle out of the Church. Walking slowly, clutching her cane, Genowefa had just exited the main chamber, entering the vestibule, before a slightly overweight, balding man in his late 40s stood in her way, waving energetically towards a small collection of various objects laid out on two shelves and a massive Persian rug. He approached the attendees with his well-practiced sales pitch. \n\n- Come one, come all to your one-stop shop for all the religious merchandise you could possibly need! Crosses, holy cards, figurines; we've got it all! Three for two! Two for one! We've got sales and discounts that'll make you think I've lost my mind! Buy now and take advantage of this limited-time offer! \n\nTaking a minor detour towards the second door, Genowefa did her best to avoid the salesman. Halfway across the chamber, she took a quick, involuntary glance at the makeshift stand. As if locking onto his prey, the merchant immediately shuffled over to her, crossing her path once again. \n\n- Madam, you look like someone who can appreciate a good deal! I've got just the item for you. - He pointed to a small icon of Mary. - I can already tell this will look great in your home AND give you many blessings. \n- No, no. I'd best get going now. Dinner won't make itself. - She waved her free hand dismissively. \n- No need to worry, ma'am. I'll only take a second of your time. And you'll be glad that I did! - The salesman yanked Genowefa's arm, pulling her closer to his wares. - This vial of holy water was brought here straight from the Holy Land. It comes from the same lake that Jesus once bathed in. And for only 14,99zł, I'll throw in this exercise set with motivational bible quotes! \n- Exercise set? I think I'm slightly too old for this stuff. - She laughed politely. \n- Nonsense, madam. You don't look a day over 30! But if you're in the market for something different, feel free to take a look. \n- And what about... this? - She pointed at a brightly decorated book. \n- You've got quite a keen eye! That's the Guide to the Gospel of St. Matthew. New edition, fresh off the presses. See the back cover? If you collect the whole set, they'll form this beautiful image of the Father Director. \n- So... how much is it? \n- The standard price is 50zł, but for you, ma'am, I'm willing to give it away for 30zł. Egregiously cheap, right? Let me tell you, I'm barely breaking even! \n\nGenowefa reached into her pocket, pulling out a single 100zł note. \n\n- I'm sorry, but do you have change? I didn't bring anything smaller. - She asked in a pleading voice. \n- Well, I'm afraid I don't, but not to worry. Let's see what else I can throw in to give you the bang for your buck."

TOR.38.t: "Tithe Evasion"
TOR.38.desc: "The registrar's office, located in the modest crypt just below the main nave, felt uncomfortably damp and dark, lit up only by a set of torches and a small lightbulb hanging right above Paweł's head. A clerk in an all-black cassock sat opposite him without lifting his sight from a dusty, leather-encased book he occasionally made minor notes in. Paweł cleared his throat to get his attention. \n\n- Father, with all due respect to the quality of your record-keeping, I must report that there has been a mistake regarding my monthly tithe. \n- How so? Everything seems to be in order. - His disinterested, monotone voice betrayed signs of aging. \n- You see, so for some reason, I was allocated a tithe almost twice as large as last month. I didn't get a new job; I didn't get a promotion. This amount would be a significant burden on my family, so I really want to clear up this error. \n\nThe priest shuffled through the pages, creating a small dust cloud that made the already thick air nearly unbreathable. The slowness of his work irritated the nervous equirer, who tapped his foot impatiently. Eventually, the recordkeeper stopped and honed in on a particular line. \n\n- Ah, Paweł Bielecki. Yes, I see the issue... \n- Great, so you'll be able to correct it, and I can pay my usual amount? \n- No, not so fast. First of all, you bought yourself a new TV set. That's an increase to your media tithe. \n- Alright, but surely, that can't mean almost doubling the whole amount! \n- Of course not. Then, there is the Missed Mass Fee that you've activated once. The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a holy day of obligation, Mr. Bielecki. Besides that, we have the Offering Balancing Surcharge. We also can't forget about... \n- Fine, fine. And all of these total to...? \n- Just about 300zł, give or take. \n- Alright, that's still just a drop in the bucket compared to what you're asking me to pay. \n- And then there's also the matter of the undeclared work you're doing at your brother's repair shop. \n- You... How do you even know about that? \n- We have our sources. Now, according to the standard rate, that should amount to about a 2000zł increase to your tithe. But since you tried to deceive the parish authorities, that amount has been doubled. Seems only fair. \n- Look, I'll be in a lot of trouble if I have to pay all of this. Can't you at least waive the last 2000zł? I'll start paying for the other job, too, alright? \n- Mr. Bielecki, consider yourself lucky that we decided to resolve this matter through financial means. Others in your position would have had to deal with worse than just an increase to their tithe. I advise you to pay the full amount, as per the letter you received. The deadline ends on Sunday, so it might be best for you to hurry."

TOR.39.desc: "- You've reached rev. Sławomir Zadłużny, financial administrator of the Church of St. Nicholas the Bishop in Pieranie. How may I be of service today, Mrs. Lidia? \n- Morning, Father. I'm calling in regard to the latest payment you've submitted to the Foundation. I believe I may have found some irregularities you'd like to clear up. \n- Yes, I'm aware. We've been through this before. This time, I triple-checked that there isn't anything missing. You can read our statements. Every single source of income has been meticulously documented. \n- I know. I'm not accusing you of hiding any money, Father Zadłużny. If anything, we seem to have almost the opposite problem. \n- How so, Mrs. Lidia? \n- I need to make sure I have this correct. Could you read me the overall income figure for the past month? \n- Exactly fifteen million, seven hundred and twelve thousand, nine hundred and four złoty, rounded up. 85% of which has been transferred over, as per the statement. \n- Hmm, in that case... could you please remind me just how many taxable parishioners you have under your jurisdiction? \n- 374. Why? \n- You were able to squeeze over 15 million out of 374 people? In a single month!? \n- Impressive, isn't it? We instituted a few new tithes - transportation, consumption, church services... some other fees and penalties... There is room to optimize further, of course, but with this money, we were able to take care of all the necessary renovations and get ourselves a nice bonus; all while sending a record amount to the Father Director. I can send you the full list if you're looking to implement some of these techniques on the national level. \n- Impressive? Father Zadłużny, this is borderline criminal. I've actually taken the time to look through the most recent available tax records of your parishioners. You're taking, on average, nearly 75% of their funds. \n- Alright, so what's the problem, then? They still seem to have some left over. I haven't seen a single protest nor even a complaint. They'll make do. \n- That's it. I've heard enough. I'll be having a serious discussion with Father Rydzyk regarding your absolute lack of care for your parishioners' financial well-being. \n- Good luck, then. Make sure to send my regards. But... to spare you some embarrassment, you might want to know that he was the one who gave me the idea. Well, to be exact, he came up with the list of possible tithes. The target and the enforcement methods were all mine. \n- I highly doubt that, Father Zadłużny. Rydzyk would never extort the faithful in such a way. \n- Fine. You know what? Please do have that conversation with him. He'll be glad to hear my work is going well. Just don't say I didn't warn you. Bye, Mrs. Lidia. - The priest ended the call."

TOR.40.t: "In Service to Capital"
TOR.40.desc: "Plumes of smoke filled the lounge of a prestigious country club to the immediate northwest of Bydgoszcz. The two oligarchs, part of the handful affluent enough to afford the hefty membership fee, had just finished a round of golf, reclining by the fireplace and sipping on fine bourbon. Their cassocks, tailor-made and meticulously ironed, portrayed status far beyond their simple designs. Relaxing to the tune of soft classical music, the duo felt like kings in their own personal little fiefdom. Within it, nothing was beyond their reach, as if they'd reached their personal heaven on earth. \n\n- And to think, ten years ago we were nothing but provincial vicars. \n- Ha, no need to remind me. I was barely able to sustain myself back then. Had this little room at the presbytery in Cekcyn. I'm pretty sure two of the walls had mold patches. \n- Exactly. It's hard to believe how ungrateful people were those days. I had only eight people show up to my Mass once. In total, they gave me 10zł in offerings. \n- Well, I, for one, am glad those days are behind us. \n- Yeah, say what you will about him, Father Rydzyk has done a great job rewarding those who spend all their lives in service to the Lord. \n- Now that's a statement I can get behind. Though I hear you don't really involve yourself in the preaching business as of late. Do I have that right? \n- You do. We've just completed our third acquisition. Expanding into the railway industry takes considerable time and effort, as I'm sure you know. I simply could not squeeze evangelization into my schedule. \n- Just make sure not to become my competition. So, another grant from the big man himself? \n- Not this one. I finally got a return on my investment with that prayer terminal venture. Thought I might as well spend the money elsewhere. \n- And here I was thinking you don't have a crumb of business acumen within you. Not that I've ever had reason to think otherwise. \n- Well, times change. Nowadays, it's hard to make it out of the seminary without detailed knowledge of macroeconomics. \n- You think the new crop will have any idea how to apply them in practice? \n- Some. Most will end up bankrupt within a few months, as always. Leaves room for some pretty profitable takeovers. \n- In truth, I've got my eyes on a few of those companies already. If you want, we can sit down and pre-divide our favorites so we don't go bidding for the same one once the opportunity inevitably comes. \n- We can, but I cannot promise I will honor the agreement. You shouldn't either. We both have a reputation to maintain, after all. Can’t be going too soft. \n- Aye, I can toast to that."

TOR.41.t: "Self-Condemnation"
TOR.41.desc: "The hangover was unbearable. As if that wasn't already bad enough, the droning of the vicars standing before him only made matters worse, making Rydzyk feel as if his head was splitting in two. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't focus on a single word of their morning reports, clutching his right temple in a wince of pain whenever he attempted to pay them any attention. The extra dose of pain meds he'd taken nearly an hour ago seemed to have little to no effect, so, with irritation, more as a force of habit than as a real remedy, the priest reached for the only thing that could cure him - a tall glass of communion wine. \n\n- Father, it's not advised... not in your current state... - one of his subordinates voiced the concern they all felt. \n- Uh-huh. It's not like it's going to make anything worse than it already is. - He grumbled with annoyance. \n- I've spoken with your doctor... he's pretty adamant that you refrain from exerting yourself. \n- I don't know if you've noticed, but apparently this whole place is about to fall apart the moment I try to step away for even a second, so it might be best if you stop with all the advice and just let me do as I please. - He downed the glass rapidly. It brought him some comfort. \n- If I could only have one suggestion... when was the last time you visited the confessional, Father? It might be best to prepare to enter the Kingdom of Heaven with a clean soul. \n- Already planning my demise, are you? I'll have you know that I'm still going strong. Besides, they wouldn't let me in even after a thousand confessions. There's no point in trying. \n- We're well aware that your situation may be difficult, but Jesus himself said it's never too late to repent. If you shun all mortal pleasures, there might still be time for you. \n- Bah. And you honestly believe that? I've burned that bridge a long time ago. I'm not going to go through the effort of building it back up again. This life suits me just fine. I'm not going to lie and pretend I'm someone I'm not. Especially not before God. \n- So, despite your service to the faith, you condemn yourself to an eternity of suffering? \n- Jerzy, honestly, look me in the eyes and tell me whether you think I've ever deserved to enter Heaven. None of us here does. At least I've lived long enough to no longer delude myself about it. You'll realize it too, eventually."

In the early morning, his parish priest asked him to pick up a replacement thurible from the manufacturer on the other side of the Complex. Unless his watch suddenly began to run amok, it was already nearly 17:00, barely more than an hour until dusk. For the first two hours, the deacon tried following the imposing defensive wall towering over the entire area. Now, no matter how far into the distance he looked, he wasn't even able to spot it in any direction. \n\nDetermined to complete his task, Jedliński passed through the narrow alleyways, increasingly feeling like he had already passed by these same stores at least twice before. As much as he hated to admit it, he was lost, without even managing to find the place he was looking for. Perched against one of the buildings, he retrieved a hastily drawn map in an attempt to reorient himself. It hadn't yet been updated to include his current section. \n\n- You're in the wrong part of the Complex, ain't ya, boy? - An elder approached the deacon with an expression of genuine care. \n- I... suppose so. What is this place? I don't have it anywhere on my map. \n- Yeah, figures. You won't find it on any records, not official ones at least. Rydzyk wants to forget it ever existed. \n- Wait, but why? \n- A lot of folks don't make the cut. Most of them eventually end up here. Trust me, you don't want to spend more time in this place than you have to. \n- And you? \n- Eh, I'll be fine. I run a small workshop just around the corner. Try to keep at least some of the boys here off the streets, give them any sort of alternative, you know. You can stay there for the night. It's one of the only safe spots in this entire neighborhood. I'll arrange for someone to escort you back to your parish by morning. \n- Hold on, let me at least reimburse you for your trouble. - Deacon Jedliński reached for his satchel. - Damn it, where’s my... \n- Your wallet? Ha, guess someone must have nicked it from you already. Happens a lot around here. At this point, it’s almost an initiation ritual of sorts. \n- But I need to get it back. \n- You don’t. Consider yourself lucky that it’s only your wallet you’re missing. Could’ve been a lot worse. If I were you, I wouldn’t lift a finger trying to find it. Your life’s far more valuable than whatever you had in there. Just enjoy your rest. Someone will come for you at dawn."

By now, he was thoroughly used to Rydzyk’s expensive tastes, but every day he had to spend logging in truckloads of goods on the checklist he was barely able to staple together always served to remind him of the sheer volume of items the Father Director regularly requested. Every time he thought he had seen it all, he was greeted by yet another product that seemed to be impossible to obtain within the war-torn country. The incessant pace of the entire process left him little time to ponder this issue. In the time he wasted briefly considering the implications, he had already caused a significant traffic jam. Trying to restore order, he walked up to the first truck in line to see what the issue was.\n\n- Why the holdup? Cmon. Keep it moving. \n- I ain't moving 'til I get my money. If Rydzyk thinks he can shaft us, he's thoroughly mistaken. This shipment ain't here as some sort of voluntary offering. This is a business deal, yeah? If he wants his stuff, he'd better pay for it, and I'm staying right here in this spot until he does so. \n- All payments are handled by the Complex’s import office. Go there after the completion of your final delivery of this month and you’ll be given your pre-agreed amount. - Laskosz spoke in a monotonous tone, rife with boredom. \n- Mhm, guess where I just was. \n- I’m sure we can get to the bottom of this. What sort of cargo were you carrying? \n- You do not want to know the answer to that question, trust me. \n- Regrettably, I will have to. I’m gonna need to see your contract. \n- Fine, your own risk. Here you go. \n\nLaskosz took a brief moment to examine the paper, his eyes widening in shock as he exhaled deeply, trying to maintain an official tone. \n\n- Yes, I... can see why you weren't particularly eager to reveal this information. So that... is something that the Father Director requested? \n- I have his personal signature. Just a product, like any other. I don't ask who wants it and for what purposes. \n- And you're carrying... how many?\n- 100. As per the contract. \n- Per month? \n- Mhm. \n- Eh, may the Lord have mercy. Yes, I see the issue. Apparently you're supposed to deliver that amount daily... \n- Daily? Cmon. That's insane. Why would anyone need that many... You know what, I'm not even going to ask. I can't do that. You know how hard this is to acquire? This is all I could get. I'm getting ripped off here. \n- That's your problem to figure out. You signed the contract.

I thank you for receiving me at such short notice. I am troubled, Father, and I wish to once again have a clean soul. My sins include: \n\nHe could feel it, just like every other time. That weakness, the shortness of breath. The burden of guilt is often easy to ignore. When confronted, it leaves its imprint on the conscience.

For some, having to speak their crimes before the highest authority remains a paralyzing pressure. \n\n- Vanity. \n\nBy now, he was so used to living in its ways, the words came out almost automatically, having lost all their meaning. \n\n- False testimony. \n\n37 counts, not that he could remember them all. Some - a necessity for the greater good. Most, purely cynical for his own personal gain. In his mind, they all meshed together into one undetermined greyness. \n\n- Greed. \n\nA condemnation as murky as possible to hide the severity of the sin. As if everything would be forgiven because it managed to slip past the confessor. As if convincing him was all it took. He tried not to dwell too much on the idea that it is someone else who would eventually be the judge. \n\n- Embezzlement... \n- Again? Janek, you cannot keep doing that. \n\nThe sudden denunciation ripped Król right out of his trance, filling him with anger. \n\n- Excuse me? What did you just say? \n- A true confession is not complete without a genuine determination to atone. It might be good to... at least consider making a change. \n- Are you seriously accusing me of not making an effort? \n- You come to me every couple of days with the same list of sins as always. I speak only out of genuine concern for your soul. \n- And what do you know about running a Church the size of an entire state, huh!? What do you know about the sacrifices it takes!? I deserve to have something in return for this thankless job. I pay you good money to sit here and listen whenever I need penitence. I don't need your lectures. \n- Yes, you can make me say anything you like.

Father Król, tense and exhausted after weeks of wrangling the clergy into supporting him, knew he’d have to be the one to open. \n\n- So, I heard you have some... alternative ideas about who should be in charge. - He leaned forward inquisitively. \n- Perhaps. I just don't think you have the charisma, Janek. No offense, but you don't hold a candle to Father Rydzyk. We've got a good thing going here. Don't want to risk it all backing a suboptimal candidate. \n- And do you think this candidate could perhaps... do something to change your mind? - He was angry. The priest gritted his teeth in between words. Why did he have to prove himself to someone far less relevant and influential than he? \n- Hmm, I'm not sure. You'll find that I can be pretty... difficult to convince. - Father Cisoń was clearly enjoying himself. \n- You know, I always like to do the rounds around the Sanctuary. Just this morning, I found these two gorgeous luxury cars parked right by the entrance. A miracle, don't you think? But you see, now I have this problem: I have no use for them myself, and I have nobody to give them to. For the right guarantees, they could be yours. \n- Cmon, I know you can do far better than that. I saw you give one of those to a seminarist recently. But if I’m to believe you’re capable of leading this entire Church going forward... that would require something special, wouldn’t it? \n- What sort of incentive are you expecting, then? \n- Well, you could say I’ve got it all, but there are some things... you just can’t quite put a price tag on. \n- Such as? - Król was getting visibly annoyed. \n- Recognition. Influence. I’ve spent too long on the sidelines, Janek. Make me head of the Academy, and all your opposition will disappear overnight. It’s that simple. \n- That position is already filled. \n- By Father Klafka? In a few years, he’ll be long past it. You’d be doing him a favor. Retiring right after Rydzyk’s passing... sounds honorable, doesn’t it? \n- That's quite a considerable favor you're demanding. And if I don't take that deal? \n- In that case... I guess I'd still have my doubts regarding your leadership. So, I'd have to act accordingly, for the good of the Church. Trust me, you don't want that. \n- Ugh, fine.

Throughout my research on the topic, I realized just how much of these condemnations are the slanderous result of both former and current anti-religious trends and just how poorly the expectation of clerical poverty holds up against the Church's actual doctrine. So, let's dive into just how wealth-holding priests became a wider societal taboo, and what can be done to reassert their rightful image. But first, I would like to thank the video's sponsor..."

TOR.47.desc: "- So this really is it, huh? Are you sure you don't want to keep going? - Król asked with a slight sense of worry. \n- Ha, I wish. But it's time. After forty years, I'm finally ready to move on. You must've waited for this moment for quite a long time, Janek. - The aging priest laughed compassionately at the idea, breaking into a minor coughing fit afterwards. \n- If only. Can I be honest with you for a second? \n- Of course, always. - His sympathy towards his long-time companion was genuine, far different from the fake smiles he forced himself into in front of the faithful. \n- If anything, I'm worried. All this time, you've held the community together. All these people - they absolutely adore you. You personally. I've been one step behind you from the start, but I don't think I can ever BE you. I doubt anyone could. \n- You don't have to. You've already been handling most of the work. This Church is just as much of your creation as it is mine. \n- That's not something the people know, though. They mostly see me as just another one of your loyalists. Sure, I can take care of all the administrative business, keep things running just as they always have, but I'm far from the face of the Church. \n- They'll learn to love you in time. It was a rough start for me as well. - Rydzyk tried to say reassuringly. \n- We don't have the time for a rough transition. We could lose it all if anything goes wrong. Are you sure you aren't able to stay for just a while longer? \n- I'm really never going to get to retire, am I? - Another laugh, again turning into a series of coughs, this time louder than before. - But if I'm to stay at the helm, then that's all that I'm doing. I've already done enough. Let me at least enjoy the final years of my life. I don't have all that many left. \n- Thank you. I'll make sure to take care of everything you need. \n- One thing, though. You've had four decades to build your own personal brand. Eventually, I'm not going to be there anymore. Eventually, you'll have to represent the Church all on your own. I'm giving you some extra time, but from now on, you'll have to actually start getting ready to replace me. \n- I wish that weren't the case, but... I'll try to do my best. \n- I'll make sure to check up on you from time to time. You said it yourself - it's still my Church, after all. I've got to make sure it stays on the right track. - Rydzyk smiled with a genuine pride."

TOR.48.desc: "Two young men, dressed all in black, stepped out of their Camaro onto the shoulder of the DW246 intercounty road. Dark clouds hovered above their heads, and the village air filled their nostrils. They wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. Jacek opened the trunk and got out the necessary equipment. \n\n- You sure that's the right place? Could just as well be any other crossroads in the middle of nowhere. \n- What else do you expect from some roadside shrine? You read the assignment, right? Consider yourself lucky that you get to replace Rydzyk in at least one of his duties. \n- Well, since he's the one maintaining it, I'm expecting something truly special. So far, this place just looks abandoned. \n\nAfter looking around for a few minutes, they spotted a small, knocked-over cross lying to the side of a slightly raised embankment. Unless some cataclysm had miraculously passed through the area unnoticed in the past few days, it had likely been forgotten a long time ago. \n\n- That can't be it, can it? \n- Nothing else matches the description. There must be some reason, surely. Maybe the shrine was vandalized recently. \n- Ugh, there's like a few dozen empty beer bottles lying everywhere. This is an absolute mess. \n- Check the dates. Maybe they'll tell us when all of this happened. \n- You know what? I'd rather not touch any of that, but it's not like I have a choice. Let's see... wow, these are old. \n- How old? \n- I don't think half of these brands are even still in production. This place hasn't been maintained since at least before the Fall. \n- No, cmon. That can't be right. 'Custodian of the Klepary Shrine' is part of Rydzyk's official title. You know, the long one. There's no way he left it to rot. \n- Eh, cut him some slack. He's got his years. You really expect him to remember all his duties? This one can't be high up on the list. \n- Jacek, tell me, and be honest. We've been to quite a few places now, right? Out of all the responsibilities we took care of, did you get the feeling that at least one of them hadn't been neglected? \n- Not... really. Not that I can remember, at least. \n- Exactly! I've been thinking, and I know this is gonna sound borderline blasphemous, but what does Rydzyk actually do? It's been a long time since I've last seen him doing anything productive. \n- You're right. It is blasphemous. \n- Huh, you're not going to report me for this, are you? \n- Not this time. Get the gloves. You're picking up the bottles; I'll reassemble the shrine."

TOR.49.desc: "Precisely 15 minutes after eight, Mariola was on her way to do her morning shopping trip. With difficulty, she carried her Rolser along the bumpy pavement, limping for over 20 minutes on a stretch normally covered in around seven. Starting to experience the familiar pressure in her chest she often felt after more than a few hundred meters of walking, she paused by the entrance to the 'Tysiąclecia' Park to catch her breath. After briefly resting, she spotted her friend walking in her direction. Keeping up appearances, scared she might otherwise appear overly senile, Mariola continued walking, trying to ignore the crushing pain that still hadn't fully gone away. Relatively quickly, the two caught up to each other. \n\n- Have you heard, Halinka? Rydzyk is retiring. - She was almost out of breath. \n- Honestly, good for him. He’s really been withering away lately. He deserves some rest in his old age. \n- Aren’t you worried? I don’t know; maybe I’ve just gotten so used to him being around, but I can hardly imagine all of this functioning without him. \n- We’ll be in good hands. Father Król will make sure the Church keeps running smoothly. We’ll all miss Rydzyk, of course, but realistically, not much will change. \n- Is it confirmed already? \n- I think so. They’ve been sounding off about it pretty much everywhere lately. Haven’t you heard? \n- I’m... not sure. Something flashed up, I think. - She couldn’t remember. Maybe her own age was starting to show, she thought with worry. \n- Well, he’s been with Rydzyk since the start. We’re lucky to have someone like him carrying on the legacy. \n- Yes, Król... I actually bumped into him a few times before, if you could believe it. \n- Still the lucky one, aren’t you? So, how was it? \n- Surprisingly unremarkable. Don’t get me wrong, he seems nice, says the right things, and is closer to the Father Director’s teachings than any of the other priests, but I just don’t see it. He’s not the leader type. \n- Surely you cannot doubt Rydzyk’s judgement. He knows him far better than we do. If he says he’s up to the task, there must be something we’re missing. \n- I hope so. He’s been coming out of his shell lately, but that can only accomplish so much. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever met someone so uncharismatic. \n- May the Lord protect us, then. We have some tough years ahead of us. \n\nAfter the conversation concluded, Halina stopped, sitting on a nearby bench. Her hip needed some rest before they could continue. Seeing her friend equally struggle with her daily tasks gave Mariola some reassurance. The slow march of time was catching up to everyone. Eventually, others would take their place."

TOR.50.desc: "- Of course, Mr. Ćwikieł. Keep going. What else can you remember? - Sławomir Mentzen calmly sipped a glass of water as he noted down his interlocutor’s confessions. \n- And then... they forced me out of my home. Tore up my lease to make more room for their complex. No compensation. I was homeless for almost a year afterwards. Do you understand what that does to a person? \n- I’m sure it must have been an incredibly traumatic time for you, sir. Once we begin settling Rydzyk’s accounts, we’ll make sure you’ll be properly reimbursed. \n\nAn assistant knocked urgently on the office’s glass door before coming in. He appeared visibly disturbed, his skin nearly turning pale. \n- Sławek, we’ve got a problem. \n- What is it this time, Arek? Some issue with the accounts? \n- Our cameras by the station picked up some activity. Unmarked, likely armed, heading this way. We’re about to have visitors. \n\nSensing danger, Mentzen immediately got up and headed to the main lobby, hurriedly summoning every available worker. \n\n- Alright, everyone. Looks like we’re about to be on the receiving end of a severe audit. Rydzyk’s thugs are heading this way as we speak. We’ve got about five minutes, maybe seven if we can slightly delay them. You know the procedure. Boxes with evidence against the Church authorities are to be hidden in locked compartments, out of possible view. I’m giving each one of you a client file. Make sure to look like you were in the middle of processing it. Act natural and avoid doing anything suspicious. \n- Sławek, we don’t have the time. These guys are not out here to play. It looks like one of his merc teams. They’ll comb through everything we’ve got and if they find anything incriminating, we’re all done for. \n- Damn it. Fine, change of plans. This is going to set us back by months. I need everything that isn’t part of our daily operations in the shredder. Or destroyed any other way. Whatever it takes. We don’t have the time. Now! Move out, cmon! \n\nHe returned to his office, ready to quickly torch all the problematic documents. His guest still sat at the desk cluelessly, shifting nervously. \n\n- Ugh, I forgot about you. Fuck, you can’t just leave now. Too suspicious. They’d ask you questions until you break. Listen, from now on, you’re a small business owner who came here asking for advice regarding his CIT tax form. Got it? Just sign this. - He handed the client a pre-filled sheet of paper. \n\nA series of loud bangs startled Mentzen. The time had run out. He slowly opened the door, utter pandemonium still happening behind his back. He could only hope they’d done enough. \n\n- Ah, Father Bortkiewicz! What a pleasant surprise!"

Despite the body's authority not extending beyond the members' self-imposed discipline and the sum of their meager contributions, even the smallest of debated changes tended to stir a flurry of emotions among the attendees. After a 30-minute shouting match about new trash sorting guidelines, they were finally ready to continue. \n\n- Alright, everybody. I see the tensions have slightly abated, so let's now move to the next issue on the docket: What are we to do with the seedlings on Witkowskiego? \n- First of all, whose idea was it to plant these!? And why did nobody consult me? Half my driveway is blocked off now! - A woman butted in, exasperated. \n- Klaudia, they are literally like 10 meters away from your property. You probably can't even tell the difference. \n- How dare you tell ME whether I'm able to use MY driveway!? I think I know better what is and isn't... \n\nThe door opened forcefully, and a priest came into the room with an escort of 5 armed law enforcement officials. He looked at the gathering, scowling and turning his head disapprovingly. \n\n- Father Laskosz! Have you come to join our meeting? Members of the clergy are always welcome to contribute. - The chairman began nervously. \n- It saddens me to see such duplicity in your hearts, brothers. You claim to follow the divine right of our authorities, and yet you conspire to replace them with your own.  \n- Huh? No, no, Father. We fully adhere to the decrees of the Church; we're only here to discuss local issues, unworthy of your attention. \n- And by doing so, you claim that we're unable to address them. Your lack of faith is showing, as are the fruits of your betrayal. \n- We... we fully submit ourselves to your divinely sanctioned will, it's just that... there were many things that had previously gone unaddressed; we wanted only to take care of our community, without needlessly bothering the Church, which already has so many responsibilities. \n- And so, the serpent has revealed its true intentions. Don't think I didn't catch that accusation. We have resolved every matter that needed attention, precisely when it was appropriate. I will not allow this treacherous lack of gratitude to stand. - He turned toward the armed escort. - Take them. We'll make sure everyone here learns not to challenge His decree."

Getting the Bavarian Mountain Hound was initially far from the middle manager's top priority; if anything, it was a concession to his 8-year-old son for successfully completing his first year of primary school, but he had since grown attached to Luna. After spending some time playing fetch in the park, Adrian was finally making his way back home. As always, he decided to take a shortcut through the Church grounds, saving him a grand total of about 30 seconds. A distant shout caused him to halt immediately, his body tensing in shock. \n\n- Oi! The fuck you think you're doin' in 'ere? -  A short, burly man with a shaved head spat out in a blind rage. \n- Just... umm... walking my dog. Didn't mean to trespass. Sorry. I'll be on my way. - He stuttered his words in fear as a band of five aggressive hooligans cornered him against the gate. \n- You think we’re stupid, huh? You think we don't know what you're up to? \n- What... am I up to? I really didn't mean any harm. \n- Uh-huh. See? These idiots always deny it. Every single time. Fuckin' brainless hooligans, wanting to deface our beautiful Church. And for what? Hateful scum, every single one of them. \n- C... can I please go now? I understand the message. You've got the wrong guy. I'm a good Christian, just like you all. Every Sunday, I never skip Mass. \n- Siwy, you were at the Mass. You seen this guy? \n- Nah, can't say I have. - He had. He was just looking for a scrap. \n- My friend here says you ain't been to the Mass. You callin' my friend a liar? \n- No, uhh... maybe we were on the opposite ends of the church... \n- You see, Siwy's got good eyesight. You sayin' there's somethin' wrong with his eyesight? \n- Yeah, show us what's in the bag. - A weasely guy, forcibly lowering his tone to sound tough, chimed in. \n- N... nothing. Just some groceries I got on the way. \n- He said it clearly, didn't he? Show us what's in the fucking bag! - The leader took back the mantle. \n\nThe thug snapped Adrian's bag out of his hand and threw it to the ground. He commanded one of his goons to look through the contents, which mostly spilled all over the ground for everyone to see.

Both eyed him with contempt, looking for any signs of weakness, subtly enjoying their suspect’s discomfort. They waited until he had been sufficiently softened up before beginning. \n\n- Quite the heat we’ve got today, haven’t we? I can fetch you some water if you’d like. \n- Sure, but uhh... could you tell me what this is all about? I need to pick up my son from class in around 2 hours. I can’t really stay here for long. \n- Uh-huh. You might want to get someone else to do that for you while you still can. You won’t be going home today, Mr. Siemieniuk. I can tell you that. \n- Hold on, you can’t do this. I didn’t do anything. I have my rights. \n- Oh, cut the crap. - He banged his fist against the table. - We have three separate witness testimonies accusing you of blasphemy and corroborating video evidence placing you at the scene of the crime. This conversation is just a formality. \n- I still don't understand what this is about. You must have the wrong guy. \n- Two Sundays ago, Church of the Holy Ghost. Ring a bell now, huh? \n- Not... particularly. I was at Mass then, like every Sunday. What about it? \n- You skipped communion, didn't you? Remember what you said then? 'Go ahead. I haven't been to the confessional in quite a while. It wouldn't be right of me to take it.' \n- O... kay... and? \n- Still no remorse, huh? - The interrogator appeared almost disgusted. - I'm going to enjoy seeing godless scum like you locked up for a looong time. \n- Godless? I'm still a Christian. How I practice my faith is my own private matter. \n- It is a private matter until you start blaring your anti-religious propaganda for the whole congregation to hear. I won't tolerate you casually diminishing the importance of regular penitence in the middle of such a sacred place. \n- I never said that it's a good thing. I wasn't even planning for anyone besides my family to hear it... \n- Sure. Even if; you're still instilling harmful values into them. They'll be better off without you.

TOR.54.t: "The Council of Toruń"
TOR.54.desc: "From the start, Pastor Dariusz Kaproń's best instinct was to stay as far away from Rydzyk as possible. Thanks to the lack of any significant intersection between the two Churches, the Pentecostals and Redemptorists have mostly been able to coexist in peace, aside from some occasional minor tensions. No communication, no evangelizing. Therefore, the open invitation to a non-binding liturgical synod came as a significant surprise. \n\nAfter a slight delay, the top brass of Kuyavia’s religious organizations took their seats at the specially prepared round-table. The building of the Academy in which they convened was largely unimposing, deliberately kept outmoded despite the generous funding flowing into each of Rydzyk's ventures. A noticeable anticipation could be felt among the attendees, with careful optimism at the prospect of being included in the larger doctrinal discussion. Even before the official portion of the event was set to begin, a number of smaller conversations had broken out between the representatives, as Pastor Kaproń found himself debating a number of key issues with the leader of the local Seventh-day Adventists' delegation. In this broader atmosphere of theological debate, most failed to notice the absence of one key guest, namely the Father Director himself. A quarter of an hour later, a small armed unit forced its way into the auditorium, with Father Klafka proudly looming over the concerned visitors. \n\n- Welcome, everyone. You have all been invited here to accomplish what had always been deemed impossible: mend the schism afflicting our Churches; find a common way of worship, as in the times of Christ. During the preparations for our gathering, I have consulted with the most authoritative religious scholars. Regrettably, they have confirmed our previous suspicions: the differences in your doctrine are purely heretical. Yet I do not see you as false prophets, for you, too, have only been misled. \n\nAt these words, one by one, the soldiers handed each attendee a small paper slip. \n\n- Before you lies the only path to redemption, brothers. Sign this and bask in the Lord's light, as in Heaven, so, too, on Earth. Many privileges await those who serve a greater purpose, and those who eagerly convert their astray congregations will be met with handsome rewards. However, let it be known that those who continue to deceive will not be met with tolerance. Do not be surprised if unfortunate events follow your every step, for such is God's will. I will now leave you to make your choice. \n\nPastor Kaproń stared at the document in front of him. \n\n'I hereby admit to having been tainted by heresy and declare all deviations from the Redemptorist doctrine as going against God's vision. I submit wholly to the Father Director's judgement, repent, and beg him for forgiveness. I expect the same from every member of my congregation and vow to preach to the best of my ability to bring them back into the light.' \n\nHe considered his options carefully. He gauged the overall atmosphere. He prayed for the Lord to forgive him. With regret, he signed the slip."

Two aides waited just out of view, ready to rush in in case he were to fall. His heart burned with nostalgia, remembering the now-distant past, when his sermons used to be a weekly occurrence... then monthly... every three months... he hadn't had the strength to return for over half a year now. Even with the microphone before him boosted as far as it could go, he could hardly be heard over the hundreds of curious murmurs. The energy was long gone; so was the charisma, but he was determined to give those who had followed him for nearly half a century a proper send-off. \n\n- My dears, I have awaited this day with the deepest concern. Seeing you all here only makes the decision even more difficult. You see, eventually, there comes a day when you realize your time has come.  And though you try to hide it from yourself, soon, the increasing burden becomes impossible not to notice. If I physically could, I would stay with you for another few decades, if not more. For I am nothing without you, and you are nothing without me. Yet it is God's plan that I must leave you in such a trying time. Fear not, and trust His will, as we know He has only the best interests of our community at heart. But for those who are still filled with worry, be assured that as long as I draw breath, I will remain in your service. Now and forever. Amen. \n\nNearly out of breath, Rydzyk quickly concluded his final speech after hearing the crowd's impassioned Amen. With considerable difficulty, he made a near-full turn and began heading toward the sacristy to rest. \n\nA woman stood up in the fifth row, rushing at the priest with surprising agility, not ready to let the paragon of her devotion disappear into the aether. Intervening quickly, a row of altar boys blocked the way, forcefully pushing the intruder back. As if lost in a trance, with every second, more and more people pressed against their impromptu cordon, hoping to receive their own personal farewell or a final blessing from the Father Director. With the line threatening to break, the aides took Rydzyk by the arms and quickly escorted him out. The swarm was left to occupy the empty altar."

Eventually, what once seemed overwhelming became routine as he began to consider himself a natural part of the clerical family. The regular weekend visits were Dawid's only tether to his old life. Acquiring the papers to leave and re-enter the structure was often a hassle, but even he needed the occasional break from the hermetic atmosphere within the Sanctuary. A few days ago, he was informed about the upcoming state of seclusion. \n\nIn the brief time window he was afforded, Dawid did his best to cram in all the necessary preparations. Bidding a temporary farewell to his parents, he transferred all remaining belongings and funds to his far-from-spacious room within the seminarists' assigned living quarters. Still, standing at the main and final remaining open entry point into the Complex, he couldn't help but shed a sorrowful tear when listening to Father Laskosz. \n\n- Dear brethren, we are gathered here on this momentous occasion to welcome a new chapter in the history of our Church. The Father Director, long may he be in good health, has decreed that from this moment forth, the Sanctuary will close its gates to the unworthy. For too long has the Church been merely an attraction. For too long have those whose lives have little to do with faith desecrated our most sacred places with their presence. Rejoice, for you have been chosen to serve in comfort among the righteous. \n\nAn enthusiastic, unplanned 'Amen!' resonated among the more seasoned side of the delegation. \n\n- From now on, all communication with the outside world will be handled through official channels. You are free to put whatever you need on the list of delivery requests. No effort will be spared to ensure you are all provided for. Rydzyk will make sure you get to live like kings. But first, the formality. Guards, close the gates! \n\nThe sun shone brightly, painting the forest outside a pleasant green hue. Birds chirped softly, their melody interrupted by the loud creaks of the metal gate. Four members of the security detail pushed with all their might to get the heavy doors to budge as the view of the outside slowly narrowed until, eventually, the clergy's self-confinement became absolute. Dawid let out a fearful sigh. He couldn't tell when, or if, he would ever get to see beyond these gates again."

His throat, already sore in the evening, burned unbearably with every gulp, and the fever that had rocked him for the past few days once again enflared, making him feel every bone, every tissue, every muscle that even as much as dared move within the past week. With difficulty, the priest sat up on the corner of the bed, determined to at least get a glass of water and some pain meds to quell some of the more unbearable symptoms. He got up shakily, holding the frame for leverage. With as wide a stance as possible to maintain any semblance of balance, he slowly dragged his feet through the door, entering the narrow corridor. \n\nThe outside of his room felt... different. Unfamiliar, as if he had just stumbled upon it for the first time in his life. With every step, the hallway lengthened, forcing him further and further away from his destination. He could tell he was walking in a straight line, yet the pathways wound without end. And that throat still continued to burn. He turned, turned yet again, continuing forward and yet returning to the same spot. If only he could lie back down... the journey was not worth it. He could sleep through the night somehow... \n\nBut he could no longer tell where he was. The building - it felt so strangely... familiar. He was back. Back in Olkusz. Back in his family home. He hadn't seen it in so long. Two figures sat on the front porch, calling out to him lovingly. He passed by an old neighbor's house, still in perfect condition. He was almost there... yet a dark figure blocked his path. \n\n- Are you alright, Father Rydzyk? You shouldn't be up at this hour. - A young clergyman asked with concern. \n- Who... are you? Why are you in my way, young man? \n- Father Director, I'm Jakub, your personal assistant. I check up on you every few hours. Are you sure you don't remember me? \n- I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about. Can you please let me go? I was told not to talk to strangers. \n- Hmm, that's really not good. Father Rydzyk, you need to go back to your bed. You'll feel better in the morning. \n- But I'm almost home. Can you take me home? \n- I'll uh... sure, just take my hand.

The parchment, spilling from nearly all sides of the priest’s workspace, had been cut down to a slightly more manageable size, displaying only Kuyavia’s most immediate surroundings, with the discarded bits still scattered around the room. Lines made with a pack of colored markers crisscrossed the region, further cutting it up into hundreds of little pieces of varying importance, each carrying a title, influence, as well as extraordinary wealth, should its owner manage to properly exploit it. The dioceses and their subordinate parishes carried power unlike anything else in the country. Those who received a piece could consider themselves eternally blessed. One such recipient was about to make his way through the door. \n\n- You called for me, Janek? - Klafka entered with a limp, struggling to sit down straight on the opposite end of the desk. \n- Yes, have a drink. - He poured himself and the minister a glass of the sacramental wine. - I figured a celebration is in order after your recent promotion. \n- What promotion? I haven’t been informed of any rearrangements within the administration. \n- We’re still ironing out the details. I just didn’t want to send you off without a proper goodbye. It might be a while before we see each other again. \n- Send me off? I have been a loyal servant of Rydzyk for over two decades! You can’t just get rid of me! \n- So have we all. But there comes a time when our best years are gone and our service no longer becomes necessary. \n- You have no authority to make that call. I’m still perfectly capable of holding my position. Just wait until Rydzyk hears of this! \n- I think you’ll quickly find he’s no longer the one calling the shots. You answer to me now, so be thankful I managed to save you a comfortable little retirement spot. \n- Uh-huh. Where? \n- The Decanate of Rogowo. Cozy, picturesque... \n-... and just as far from Toruń as you could possibly cram me. You really have no shame. \n- Yes, far from the media cycle. Which means nobody will bat an eye at what you do within your territory. \n- And what of the Academy? \n- Father Cisoń has assured me that out of respect for your tremendous body of work, he will humbly accept filling the vacancy. \n- Cisoń... the whole thing was his idea, wasn’t it? \n- I’d rather not divulge the contents of personal arrangements. \n- So it is true. You’ve made a terrible mistake here, Janek. You replaced a good, pious man with an amoral opportunist. \n- Perhaps. But that is no longer something you need to worry about. Enjoy your retirement. I’ll try to visit on occasion."

TOR.59.desc: "The church overflowed with the hundreds of gathered faithful, the pews filled elbow to elbow as the mass of people spilled beyond the entrance. Father Szewczuk was in the midst of yet another fiery sermon about the necessity of sacrifice in the times of war, perhaps one of his best oratorical performances, but nobody paid his words any attention. Instead, the eyes of the congregation focused on the centerpiece sitting atop the altar - a glass bowl filled with innumerable folded paper notes. In the minds of the terrified parishioners, the priest’s speech dragged, as each second only prolonged their uncertainty. All they cared about was whether they’d be chosen. \n\n- My dear brethren, it warms my heart to see you all gathered here for this momentous occasion. Regrettably, only a few among you will be blessed with the honor of fighting in the name of the faith. And worry not about the fate of our champions, for my hand is guided by the Lord to pick the most apt and able among you. No harm shall befall anyone under His protection. \n\nThe priest dipped his hand in the bowl, giving it a good, performative swirl, pulling a single card out from the bottom. \n\n- By the will of God, I call upon Czesław Koźlak to fight in His name. \n\nA surprised murmur spread among the crowd. A middle-aged man spoke out. \n\n- Czesiek? He’s pushing sixty now. And he’s got a bad case of arthritis. He’s in no shape to fight. \n- The Lord works in mysterious ways. We do not question his judgment. If he deems the man fit to fight, who are we to declare otherwise? \n\nHe pulled out another card, more hastily this time. \n\n- By the will of God, I call upon Kasia Herbik to fight in His name. \n- Father, she’s only had her first communion last month. You can’t take her! - A concerned mother cried out. \n- To serve does not only mean to fight on the frontlines. There are many non-combat roles she could fill.  \n- She’s only eight! \n- That is not my decision, but that of the Divine. He knows something we do not. What we must do is trust Him. \n\nThe priest grabbed the third slip. \n\n- By the will of God, I call upon Łucjan Leśniak to fight in His name. \n- That’s... my father. He’s been dead for almost six years now. \n- Is there any other Łucjan Leśniak in this parish? - Father Szewczuk asked the congregation in irritation. A silence followed as the priest pointed towards the gathered. \n\n- It appears the Lord is preoccupied with other matters today. First row, you get to serve in the army. The rest of you will have to wait for your turn."

He looked around nervously. He could tell they had deviated from their intended path, now speeding along some unmarked dirt road in the middle of nowhere. The boy felt a sudden pang of anxiety. They had already departed late, and with this sudden detour, they were almost certainly going to miss their match. Maybe if they skipped the warm-up... But where were they heading? Did the driver get lost? \n\nTwenty minutes had passed. The road has gotten narrower, eventually opening up into a large forest clearing. In the distance, he could see an encampment. From a bit closer, regular salvoes of shots. Dominik twitched in fear. Even closer - shouts, commands, drills. The Church was gearing up for war. Despite the shoddy state of the training base, the boy felt a certain awe. He could not know just how makeshift it all was. Not yet, at least. \n\nThe bus stopped thirty meters past the entrance, the gates immediately closing behind it. The team's coach ushered the apprehensive boys out in a double file onto a small grassy square. The unit's chaplain approached them, holding a hefty wad of cash in one hand and an antique wooden box in the other.  \n\n- 15... 16... 17. You're one short. We agreed on 18. \n- Called in sick this morning. Said he can't come. Delaying would've been far too risky. - The coach explained himself, worrying that this issue might derail the deal. \n- I'll have to dock that from your reward. - The priest continued, putting a few of the bills back into his pocket. - But good work otherwise. You've done an invaluable service to the faith. We welcome your further cooperation in the future. \n\nThe chaplain opened the wooden coffret, placing a medallion with the image of Mary on each of the boys' necks. He performed the sign of the cross above them. \n\n- The Blessed Virgin protects the souls of the righteous. You have been bestowed the honour of joining the Lord's army. Wear this medallion at all times, and no harm shall ever befall you from sinners' hands. Their bullets will swerve around you, and those that hit will melt against your skin. Persist in innocence, cleanse yourselves from all worldly evils, and you will always remain in Her favor. \n\nOne of the boys broke away from the group, trying to escape the compound. Halfway to the gate, he was apprehended by the guards and brought back. The priest shook his head disapprovingly. \n\n- How pitiful. So young, yet already so tainted by Satan's corruption. Do not worry. In a few weeks, we'll remove this godless rot from your heart. In the meantime, we could all use some additional target practice. Let it serve as an additional incentive to convert.  \n\nHe put three additional banknotes back into his pocket. \n\n- This will impact the reward, however. Damaged goods. I'm sure you understand. You can count the rest. I'll get in touch should there be further complaints."

In the sacristy, the liturgical team was preparing for their entrance in the absence of Father Zielny, scrambling to fill in for the notoriously absent priest. In the distance, tires screeched as a fresh, new Porsche parked in one of the spots behind the building, revving its engine performatively. Obnoxiously loud, bass-boosted rap blared from its custom-installed speakers for the entire church to hear. The key turned, stopping the ungodly music. Two minutes later, Father Zielny slammed open the doors to the sacristy. \n\n- ‘sup? Did you miss me? Aight, let’s get this mass over with. I’ve got places to be. \n\nThe others looked at the priest in confusion. \n\n- What? Is this how you welcome me back? - He adjusted his premium, gold-covered watch. \n- You left without a warning two months ago and haven’t even contacted us once while you were gone. We thought something had happened to you. \n- Nah, I was in Bali. Great place. You should go visit sometime. \n- Father, I literally barely make enough to cover rent... \n- Meh, that’s a shame. I tried to at least get you some gifts, but they wouldn’t let me pass them through customs. Such a waste. \n- Mhm, can we actually focus on the mass? We start in seven minutes. Are you even in a shape to hold it? \n- Sure. Never felt better. Let’s have at it. \n- Let me guess, you’ve had too much of the wine again, haven’t you? - An altar boy asked in disappointment after leaning in closer to the priest. \n- Can you blame me? I’m trying to give us a rebrand, and part of that includes starting our own vintage. Someone has to taste test it, after all. \n- And how is that rebrand supposed to help the church? \n- Just think of all the profits once our parishioners invest. Maybe you’ll even be able to secure that vacation if you secure yourself a cut. \n- How about actually focusing on the religious service? \n- Actually, I’ve had ideas for that as well. Do you ever notice how gloomy everyone is after leaving our church? We need to change that. People like having nice things to look at. We’ll commission some new artwork, brighten the area up, get Jesus a nicer cross, make his expression a bit happier... \n- Jesus died on that cross, Father. \n- And now it can be made of gold.

The recent construction of a premium distillery within the 'Polana Notecka' residential district has been met with uproar, with fierce protests outside the church of St. Stanislaus demanding the resignation of the bishop responsible for overseeing the construction. I have a random local parishioner here with me for comment. So, sir, what are your thoughts on the issue? \n\n- Listen, lady. I don't have a damn clue what these so-called protesters are on about. We've been lobbying for the construction of this distillery for over a decade. And now that we have it, they're suddenly upset. \n- Critics highlight that the building was placed within a heavily populated area, displacing many of the citizens with almost no compensation. \n- Heavily populated. Yeah, a slum. The place has always been a dump, at least it's no longer such a sight for sore eyes. \n- And what about those who became homeless almost overnight because of the construction \n- Okay, so what? The city desperately needed new investments. It's a necessary evil. How many did it even affect? Like 5? \n- Around 450, going by inhabitancy estimates. \n- Eh. Same thing. \n- Furthermore, many claim that what the area needs is an expansion of the near-inaccessible welfare programs rather than a factory producing something that most citizens will never be able to afford. \n- Of course, those lazy slobs are asking for yet another handout. But as they say, give a man a fish, and you only feed him for a day. We... I mean, uh... the Church is giving them new job opportunities instead. \n- Filled by external contractors recruited from outside the city. \n- Great. That means they have to move in here, then. Bolster our local workforce. \n- And did you, personally, have the privilege of sampling any of the distillery's products \n- Hah, me? I wish, but it's slightly out of my budget. \n- In that case, why were you such a strong advocate for the construction of something that neither you nor nearly anyone in the neighborhood could possibly benefit from directly, instead of an investment that would not only provide jobs but also affordable goods for the community? \n- Well, it has to do with the recognition of uhh... something about the economy... it will trickle down and umm... Krysia, what kind of question is this? You were supposed to give me softballs, not interrogate me. \n- I’m trying to make this interview at least somewhat believable.

Visitors were still far from a regular sight. \n\n- Reason for entry? - He shot up as soon as the windows rolled down. \n- We're on pilgrimage. \n-Permit? \n- What... permit? We were told we wouldn't need any. \n- Pilgrimage permits for individual visitors are handed out by parish authorities at the point of departure. Group visits are the ones that don't require any specific documents, but you will have to register beforehand. There's one leaving Ostróda in three days. You can start there. \n- But the leaflet promised... - Oliwia stuck her hand out, holding the piece of paper towards the guard's face. \n- The leaflet... oh, you're here for the 'Kuyavia, A Land of Spiritual Adventure' offer. - His tone immediately became more jovial. \n- So... we don't need the permit? \n- No, no, of course not, my friends. Everyone is welcome in 'Kuyavia, A Land of Spiritual Adventure.' But let me tell you what we've got on offer first! \n- I think we can figure it out as we go... \n- Oh, but then you'd likely miss some of our best attractions. First, you'll need this map. Don't want to get lost in 'Kuyavia, A Land of Spiritual Adventure,' after all! It has all the most important spots outlined. Did you know that the Popiełuszko Museum has recently been expanded, with two new floors, a live animatronic that allows you to speak with the martyr, and even an educational theme park nearby? There's also a full reenactment of the Way of the Cross every Tuesday, where the top donor gets to play the role of Jesus. You don't want to miss that. And of course, you need to see the new Ziggurat of Mary. All's possible in Kuy... \n- Why do you keep repeating that whole name? \n- What name? You mean 'Kuyavia, A Land of Spiritual Adventure'? \n- Mhm. \n- They pay me every time I do. We still don't get that many visitors, so right now, you're essentially providing my salary. \n- Alright, great. Glad I could help then, but can we just be on our way? \n- I'll raise the barrier for you, but don't drive off just yet! I'm sure you didn't know that 'Kuyavia, A Land of Spiritual Adventure' has an official mascot! Wait here just one second. Let me just grab my costume, and I'll sing you our anthem.

She once again checked if she really did have the right address. \n\n'Sisters of St. Elizabeth Convent and Guesthouse' \n\nWith apprehension, she walked in, both admiring and sneering at the commercialized interior, quietly shaking her head in disapproval upon seeing the symbol she held most sacred reduced to decorations. She approached the front desk, ringing the bell on the counter to make herself known. The nuns out back appeared overjoyed upon seeing one of their own. \n\n- Welcome, Sister. I hope you have enjoyed safe travels. \n- Mostly. They stopped me for a few hours at the border, but other than that, the journey had been surprisingly peaceful. \n- I am truly sorry they gave you a hard time. It seems even undisturbed peace for the pilgrims is too much to ask for nowadays. \n- I'm not even surprised. I came here from Płońsk, you see. Looks like our regions are gearing up for war. An unplanned stop and some guards rummaging through my belongings seems like a relatively good scenario. \n- Still, I will pray for your good fortune when you return. For now, though, you should have some rest. Would you like our Bishop, Cardinal, or Father Director package? \n- Anything with a bed is fine. My back will no longer let me sleep on the floor, but as long as I get a mattress, you can give me the key, and I'll be on my way. \n- I'm sorry, Sister, but the system won't let me input that. \n- Alright, just give me your most basic option then. \n- Perfect! That will be the Bishop package - a king-sized bed, unlimited access to our spa, and an à la carte selection of Sister Anastasia's finest cooking. \n- THAT is your cheapest option? \n- Yes, I know it's not much, but for only an additional 200 Złoty per night, I'll throw in our premium concierge service. \n- I can still find my own way around the city just fine. I don't need someone to take care of the work for me. \n- Okay, in that case, Sister Wiesława will take your bags to your room. If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask. \n- Just one - can you point me to where your chapel is? I need to pray for the spiritual well-being of this establishment. And yours, my Sisters. \n- Oh, umm... we don’t have one. We had to remove it during the renovations to make room for the sauna.

The two regarded one another with suspicion, pacing their steps carefully as if verifying their loyalties through some elaborate form of code. Deeming his partner to be sufficiently trustworthy, one of the vicars broke the silence. \n\n- We should be safe here. Nobody comes here during this time of day. So, any news? \n\nThe leaves rustled as the wind fell to a sudden standstill. The pair could feel a sudden chill. Though the area seemed clear, they could feel dozens of ears around them, listening in on every word. \n\n- Karol, there’s no such thing as a safe spot within the Complex. There’s always someone listening. \n- I understand your desire for secrecy, but don’t you think you’re being a bit... paranoid? I’m sure they have bigger issues than monitoring our conversations. \n- Come, let’s take a brief stroll. You see that nun praying by the hedges? If you come close enough, you’ll hear she’s only pretending. She works for Rydzyk. \n- All of us work for Rydzyk. \n- Ugh, yes, we all do, but I mean... she spies for Rydzyk. Makes sure nobody blasphemes, steps out of line... basically says anything bad about the Father Director. And that gardener working on the same patch for the past two hours, he is on Król’s payroll. Do you get the pattern now? \n- Mhm. \n- Good. Now take a look at those two altar boys skipping rocks by the pond. Who do you think they work for? \n- I don’t know, Rydzyk? Laskosz? \n- They’re mine. Don’t think I would’ve gotten all that information without a couple of extra sources. You’d be surprised by just what sorts of stuff they can overhear. \n- How do you even afford that? \n- Well, it does take a hefty portion out of my stipend. Those little bastards sure know their worth. Luckily, these ones pretty much pay for themselves. They’re agile enough to navigate some of the underground passageways. They can move supplies in and out of the complex. It’s a pretty lucrative business. Surprisingly untapped. \n- Hold on... outside? I’ve been trying to get a message out for weeks. Do you think they could deliver it to someone in the city? \n- Personal? \n- Family. I’m sure they must be worried. \n- I’m sorry my friend, but I cannot help you. It’s a strictly commercial line.

Ever since the start of the blockade, deliveries had become too risky to maintain, and though, for now, he was able to hide this fact from the rank-and-file clergy, they were rapidly running out of supplies. Rydzyk's words were clear, though. Nobody but him could give the order to reopen the gates, and now, in his delirious state, he looked increasingly unlikely to even consider giving that command... but to defy his will would constitute sacrilege. \n\nAn aide - one of the fresh-faced seminarists tasked with tending to the Father Director's every whim - walked in, visibly shaking. Tears streamed from his eyes. \n\n- Father Król, it has happened. He is in Heaven now... \n- Final... I mean... I am filled with sorrow. The world has lost a saint today.

TOR.71.t: "Envy of the Fallen"
TOR.71.desc: "Sławomir sat alone in his office, years of humiliation finally nearing an end. He yearned to reclaim his pride and influence - Father Director’s iron grip was weakening; at last, his moment for justice had come. The religious fanatics had stolen everything from him: pride, power, and the people. After Rydzyk destroyed his reputation, exile in his law firm was all that remained. For years, resistance seemed futile, as if Rydzyk’s regime would last forever. But Sławomir’s anger never faded. It may have if not for one thing: the Director was not invincible. Age had caught up with him. Patrols were fewer and less vigilant. Even the all-seeing Radio Maryja showed signs of decay. Cracks appeared, and people began to see the truth: there was nothing holy in this kleptocratic empire.\n\nSławomir Mentzen lit up his cigar, the smoke curling upward like the fire of his ambition, burning hotter than ever. His mission was clear: to dismantle the corrupt regime and restore dignity and freedom to the people. Over the years, he had built a vast network. Spies fed him information from every corner, and even a few disillusioned priests, no longer able to stomach the betrayal of their faith, had pledged loyalty to his cause. Support grew quietly but steadily. People were ready; ready to rise when the time came. With each passing day, the tide turned further in his favor. The path to victory, once unimaginable, now lies within reach.\n\nHowever, he felt no joy. Beneath the surface of momentum and rising support, a grim certainty weighed on him; people would die, many of them. They looked to him as the alternative, the symbol of change, but he was not sure he was ready. The burden of leading a nation might be more than he could carry. What if the rebellion failed? What if all the sacrifices led to nothing? Doubt gnawed at him. The future was a maze of unknowns, filled with uncertain paths and hidden dangers. And yet, he had to choose. But which path could he live with?\n\nMentzen stood up from his chair and slowly approached the window. The darkness of the night swallowed Grudziądzka Street, with only fragments touched by the pale glow of the moon. He watched the silent city of Toruń, knowing it would not remain silent for long. History never asked for permission - it demanded choices, sacrifices, and blood. Whether he was ready or not, no longer mattered. The wheels were already in motion, and dawn would come with or without him. With a steady breath, he drew the curtain shut, turned toward the door, and stepped into the shadows, where history was being written. "

TOR.73.desc: "A gray Mercedes came to a calm stop in a deserted parking lot, around decrepit communal housing buildings. Sławomir Mentzen, along with his cameraman, prepared to record footage for the new episode of 'A Day with Mentzen.' The chairman of 'New Hope' fixed his clean, as always, suit upon leaving the car, while the cameraman readied the recording, and started to gesture, counting with his fingers. \n\n- Greetings, I welcome you to another Day with Mentzen, and today's episode will be quite different than usual. - He greeted his viewers cordially. - Instead of presenting my daily routine of working in and around the politics of the region, I shall unveil the truth of how the hard-working and faithful individuals are treated under the greedy rule of Toruń's Clergy. \n\nAfter the first cut, Mentzen walks across a desolate parking lot, on which only his car is in a state better than scrap. \n\n- I've made my way to the place where I lived through my childhood years. It saddens me to see it in such condition. Just a few years ago, this was a thriving, prosperous community; one couldn't find a free space on this lot, and now? People can't even afford a bicycle, let alone a car. \n\nIn the next scene, he walks through a broken door into the interior of a tenement building. The corridor is completely covered in trash piles, and many doors have been nailed shut with planks. \n\nA friend of mine used to live in this building when we were kids. - He stepped over a pile of cans and broken glass. - I would help him with his math homework, and we would play football afterwards, and now? This place is a cockroach haven. \n\nUpon the next cut, the chairman is seen walking into a flat through a door off its hinges. Inside, an elderly woman sat upon a chair in the living room, offering a seat by the table to Sławomir. \n\n- Mrs. Bogumiła was kind enough to show us inside her apartment. It pains me to see how disrespected and poorly treated the elderly of our nation are. - He gestured for the cameraman to pan around the room. - No electricity, no hot water, springs coming out of the bed, and bread made out of so much sawdust, Mrs. Bogumiła couldn't even cut it with a knife. \n\nIn the next scene, Mentzen is seen driving his Mercedes into a gated community in the suburbs, owned by the clergy. The automated registration reader allowed his car in. \n\n - Most of you, dear viewers, may never be able to enter this area. - The camera panned from side to side, showing extremely lavish buildings. - Some of the entrepreneur clients of my chancellery used to live here; that is, before the church took ownership of these expensive villas and handed them out to priests. Now look, Maybach, Bentley, Bentley, Rolls Royce, BMW, BMW, BMW, Audi, another Maybach. - Mentzen pointed out the brands of cars standing on the driveways, more often than not in twos or threes. - This is how the clergy live, and how they put themselves above you. \n\nThe episode goes on for another two hours, in which the chairman of 'New Hope' unveils the hypocrisy of the priesthood not following Christ's example."

TOR.75.desc: "The recording opened on a shot of Sławomir Mentzen standing in front of the gates of a small church, the sun nearly at zenith, since noon had only barely passed. The camera zoomed in heavily on his dubiously photogenic face, making the backdrop not much more than a blur. In his hands, a folder of papers. \n\n- Good morning, everyone, welcome to another issue of our show. Today, I am only a stone’s throw away from Toruń, visiting our lovely countryside parishes. What a peaceful place to be, isn’t it? A true show of modesty and the good, simple life, unconstrained by any metropolitan vices. \n\nMentzen paced a few steps to the side, the shot widening to show the local priest leaving past the gates, seemingly uncomfortable when faced with the presence of such an overwhelming force. Or maybe he was just camera-shy. Either way, Mentzen approached him with a smile as the man was seemingly moments away from sitting down in his car. \n\n- Ah! I was hoping to see you today, Father Nikodem. I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about the local parish? I am simply stunned by the new ornaments adorning the gates. \n\nThe priest, unsure how to respond, murmured something akin to approval, yet far too quiet to be meaningfully audible on the lapel mic. Mentzen turned to the camera with a smile that showed just the slightest bit of smugness. He checked his papers and looked back at Nikodem. The cameraman readjusted to show an even wider picture. The church, the duo, and a quite expensive-looking car. \n\n- Oh, but where do I start? I mean, everything is just so beautiful. How about those ornaments? Beautiful handiwork, high-quality metal; probably won’t rust. I’d wager that would be something like 2000 zł, right? 2500 maybe? \n\nFather Nikodem chuckled nervously, changing his stance slightly, as if wanting to take a peek inside the papers in Mentzen’s hand. In a somewhat shaken tone, yet still oozing with the status of his position, he replied. \n\n- Why yes, you have a good eye for evaluating things, Doctor Mentzen. It was a goal for which we had been gathering for quite a while in the parish. All the donations of our wonderful churchgoers... \n\nMentzen, however, butted in in the middle of the holy man’s reply, placing a look of annoyance on his face. \n\n- I bet they’re overjoyed because of them, but I do have to ask another, more personal question. You drive a really nice car. I mean, wow. This thing has got to cost at least 100k, right? Those custom rims? I mean, get a close-up on that. \n\nThey were shiny, polished to a mirror’s sheen, shaped like Jesus on the cross, visibly custom-made and not simply plastic. When the camera panned back to the two speaking, the Father was letting slip his air of superiority as he stepped over to the car. Yet Mentzen continued. \n\n- I wasn’t finished, Father, just one last thing! These documents I have show that a considerable amount of money went to an... \n\nThe car door slammed shut. \n\n- ...an investment! Into the diversification of Parish assets! \n\nThe car sped off, out of frame. Mentzen straightened out, looked at the camera, and with a smile that looked almost as if he was about to laugh, he turned the papers to the audience and moved on to his closing remarks. \n\n- As you can see, even a small parish clearly has space for all sorts of luxuries. Who funded them? I cannot tell you that, however, for the sake of posterity, these papers I am holding will be available in the description below..."

TOR.76.desc: "With a loud thud, Bartosz slammed the doors to his studio apartment shut. He threw his bag blindly in rage, with barely any strength left in him after another soul-crushing shift at the warehouse. Day after day, he felt as though both his youth and life were being drained bit by bit. Defeated, he dropped onto the sofa and stared at the ceiling. This certainly wasn't the life he imagined back when he was still in school. Dreams of an academic career were shattered by German tanks rolling through the country, but even before that, life wasn't perfect. He left his home village to attend school in a big city, in a nation constantly flipping between EU lapdogs and conservative stooges. Ever since the collapse of the old order, he jumped from one small, soul-sapping job to another, making enough to survive and not have to run back to his family, yet far from enough to break the downward-spiraling cycle of wasting his life for minimum wage overtime. Knowing he wasn't alone in this situation, after all, he met a ton of people just like him in all the workplaces that were willing to employ him, didn't make him feel any better. Quite the opposite, the corruption and systemic oppression of the masses fueled his anger and rage. All that he and many young adults like him want is to make an honest living in a career that is satisfying and rewards hard work. \n\nHe had applied to any and all available careers he could find; unsuccessfully. Suddenly, he realised that one of the letters he sent hadn't yet been answered. On one hand, sure, it might've been ignored, like most, but even the slimiest corporation would love to smooth a denial of an application with a 'Thank you for applying, however...' With the rising influence of the clergy, he noticed an increasing number of openings in the academic seminary. Not necessarily all that religious, Bartosz thought that maybe, in the darkest of days, a divine intervention was the only hope for someone like him. He started to show up to Sunday Mass, tipped the collection plate with any leftover banknotes, and even prayed before bed. He jumped up with renewed energy and rushed his way out of his apartment and down the stairs to the postbox. Sorting through the letters, he saw bills, bills, and more bills, but one envelope stuck out, with a large wax seal upon it. He threw all the bills on the ground, and with great hope and excitement, he gently took off the seal, closed his eyes, and opened the envelope. Finally, the ticket out of this hellhole. Once and for all, he'll be done doing all the insufferable jobs and start the academic career he always wanted. He peeked, opened the folded paper, and read with a racing heart:"

TOR.77.desc: "- Wake up! Wake up! On your feet! - The sergeant's shout meant it was 5 AM. - I want to see you ready for the morning exercise in 5 minutes!\nJakub and his squadmates got to work, putting on their clothes and making their beds.\n- Fall in! - Sergeant shouted, and Jakub's squad exited their tent and formed a line. \n- To Arms! - Seven recruits shouted!\n- Look at that! You're on time today. That means no punitive push-ups. Follow me.\nThe whole squad jogged behind the sergeant for a good 2 kilometers, then did 30 push-ups and 50 squats. Even for Jakub, who had a past in athletics, this seemed a bit too much, not to mention his fellow recruits, who weren't as fit as he was.\nAfter the exercise, they gathered in the field cafeteria for breakfast, which consisted of hardtack, spam, cheese, and coffee.\n- You're still so enthusiastic about your service here, Kuba? - His colleague, Tomasz, asked.\n- As sure as I ever was - Jakub replied, much to Tomasz's surprise. It's not like he had any alternative.\nBefore he was recruited, he lived with his grandma after his parents had died in a car crash. She took good care of him, provided for him, and as a devout Christian, she tried to raise him as a good believer. Some of it stuck, mainly because she taught by example how a kind Christian should act, instead of preaching about fire and brimstone. She often listened to Radio Maryja, but wasn't one of those Mohair warriors. Things changed when Rydzyk got ill. She hysterically started to send most of her pension money to his foundation for them to find a way to treat their director... despite her own ailment.\nShe did that in secret, unbeknownst to Kuba, who was too preoccupied with school and a part-time job to realize what was going on, before it was too late. One day, he found her unconscious and called for an ambulance. After some digging, he found her unrenewed prescriptions and few packs of drugs, emptied months ago.\nWhen he visited her, he called her out on that as delicately as he could. And she revealed the truth to him.\nThe money will serve Father Tadeusz more than me - she said.\nA few days later, she died.\nJakub was partly to blame for her untimely death what was going on, but Rydzyk and his sect were to blame for manipulating an old woman, so she denied herself the needed medicine.\nAfter that, he was left alone. He neglected school and started painting hateful graffiti directed at Rydzyk. It didn't take long for him to be recruited by an Ad Arma agent, who helped him evade a police patrol.\n\nAfter breakfast, the squad readied itself for the first training with firearms. Each of the squadmates was equipped with a rifle, a training flashbang, and a massive backpack.\nThey were supposed to traverse the obstacle course that consisted of such contraptions as a mud path to crawl through, a line bridge through trees, then climbing obstacles - a wall and a net you were supposed to traverse with your body hanging. After that, each of the squadmates was supposed to throw a training flashbang through the window of the simple cardboard room and shoot at a target. After a few rounds, Tomek passed out, Łukasz broke his leg during his last course, and Piotr lost his consciousness, fortunately, after the deed was done."

I write to all you who, in the name of the freedoms set in the Confederation’s Crown, the brotherhood found under our white Eagle, and equality before almighty God upon the Cross, waged ingrate and brutal war on our march to unity.\nAs this Nation’s state of being proves, not all have learned the bitter lesson, which is often told to us. And Power, as a trap for the greedy souls, has slammed Torun into a deadly trap. Adherents of faith have forsaken their duty, and decadence has poisoned their hearts. They forgot about Virgin Mary, even as their subjects, remain in adoration of Her.\nBut a bloody tyrant has ascended their throne, and guides their devotion to him; he and his heresiarchs feast on Poland’s piety, a parasite that was once God’s servant.\nYes, Jan Król, Tadeusz Rydzyk, their Redemptorist Church, who profess to be the finest of God, Honor, and Homeland, are as ravens that gather around our beloved Nation, hungering for the feast from the dead. In place of labour for the country, they direct toil for their own paradises. In place of gathering might to thwart enemies of our national piety, they gather money and power for their own sakes. It’s one thing to rest on your laurels after victory and squander it; It’s another when laurels are their own end.\nGod’s daughters and our elders, of pristine faith, are deceived by the mean heretics. Swearing their livelihood and themselves, to protect the Church turned sour.\nBut our faith is strong, and the voice of the truth will awaken Torun from slumber. We are legion and we are everywhere in his domain, and we mourn our hand in their rise. This is all our fault. We, the Torun Confederates, who are loyal to our duty. Our penance is plain: To stand under the rightful banner again and rectify our error by taking the Church over in the name of frugality, virtue, and the Nation. And despite our sin, we dare beg you, fellow Confederates and fellow Nationalists, dedicated to God, Honor, Homeland... lend us your ears. Arms, volunteers, connections. All you can spare. All you can afford without endangering yourself. And you will still have a friend in Toruń.\nThe country will again be soaked in a bloody tide, washing away our sins and theirs. But fear not. Fire of faith burns in our chests, after all, Virgin Mary is with us. If you have nothing else, join us in words of holy prayer to cleanse the Church from decadence and lies. If you have more to spare, then rejoice: your tools will make a wrathful cry out of the righteous choir of the faithful.\nAnd once the flag of the Confederacy flies over Torun, know the name of the one guilty of bringing the nightmare to it, redeemed by defeating it. The name of hope and light in the dark."

TOR.79.desc: "It might've been just a couple of minutes since Artur entered the Sanctuary, but to him, it felt like countless hours. As nervous as he was, trying to fit among the loyalist priesthood, he was determined to see his mission to completion. He lifted the sleeve of his cassock, uncovering a counterfeit Rolex watch. He was just a minnow within the clergy, but ever since he decided to become a mole within the Church's structures, fitting in among his brothers in faith simply felt wrong. A quarter past four in the afternoon, he still had some time before the meeting with the local provost, a possible higher-up turncoat that could truly bolster the ranks of the conspiracy against the Father Director. He knelt in one of the pews within the empty nave and began to pray. On one side, he felt it was justified, going against the corrupt priests, to hold the Church as an institution to the highest standards of truthfulness and generosity, to bring all bent and greedy priests to justice. However, in the back of his mind, he couldn't help but ponder the idea that going against the will of the Church is a sin in itself. This thought often kept him up at night. It had no mercy on his psyche. The young priest found his comfort in prayer, asking for guidance, blessings and forgiveness, and hoping that the Church would truly turn away from sin and stand for the values Jesus himself preached about. \n\n- God bless you, Brother Artur. - A whispering, elderly voice surprised him. - I hope you don't mind if I join you in your prayer. \n - God bless, of course not, Father Amadeusz. I had hoped to speak with you. - He whispered back. \n- I'm aware. - The elderly priest knelt beside him in the pew. - However, here is the only place where only God will be our witness. I know what you've come here for. \n - I shall keep this brief, then. - He bowed his head down, looking to his side, scanning the hall briefly. - We believe that the Church hasn't been faithful to the teachings of our Lord and Saviour. \n- Big words considering who you stand with, brother Artur. - His wrinkled hand raised to his glasses, fixing them. - I have received the envelope from your superiors. I wasn't amused. \n- Father, I come here not as an agent, but as a fellow servant of our Lord. - He took a deep breath. - The Church is misguided under the current administration, and I believe it's also in possession of a certain artifact that would interest you. \n- Is that so? - His gray, burly eyebrows raised slightly, in a show of curtailed curiosity. - I might consider this proposition. Not for myself, of course, but for the good of my Parish. \n- God is my witness, the pinky toe of Jesus shall be displayed here, to the joy of your congregation. \n\nThe two nodded in agreement and parted ways, and as he passed the gateways, Artur hoped there would be enough holy body parts to sway all of the clergy."

Sławomir Mentzen sat at the head of the long table, flanked by his most faithful allies, among them: the man behind the scenes - Przemysław Wipler, his brother-in-crime - Tomasz Mentzen, and the regional administrator - Marcin Sypniewski. Files were stacked in neat, intimidating piles. Every page in those files, every highlighted line, was ammunition.\n- Can we begin already? - Wipler urged Mentzen to begin.\n- We're waiting for one final guest. -Mentzen replied.\nAfter 20 minutes, the circle of conspirators was enlarged by one additional schemer.\n- I didn't expect you'd turn up yourself - Tomasz Mentzen's voice betrayed perplexity.\n- Sorry, I'm late. - As a disguise, Jacek Hoga shaved his hair, trimmed his beard, and put on glasses - the security was especially tough to break through, but I wanted to be present at the planning of the ultimate demise of Father Rydzyk.\nAll of the gathered looked at Mentzen for confirmation of what they already suspected.\n- You heard him right - Mentzen continued, his voice steady but carrying a current of urgency, caused by the significance of the moment as well as concern that Hoga would steal his thunder again. - We’re not speculating anymore. We’re launching an open operation against Rydzyk.\nThe words landed like a gavel. Eyes darted to one another around the table. Some faces hardened; others betrayed a flicker of doubt.\n- At this stage - Mentzen continued - there’s no pretending we’re just probing. As long as he manages to get out of this mess, we’ve got a problem. But from now on, if he catches us, we’re not the ones who are screwed.\nThe War Room had been prepped for weeks. Screens glowed with timelines, diagrams, and names. Every link in the chain of influence had been traced and retraced. They knew which strings Rydzyk pulled, and where they might fray. A low hum from the projector filled the room as a fresh slide appeared: PHASE ONE. It was a short list, but each item was a blade. Anonymous leaks. Strategic lawsuits. Whispers seeded in just the right ears.\n- This isn’t a sprint - Mentzen reminded them. - It’s pressure, constant, surgical. We don’t break the wall; we remove the bricks one by one.\nWipler spoke up, his voice measured - If he gets wind of this too early, he’ll pull strings we can’t reach.\nMentzen stopped pacing, meeting his gaze - Then we move like smoke. No single move loud enough to be traced, but all of them together, unmistakable.\nThe conversation shifted to codenames, burner devices, and who could be trusted to move information without leaving fingerprints. Digital channels were scrubbed. Back channels were fortified. On one wall, a massive calendar loomed, red circles marking key dates. Election debates. Major religious events. Financial report deadlines. Each one is a potential moment to tighten the vice.\nBy the time the meeting adjourned, the War Room was littered with empty coffee cups and the scent of a battle already underway. No one spoke as they filed out, but every step carried the weight of what they had just set in motion. The point of no return had come and gone. Now, there was only the operation."

I wish they had given us fresh cassocks instead of these. \n\n Two of the most loyal members of the New Hope were getting ready for a swap with a few members of the clergy willing to change sides.

Two priests left the car and headed towards the structure. \n\n- God bless, gentlemen. - One of the priests said. \n - God bless. Is everything ready? - Tadeusz asked. \n- Perfect, I can see you're already dressed; IDs, keycards, everything is in the car. - The second priest reached forward to Marcin, with keys in his hand, but quickly snatched them up before he could grab them. - I assume you kept your side of the deal. \n- Of course, your holiness, a green Opel, with civilian clothing in the boot and envelopes to surpass your expectations, is waiting in the garage. - He held the keys to the car in his hand in a similar manner. \n- Be blessed. - The priest responded while swapping keys with Marcin. - And God be with you.

Marcin approached the gate and lowered the window, meeting a security guard sitting in a booth. \n\n- Papers, please. \n- God bless you. - Marcin said while handing the documents. - Here you go. \n\nThe guard looked at the handed-in IDs, then back at the two. First, he lowered his eyebrows, then lifted them back up. \n- Move along. - The officer said hesitantly while handing the IDs back. - It's recommended to update your IDs after plastic surgery. \n- Many instances like that? - Tadeusz curiously inquired.\n- If it were only you, I'd be suspicious. - He gestured forward. - Move along, please. \n\nMarcin thanked, took the IDs, rolled back the window, and started driving into the Complex, fighting an urge to punch the hell out of Tadeusz for his blabbering mouth.

Waiting there for him was a duo that he’d known for a while now, doing his delivery rounds. To him, they needed no introduction - Piotr and Marek, the latter holding a clipboard, and the former a pallet trolley. As far as he knew, Marek was most likely in the know, but Piotrek? He wasn’t sure. With a somewhat forced tone, Marian began: \n\n- Hey guys, special delivery today, bet you guys heard the memo.

Like they do with spray paints, right? \n\nMarek’s expression was one of utter disappointment, partially shielding it with the clipboard in his hands.

Robert and Łukasz, two young, undercover members of 'New Hope,' hauled a big, heavy box into the middle of the square. \n\n- Are you going to tell me what's in the box, Robert, or are you making me carry it just for the sake of it? - Łukasz complained, sweat dripping down his brow. \n- Patience, my friend, it's all a part of a bigger plan. - Robert answered. - Here, the perfect area, set it down. \n\nWith a heavy thud, the two dropped the box on the ground. Under the blade of a box cutter, the container unveiled its contents. Anti-clerical signs, megaphones, red bandanas, and a Bluetooth speaker. Łukasz tilted his head, but soon he realised what was going on. \n\n- Do I see a revolutionary spark in your eye? - Robert chuckled while taking items out of the box. \n- Let's do this. We should be able to make a ruckus with all these goodies! - He grabbed a megaphone and began shouting out stereotypical left-wing phrases. \n\nNot long after, a small gathering started to form around them, chanting the same lines as the two standing on top of the box. The slightly inebriated students vibing around the park were a perfect crowd to agitate against the government. Gatherings herded exactly like this one emerged in many large cities around the region, nearly simultaneously. Radical elements of society, previously curtailed, had finally let out their emotions, and soon, riots began as columns led by 'New Hope's' undercover agents marched through the streets, throwing trash around and vandalising windows and other public amenities. The procession proved to be the match to a massive bonfire, as the agitated masses began to snowball, venting out all their frustrations against the clergy. The herd grew, not realizing the danger they were heading towards. \n\nRunning sirens and lights, police vans began to deploy, attempting to bring peace to the situation through any means necessary. The presence of law enforcement cordons and battalions of parish militias further antagonised the crowd, as the two forces began to clash, first with stones, then rubber bullets, and eventually, live ammunition. Away from the warzone, Robert and Łukasz sat in a bush, hidden, observing the fruits of their labor. \n\n- You think we overdid it? - Łukasz asked with somewhat mixed feelings. \n- Nah mate, that's exactly what we were meant to do. - Robert chuckled, observing the unfolding chaos. - Well, maybe just a bit."

TOR.87.t: "Morto Prematuramente"
TOR.87.desc: "-I know what being alive means, quit being a wise guy, Czarek! Not when your error puts me in peril! - Priest Józef Nikodemski raised his voice, which was unusual for him - I apologize, it's no look, it's also my fault. I've got to go.\nThe alarm phone from Cezary couldn't help him in his current situation, as hysterical masses of elderly women gathered around Toruń's Radio Maryja Broadcast Station, ready to lynch him for spreading lies.\nWhat he said during the call was true. While it was Czarek's duty to send the letter after ensuring that Father Director had passed away, Piotr could've verified the information and stopped this madness instead of adding fuel to the fire.\nHowever, he wanted to be the first to cover such a hot topic, before any other lesser-known radio station or newspaper did so. And now he had to pay the price.\nA Bible quote adequate to the situation would've crossed his mind if the brick hadn't broken the window in his office on the second floor, forcing him to focus on the brutish reality.\nThe crowd of pensioners was strengthened by the influx of younger men, stronger than their older alliance, but just as fierce.\n- Where is Father Tadeusz?! Death to liars! Death to false prophets!- The choir of seniors sang in repeat as the young bulls focused on destroying the environment and throwing rubbish at the police, who had just begun to try to contain the upheaval ineffectually.\n- Dear faithful, let me explain! - He shouted through the broken window.\nJust as the policemen's forceful attempts failed, so too did the priest's diplomatic approach, as a can hit him in the shoulder, finishing his address prematurely.\nEmotions reached their climax when one of the mohair rebels was picked up by the crowd. She carried an original of the unfortunate letter and a complementary, specially decorated rosary commissioned by Rydzyk as a memento after his death. This worked as a banner for the newly formed army. Wailings of women turned incomprehensible. The men finally decide to break through the windows on the first floor, forcing themselves into the building.\nPiotr's heart skipped a beat as the rioters were breaking through the following doors.\nHe started praying.\nA few seconds later, they finally reached the room where he was hiding. Their eyes burned furiously with bloodlust.\nThen a miracle happened.\n-My family... - the faint voice of a sickly old man sounded from all street speakers and radios.\nThis was enough to cause the crowd to stop for a moment.\n- I understand you are upset, but violence is never the answer... Only prayer and forgiveness. - Now everyone was sure. The voice of Father Tadeusz spoke to them.\nThe rioters were confused. They were unsure whether that was the actual voice of Father Director. For many older members of the gathering, it was too much. Many of them fainted, and that partially put out the fire, as the robust aggressors started doing CPR on them and taking them to the fresh air. Others listened to the truth of the call, whether it really came from Rydzyk or not.\n- To the Sanctuary! - Someone yelled as they exited the Radio Maryja Heaquaters and surrounding areas."

TOR.88.t: "The Brakeman"
TOR.88.desc: "Jan Król waited anxiously for the doctors to finish their daily evaluation. Out of respect for his suffering mentor, he refused to enter the chamber Rydzyk decided to spend his final days in, but he could feel the atmosphere of death and decay even from outside. It’s been weeks since the Father Director mustered the strength to leave it for even a few brief moments. Król knew that each day, he could receive the fateful news. He tried to be prepared, but the thought still filled him with dread. \n\nFather Laskosz, the aide designated as the middleman between the worlds of the living and the dying, emerged solemnly out of the room, lost in prayer. \n\n- What’s the situation? - Król asked impatiently. \n- Miserable, as ever. The Father Director remains mostly comatose, opening his eyes for no more than an hour or two at a time. Even during those periods, he’s completely bedridden. \n- Is there anything we can do? \n- I doubt it. Despite thousands of prayers for his intention, the doctors remain unwavering in their diagnosis. They give him a few weeks, nothing more. \n- So all that remains is to wait. The prospect really doesn't fill me with too much hope. \n- Me neither, but in Rydzyk's absence, we still need to keep everything going. \n- About that... you received my latest set of decrees, right? As far as I know, the majority still hasn't been implemented. Do you have any reason for that? \n- Unfortunately, I have to inform you that they have been... blocked. \n- Blocked?! By whom?! - Father Król fell into a fury, enraged that someone would question his authority. \n- By Rydzyk. Apparently, he was pretty fierce in his condemnation of the changes you proposed. \n- How!? He's only awake for like an hour per day! I specifically make sure nobody we don't want gets to see him! \n- It seems he has certain... back channels through which he issues his commands. \n- And you STILL haven't been able to find them? On someone who, as I evidently need to remind you, is literally unable to get out of his bed!? \n- It's a... complicated issue. As much as we'd like, we cannot shut him out completely. \n- Honestly, at this point, for all the respect I have for him and his work, I'm just waiting for the day he's gone. \n- Janek, you can't say something like that. You know how much we owe him. \n- Yes, and now he has become a burden. If I have to choose between Rydzyk and the Church, may Mary forgive me, I will pick the latter."
