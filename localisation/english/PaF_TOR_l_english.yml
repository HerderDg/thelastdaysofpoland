TOR_retaking_our_voice_desc: "Dear listeners! Even if our success at restoring order to Toruń has been tremendous, there is still one final frontier, one more fortress we must burst apart the walls of, like Joshua at Jericho! What once used to be our main broadcasting center is now corrupted and twisted by Judeo-Bolshevik sin! The workers there now busy themselves with undermining the Christian truth, with destroying what is holy and good within the world! This will not stand, my brothers and sisters! It is time to retake what is truly ours, to reclaim our Promised Land from the pagan menace! Let us then pray for the soldiers who shall preform this great deed... We fly to Thy protection, O Holy Mother of God..."

Her former throne may lay fractured in Poland's demise, but that will never mean she will cease to be our great patron. She gave birth to our saviour, gracefully accepting God's gift upon her and leading to the salvation of the whole Earth with it. Why this specific day? Well, such is because of a proclamation by Blessed Father Rydzyk: that Virgin Mary shall be our nation's great patron on the road to the rallying of all Polish christians under our banner. I urge all of you to celebrate this great occasion the best you can."

TOR_burden_of_our_sins_desc: "As God speaks through the Book of Amos: 'For I know your many crimes and the enormity of your sins!' \nKnow this: the burden of your sins truly grieves and afflicts our Lord. No transgression ever escapes the eye of God — therefore, pray for forgiveness. \nChristian brethren! Not all is lost! \nThe foundation of faith is repentance for unworthy deeds.Yet when a holy priest humbly asks for a small offering in service of our community, you turn your backs. You forget the priests, you spit in their faces, and still they pray for you — asking only for a token of alms. \nRepent, while there is still time! \nOtherwise, the tears of Jesus shall overflow the cup of bitterness, and once more it shall be poured out upon the world—washing away iniquity, and with it, the defiant."
TOR_even_the_holy_desc: "Praised be Jesus Christ!\n Dear Christian brothers, do not forget the sacred role of our priests in their service to God. Consecrated through the holy sacrament, they are exalted in the eyes of the one and only Creator. It is the best among us—the most devout—who enter the priesthood. I assure you, they are humble, diligent, and pure in conscience, with the sole purpose of serving God.\n Yet, humans tainted by original sin—this includes even the clergy—may at times fall into corruption. To quote the Blessed Father Director: 'Yes, the priest has sinned—he has. But who has no temptations?'—thus defending the unjustly accused martyr, Bishop Edward Janiak. Show understanding for moments of weakness—for they remain nearly invisible within the stream of goodness that your priests, almost always, share with you."
TOR_gone_for_a_price_desc: "But believe me, listeners, not all hope is lost! As we know, God is gracious, and he will forgive us our sins! However, relief from the greatest of sins is not to be found within the, often difficult and strange, world of the confessional. Instead, we have devised a new idea: mass where, just by your very presence at such, your sins will be forgiven! Entry is paid, but we should consider paying that tithe an act of self-sacrifice and worship. The funds only go to good causes, after all."
TOR_pardon_disgraced_desc: "Praised be the Most Holy Virgin Mary!\n 'Let he who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone', says Jesus Christ to us. Devout brothers, take this teaching straight into your hearts, for it has been given to us for our salvation. Remember! Before you judge your neighbor, first examine your own conscience. Do not hurl words of hatred when a priest strays upon his spiritual path—for to err is human.\n As the Bible again reminds us: 'The Lord examines both the righteous and the wicked; His soul hates the one who loves violence.' Therefore, do not spread hatred, for that is not the path of a good Christian. True mercy is shown by the one who supports our Blessed Father Director and, when the time comes—by the words of Christ—forgives sins not seven, but seventy-seven times."

TOR_spread_the_virtue_desc: "Our current situation seems dire. We receive many calls from distressed faithful about hardship and straying away from Christian ways. This is not the first time good Christians have suffered such a fate. We remember the totalitarian persecution of the 20th century. In those daring times, seek comfort in the story of venerable Father - Tadeusz Rydzyk's life. The pagan nazi Germans killed his mother's husband, Franciszek Rydzyk, who just like Saint Joseph protected his spouse and her son. Unlike the Son of Man, Father Taduesz was denied the chance to meet the man his mother loved.\nYet he persevered, still full of faith. He survived the cruelty of the Second World War and the bloody atheistic regime of communists, who couldn't stop him from spreading the Word of Christ. Emulate his stance and together with the Family of Radio Maryja, you will be able to weather the storm that came after the Fall."
TOR_castitas_desc: "Praised be Jesus Christ and ever Virgin Mary. Today we have a very special guest. Today we'll hear the live words of Father Tadeusz Rydzyk.\n\n'Those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.'\nChastity. It is perhaps the most important vow as it not only applies to monastic orders but to the whole of the clergy. It is also because for many it is the hardest one. To forsake the possibility of having offspring... How many are able to keep such a pledge. No wonder there are some priests who fall especially in the atheistic culture of promiscuity that surrounds us.\nI urge all priests who struggle with lust to remain ever stalwart. We don't want to provoke the lustful unfaithful to hypocritically attack the clerics for their minor mishaps."
TOR_mendicans_desc: "God bless all our listeners. Today's broadcast will be hosted by Father Jan Król, who'll tell us about Catholic monstic vows. Praised be Jesus Christ and ever Virgin Mary.\n\nNow and forever. Amen. 'Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.'\nWith those words, Jesus urged us to beware of the wealth that could lead us astray if we pay it too much mind. That is why, due to caution and through monumental sacrifice, monks such as Father Tadeusz shun material possessions beyond personal belongings. It is most noble example that I personally try to embrace and urge you all to imitate as well."
TOR_obedientia_desc: "In today's broadcast that is a part of our series regarding monastic vows. Today, my guest is the minister of economy - Sławomir Mentzen and the topic of our discussion is: Obedience. Minister, what does obedience mean to you?\n\nThank you for your invitation. Obedience is to me a key factor of a well-functioning society. I demand obedience from my children and similarly expect them from my workers, although in different form of course. In turn, I and all of the citizens are obedient to the legitimate authority of the state. We all should regard our superiors for their intelligence and competence. They serve as an example for us to do better. They're not unjust tyrants, who should be despised as the left would have you believe."

unification.80.desc: "At noon today, at a lavish unveiling, statues were raised in each major Kuyavian city. They all depict one man – the great warrior of the catholic faith, the Lord's chosen conqueror, the protector of Poland. Emerging victorious from the brutal struggle of the Toruń anarchy on the backs of his thoroughly devout followers, Father Rydzyk spread the pious teachings of Radio Maryja across the entire voivodeship. With a growing hoard of financial contributions from even the most destitute among the faithful, his state boasts resources most warlords could hardly dream of. From his evergrowing complex, his leadership undisputed, the aging priest now drafts plans to extend his influence to the furthest corners of the nation. Yet beyond this ascendance, keen-eyed watchers have spotted a significant change - a sickly, pale appearance and a drastic reduction of public events. If the speculations prove true, and the Father Director's days may soon near their end, will the empire he built survive without his guidance?"

unificationreg.80.t: "[GetNewspaper]Rydzyk's forces sack Poznań!"
unificationreg.80.desc: "While the Fall disconnected many from the outside world, at times setting Poland to the pre-industrial age, the radio infrastructure stands undisrupted. Today, all stations within Greater Kuyavia transmitted a single message in unison - one that spoke of God's glory and His triumph over the region's heathen warlords. Indeed, Father Rydzyk's forces crushed their regional opposition, vastly increasing the priest's power, but more importantly – wealth. Following Poznan's fall, the city was heavily looted, with everything of value hauled back to the cleric's ever-growing complex, yet even this wouldn't prevent another fund-raising drive from among Toruń's vulnerable faithful, as Rydzyk seems intent to milk them of all remaining worldly possessions. And though outside his immediate zone of control the priest's influence remains limited, the state's rhetoric and service not to the ideals of God, but rather Mammon, has already sown the seed of schism, with the Vatican authorities following further developments with bated breath."

unificationsupreg.80.desc: "The vision of a clergy-ruled Poland looms ever closer, as following successful campaigns to both the north and south of his Kuyavian heartlands, Tadeusz Rydzyk stands at the cusp of extending his realm over the entire country. Much to the chagrin of external observers and mainstream Church authorities alike, the priest's control continues to grow off the backs of his supporters' contributions, with the army of faithful crusaders, supposedly blessed by the heavens and funded by the cleric's vast hoards of wealth, growing to rival even those of some EU nations. As Rydzyk's influence increases, so too do his expressions of decadence, as reports indicate that his Toruń headquarters have since been turned into a den of greed and depravity. Yet with these actions deeply hidden from the public, Western Poland's false messiah prepares for the final showdown for the soul of the country."

super.80.t: "[GetNewspaper]Birth of a new covenant!"
super.80.desc: "After a decade of conflict, Poland at last finds itself whole, unified by the same man who once influenced it from the shadows. While Father Rydzyk's state portrays itself as a theocracy, it would be a misnomer to refer to it as such, as the government operates far more akin to a megacorporation, paying lip service to religious values, while in truth it serves as little more than a money funnel for its founder and patron. With the nation under his thumb, Rydzyk can finally sit back and reap the benefits of his victory, enjoying all of life's carnal pleasures, surrounded by splendor fit only for someone of his grand stature. Yet as he grows increasingly more infirm with age, it appears that the priest's time on earth is rapidly drawing to a close. Soon, he shall be judged in front of his creator, and no amount of wealth, nor the carefully maintained illusion of faith, will be enough to save him then."

unification.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Kujawja Academic Corporation unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.150.desc: "The guard has changed in Toruń, as the church rules no more. Following shocking and disgusting revelations of Rydzyk's debauchery, his support dwindled and a formerly-allied faction overthrew him. Sławomir Mentzen, leader of one of the four main branches of the Confederation and official successor to the controversial Janusz Korwin-Mikke refused to rest on his laurels and took the already significant forces of Toruń on a grand campaign, culminating in the total conquest of the voivodeship. A staunch believer in free-market policies, Mentzen aims to foster a new culture of business and entrepreneurship in Kuyavia. While his critics point to increasing exploitation of the populace by the empowered companies, the leader tosses those worries aside in pursuit of economic growth. With the war-torn region already suffering from high rates of poverty, it remains to be seen whether Mentzen's plan will be just what's needed to put it back on its' feet."
unification.150.a: "The suffering of many, the prosperity of the few"

unificationreg.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Mentzen's forces conquer Poznań"
unificationreg.150.desc: "Though the Polish state remains shattered, the nation's defiant spirit once more proves itself true, as the various warlords continue on the long path towards reunification despite all the difficulties thrown against them. A major step towards this goal has recently occurred in Kuyavia, as Sławomir Mentzen's corporate forces return to Toruń in glory following the conquest of Poznań. It appears the state's unquestioned trust in the free market has borne fruit, with the unchecked expansion of private enterprise bringing forth an economic boom – one greatly celebrated by the government's ever-swelling group of entrepreneurial supporters. Yet, beneath the façade of prosperity, reports indicate a spike in income inequality so severe, it risks rendering the majority of the population fully servile to the capitalist caste, especially as the state turns as far away as possible from the principles of modern governance, instead structuring the government far more akin to a corporate board of directors."

unificationsupreg.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Western Poland in the Conglomerate's grasp"
unificationsupreg.150.desc: "It seems money truly does rule this world, as through the power of ruthless capitalism, Mentzen's corporate state has exploited its way to holding half of Poland, all while miraculously growing its legitimacy, economy, and most importantly for the shareholders' demands, exponentially increasing its stock value. Following the conglomerate's CEO's heavy pro-business leanings, the nation is being actively reshaped, with the Fall serving as the world's greatest testing grounds for the trickle-down economic theory, enabling a state built upon a single motto: progress and profit at all costs. And though initially, this approach has done wonders for the statelet's industrial capability, it turns out even freedom is a paid commodity – one that the largest businesses are already buying out for themselves. As the little man's liberty is being progressively curtailed by corporate might, Mentzen happily sits back and enjoys the benefits of their greed."

super.150.t: "[GetNewspaper]Acquisition of Poland complete"
super.150.desc: "Despite nationwide resistance and desperate defense by the remaining warlord factions, Poland has been reborn – unified by a ruthless Conglomerate, one that puts the profits of its shareholders above the population's wellbeing. And yet, every single concern about the state's governance – the worker's rights abuses, the alleged war crimes committed in the struggle for reunification, and the replacement of democratic institutions by an all-powerful business council, has been wiped away by a revelation so shocking, so unfathomable, that it shatters the very concept of reality. It appears somehow, the country's leader - Sławomir Mentzen, has been replaced by a seemingly sentient form of artificial intelligence – an android. Though theories about the technology's significance and the identity of those behind it multiply, the truth remains shrouded from the common folk, known only to the Conglomerate's utmost elite. One thing remains certain, however. The meaning of humanity has changed, and so has life, at least for the chosen few."

#unification.151.t: "[GetNewspaper]Shooters' Brigade 1909 unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
#unification.151.desc: "The revealing of Rydzyk's transgressions against the laws of both God and Man was a grave shock for the people of Toruń. Almost immediately, schemes began to form, aiming to depose him once and for all. Disaffected and disgusted by the Father Director's true character, paramilitaries of the 1909 Shooters' Brigade under Adam Ślusarski were the first to act, as a bloody coup and repressions against Rydzyk's clique followed. Since then, Toruń has been transformed into a true military machine, churning out guns and equipment for the army. Thanks to those preparations, the warlord quickly gained the upper hand in the wars of regional unification, as city after city fell under their onslaught. Mandatory conscription has been issued for all eligible citizens as the army fills its ranks in preparation for another conquest."
