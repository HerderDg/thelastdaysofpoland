marxism_cranism_subtype_desc:0 "Drawing on the teachings of the 19th-century philosopher Karl Marx, Marxists seek to overthrow capitalism and build a classless, stateless and moneyless society by introducing a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat. Moreover, Polish Marxists also refer to the heritage of the Polish People's Republic and the Polish United Workers' Party. Polish Marxism also seeks to liberate Poland from what the Marxists call the imperialist yoke of the European Union and its Commissariats."
squattism_subtype_desc:0 "Seeing in capitalism exploitation and injustice, and in Marxist communism only the road to tyranny, squattists seek to bring about an equal, tolerant, and moneyless society through grassroots human organization and organic insurrection. Squattists also place great emphasis on ecology, feminism, LGBT rights, and animal rights. Squattists have mixed feelings about the European Union, seeing it as the anti-freedom state juggernaut it has become, but also benefiting from the support of Europe's left-wing societies "
socialdemocrature_subtype_desc:0 "Seeking a compromise between socialist postulates and liberal democracy and capitalism, Polish Social Democrats support a strong welfare state and wealth redistribution through social programs, while preserving the market economy. Although the majority of social democrats in Poland promote progressive values in their worldview, there are also more moderate or conservative branches of social democracy. "
euroliberalism_subtype_desc:0 "The crisis of the Polish state also turned out to be a crisis of liberal thought in its territories. Liberals' support for the military intervention of the European Union in western provinces translated into an almost nationwide rejection of liberalism in the territories of former Poland. The few liberals who adhered to their ideals carry on their banners the ideals of moderation and reconciliation, as well as the reconstruction of liberal democracy in Poland following a truly European model "
freemarketism_subtype_desc:0 "The roots of libertarian ideology in Poland go back to the 90s and the political activities of Janusz Korwin-Mikke. This ideology, considered a niche, in recent years has begun to gain popularity among the middle class in large cities of former Poland. While libertarians do not have a consistent ideological line, they share a love of the "minimum state" and a laissez-faire free market. "
paternal_conservatism_subtype_desc:0 "The supporters of the conservative ideology, who were largely responsible for the crisis and collapse of the Polish state in the 1920s, mostly turned to more radical parts of their idea. Those few who remained in Christian Democratic and Social Conservative positions largely continue their support for the pre-collapse of the United Right's program, as well as for armed resistance to European intervention in the West. "
autocracy_subtype_desc:0 "Those who had lost faith in the rule of the people turned to what was left for them - the rule of strength. Despotic governments, usually devoid of all ideology, rely almost entirely on the strength of the dictator and his entourage - be it the remnants of the army, police, or militants gathered towards a charismatic leader. Despots disregard the will of the people, either within or outside of their borders, and many of them have completely lost their moral compass in the heat of war. "
reactionary_subtype_desc:0 "Nostalgia is a powerful weapon. The longing for the good old days has made people more than once engaged in radical ideologies. The reactionaries in Poland, calling for the restoration of the old order, no longer mean the state of affairs from several dozen years ago. Claims that one should go back even further, centuries and even back to the original forms of regimes, are becoming more and more popular. Even if they do not come from Polish or Western culture. "
corporativism_subtype_desc:0 "Despite the fact that the central economy of Poland has fallen into disarray, there are still companies throughout the country that, despite the economic decline, function and try to adhere to the principle of business as usual. The largest of them even have the power and capital to self-rule a given territory, and the nature of the hierarchy of late state capitalism makes them closer to the feudal model than to modern society. "
postpolonism_subtype_desc:0 "The belief in the collapse of the existing societies spreading in the 21st century, combined with the actual collapse of everything that was once called Poland, changed some people, some ideas. Post-Polonism, a term coined by foreign journalists to describe the greatest of ideological excesses that grew out of the troupe of old Poland. It is difficult to define the actual "post-polonists" in Poland, but it is common to describe groups living in the conviction that the idea of Poland as a state and Poles of a nation so far has lost its basis for existence. Therefore, post-polonists want to give it a new form and will not shy away from any means to remodel this part of the world in their own image and likeness. "
neonationalism_subtype_desc:0 "Hard times are moments of decline for some, but moments of glory for others. National radicals knew how to use hard times to gain glory. By demanding a strong, nationally uniform Polish state, nationalists will not hesitate to use all means at their disposal to rebuild them - from ruins if necessary. Nationalist cliques are usually ruled by charismatic leaders who hold their power thanks to the strong ideological faith of their fighters. "
