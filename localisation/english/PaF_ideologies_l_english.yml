### OPISY SUBIDEOLOGII

marxism_cranism_subtype_desc: "Drawing from the teachings of the 19th-century philosopher Karl Marx, Marxists seek to overthrow capitalism and build a classless, stateless and moneyless society by introducing a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat. Moreover, Polish Marxists also refer to the heritage of the Polish People's Republic and the Polish United Workers' Party. Polish Marxism also seeks to liberate Poland from what the Marxists call the imperialist yoke of the European Union and its Commissariats."

squattism_subtype_desc: "Squattism is a vague umbrella term referring to all sorts of grassroots communities, movements and ideologies characterised by their highly devolved, non-bureaucratic and almost tribal ways of governance and living. Almost all squattists share pro-self governance, anti-statist and anti-police sentiments and seek to get rid of any governmental interference into their ways of life, but social politics-wise they range from anarchists and anarchic leftists to right-wing, nationalistic or even fascistic hoodlums who decry police forces interfering into their lives, encompassing the whole political spectrum, with self-ruling villages and communities devoid of any political leanings also falling under the term of squattism."

socialdemocrature_subtype_desc: "Seeking a compromise between socialist postulates and liberal democracy and capitalism, Polish Social Democrats support a strong welfare state and wealth redistribution through social programs, while preserving the market economy. Although the majority of social democrats in Poland promote progressive values in their worldview, there are also more moderate or conservative branches of social democracy."

euroliberalism_subtype_desc: "The crisis of the Polish state also turned out to be a crisis for liberal thought in its territories. Liberals' support for the military intervention of the European Union in western provinces translated into an almost nationwide rejection of liberalism in the territories of former Poland. The few liberals who adhered to their ideals carry on their banners the ideals of moderation and reconciliation, as well as the reconstruction of liberal democracy in Poland following a truly European model."

freemarketism_subtype_desc: "The roots of libertarian ideology in Poland go back to the 90s and the political activities of Janusz Korwin-Mikke. This ideology, considered a niche, in recent years has begun to gain popularity among the middle class in large cities of former Poland. While libertarians do not have a consistent ideological line, they share a love of the "minimum state" and a laissez-faire free market."

paternal_conservatism_subtype_desc: "The supporters of the conservative ideology, who were largely responsible for the crisis and collapse of the Polish state in the 2020s, mostly turned to more radical parts of their idea. Those few who remained in Christian Democratic and Social Conservative positions largely continue their support for the Pre-Fall of the United Right's program, as well as for armed resistance to European intervention in the West."

autocracy_subtype_desc: "Those who had lost faith in the rule of the people turned to what was left for them - the rule of strength. Despotic governments, usually devoid of all ideology, rely almost entirely on the strength of the dictator and his entourage - be it the remnants of the army, police, or militants gathered towards a charismatic leader. Despots disregard the will of the people, either within or outside of their borders, and many of them have completely lost their moral compass in the heat of war."

reactionary_subtype_desc: "Nostalgia is a powerful weapon. The longing for the good old days has made people more than once engaged in radical ideologies. The reactionaries in Poland, calling for the restoration of the old order, no longer mean the state of affairs from several dozen years ago. Claims that one should go back even further, centuries and even back to the original forms of regimes, are becoming more and more popular. Even if they do not come from Polish or Western culture."

corporativism_subtype_desc: "Despite the fact that the central economy of Poland has fallen into disarray, there are still companies throughout the country that, despite the economic decline, function and try to adhere to the principle of business as usual. The largest of them even have the power and capital to self-rule a given territory, and the nature of the hierarchy of late state capitalism makes them closer to the feudal model than to modern society."

postpolonism_subtype_desc: "The belief in the collapse of the existing societies spreading in the 21st century, combined with the actual collapse of everything that was once called Poland, changed some people, some ideas. Post-Polonism, a term coined by foreign journalists to describe the greatest of ideological excesses that grew out of the troupe of old Poland. It is difficult to define the actual "post-polonists" in Poland, but it is common to describe groups living in the conviction that the idea of Poland as a state and Poles of a nation so far has lost its basis for existence. Therefore, post-polonists want to give it a new form and will not shy away from any means to remodel this part of the world in their own image and likeness."

neonationalism_subtype_desc: "Hard times are moments of decline for some, but moments of glory for others. National radicals knew how to use hard times to gain glory. By demanding a strong, nationally uniform Polish state, nationalists will not hesitate to use all means at their disposal to rebuild them - from ruins if necessary. Nationalist cliques are usually ruled by charismatic leaders who hold their power thanks to the strong ideological faith of their fighters."

#################### PLACE HOLDERY #########################

marxism_cranism_stalinism_subtype_desc: "Historically, Stalin was the butcher whose death toll surpassed the Holocaust itself, starver of Ukraine, slave driver of Russia, subjugator of Eastern Europe. For the Polish, it takes a certain kind of mind to see him as a role model. Exactly the kind of mind to thrive in Fall. \n Stalinism is an authoritarian system even when compared to other Marxist-Leninist strains, aiming for thorough industrialization of the country at maximum pace, at all costs. Agriculture is collectivised. The system keeps going through pervasive state control and propaganda. Life under Stalinism is productive at best. At worst, imagine a boot stomping on a human face - forever."

marxism_cranism_maoism_subtype_desc: "Maoism is the ideology and methods employed by first leader of People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong. Like Stalinism, it relies on authoritarian control and propaganda, and its application left millions dead in its wake. Unlike Stalinism, it relies on peasant class for its cause of continuing revolution, rather than urban proletariat. What made sense in overwhelmingly rural (at the time) China, might not make as much sense in even post-Fall Poland: But its emphasis on close contact with the people and revolutionary zeal might just save its adherants. Even Pilsudzki knew that to want, is to get. Even so, Maoist revolutionary zeal and perpetual revolution manifests all too often as a crusade against the past itself. Should it have its way, Poland will be left with no roots nor past to lean upon: Only materialist, traumatised masses that could become world power if only there was over a billion of them."

marxism_cranism_peoples_army_subtype_desc: "Justified through Trotskyism, necessity or political reality, this is a stratocratic form of communism, where the army controls the state apparatus and its planned war economy. Like in communism, private property is all but nonexistant, but unlike in Leninism, the army replaces the vanguard party as the nexus of power. Said army can range from idealistic Marxists willing to transition to other forms of communism after their victory over capitalism, or national bolsheviks having as much use for national warfare as they have for class warfare. Life under such a system can be as regimented and repressive as under Stalinism.

marxism_cranism_clubism_subtype_desc: "Drawing from the teachings of the 19th-century philosopher Karl Marx, Marxists seek to overthrow capitalism and build a classless, stateless and moneyless society by introducing a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat. Moreover, Polish Marxists also refer to the heritage of the Polish People's Republic and the Polish United Workers' Party. Polish Marxism also seeks to liberate Poland from what the Marxists call the imperialist yoke of the European Union and its Commissariats."

squattism_raider_rule_subtype_desc: "Raider rule stands for a raider band and its chieftain if they have one, ruling a territory. Such a band is primarily motivated by plunder and communal wellbeing of its raiders, not ideological or stately trappings. Loosely organised and more impetous than disciplined, the raiders of such a regime will take what they want from any vulnerable target, whether within or without their territory. They may or may not adhere to anarchist principles for autonomy and lack of hierarchy, but their true mother is not Mother Anarchy, but Mother Earth: Which dictates that the strong take what they want, and the weak suffer as they must."

squattism_anarcho_comunism_subtype_desc: "Depending on who you ask, communism is either totalitarian form of government, or a stateless, classless society. Anarcho-communism attempts to skip the world revolution stage of communist revolution and abolish all hierarchy and class difference in its own territory. Such a state is a patchwork of communes, tribal-like, self-governed entities, in effect both in rural and urban spaces. They are tied together by mutualism, direct democracy and collaboration, with all codependencies fully voluntary. The anarchist, collectivist ethos guides every aspect of life: family, culture, technology: All is freely shared and any regulation is grassroots. Property is common and a commune typically will converge around a single workplace, whether a farm or a manufactoring or resource gathering or even service, though localized production is favored. If there is a standing army, it's a collectively bankrolled militia. Freedom is thus total and fruits of life without coercion are freely enjoyed. Even so, life in such a territory can be easy to get lost in, and many quickly learn the value of hierarchical institutions like standing judiciary."

squattism_anti_fascism_subtype_desc: "Antifascists exist to fight the fascists. They could be communists, anarchists, even social democrats like Weimar Germany's Eiserne Front used to be. So long as they bash the fash. What's the fash? Depending on specific group, regime or even band, it could be anyone to the right of German SPD, or specific reactionaries and nationalists. As with global Antifa traditions, antifascists are typically anarchic, communal and grassroots, with almost no central control that didn't come from their own initiative. Should such a statelet swell and centralize, it will typically become a minarchist paramilitary confederation of small county-wide chapters."

socialdemocrature_nordic_model_subtype_desc: "If Poland once was obsessed with catching up to the West, the Nordic model adhearants are obsessed with specifically catching up to the North, Scandinavia. In its extensive welfare states and libertarian social outlook, they see the only path worth taking. They'll utter phrases like 'for free market to be a thing you need harsh regulations' and expect everyone to get it. They'll take in refugees and assorted migrants from every corner of the globe and go out of their way to welcome them. Their prisons are hotels where you can sue for your God-given right for a 7th generation videogame console and win. It's also a surest way to raise populaces out of poverty, give it a fine, equitable education and provide the services that are first to go down during national collapse, but are fundament of advanced economy. Which in turn are funded by an advanced economy. Solving this chicken-and-egg problem will make or break Nordic Socialist Poland."

socialdemocrature_humanitarianism_subtype_desc: "Humanitarianists take Asimov's first Law of Robotics: That a robot will not harm a human, or through inaction allow a human to be harmed, and apply it to themselves. Globally. They feel it is their duty to always seek out humanitarian crises and proceed to reduce harm, and will direct all their surplus economic might to do so. Their socialist ethos assures that the people at home have secure existance, but the social emphasis will always be on the help abroad. They'll throw around money to feed the starving, usually through trusted or self-made NGOs or UN structures. This helps with networking abroad and therefore legitimacy relative other Polish statelets. Whether they're just busybodies who give a man a fish and only exasperbate problems in long run, or real heroes who teach men to fish, remains to be seen."

socialdemocrature_progressivism_subtype_desc: "Progress, is universally human concept of, at its basest logic, going from state A to state B. Politically, it is belief in change, especially social, as its own end. Wherever you are, you must progress. Advance. Said advancement is almost always interpreted as  furthering of civil rights that matter to Western left-liberal thinkers and NGOs, whether LGBT rights, queer rights, migrant rights or animal rights. They might break up and clash about priorities of said rights, despite concepts like intersectionalism (as it happened with once-darling of feminism JK Rowling), but the interpretation of progress as reduction of harm and expansion of rights remains their common goal. In post-Fall Poland, progressivists emphasise restoration of basic public services and rights while accelerating introduction of their civil rights and advancement of their favored idenitites."

euroliberalism_transisional_eurogovernment_subtype_desc: "The crisis of the Polish state also turned out to be a crisis for liberal thought in its territories. Liberals' support for the military intervention of the European Union in western provinces translated into an almost nationwide rejection of liberalism in the territories of former Poland. The few liberals who adhered to their ideals carry on their banners the ideals of moderation and reconciliation, as well as the reconstruction of liberal democracy in Poland following a truly European model."

euroliberalism_regionalism_subtype_desc: "There is a rich tradition of devolution in Polish politics. With political class reviled for corruption and elitism, the local councils were uniquely positioned to be an alternative to their greedy ways, close enough to the people to still be of the people and not part of the untrustworthy salons. Regionalists seek to lean upon the devolution form of government and create a less corrupt liberal democracy around the local governments. Dedicated to living and letting live, and hands-off liberalism, they're well-aligned with Poland's common worldview."

euroliberalism_dialogue_subtype_desc: "Do you remember kindergarten teacher telling you to always get along with your peers and not hit them? Use your words? Szymon Holownia, in a sense, never grew up past that dictat, and now made it into a serious diplomatic-political program. Dialogue's is pretty simple: War is the failure of politics and diplomacy: Always attempt to get along with your neighbors before resorting to it. If they're fossil fuel fetishists who would pump your stomach full of liquefied coal, given a chance, try getting along. If they're schizoids quite literally living in fantasy world, act whichever role they assigned to you and try along. Whether they're living in a past or a psychotic bubble fuelled by blood, always attempt the dialogue: There is common ground to be found in everyone. Even the worst warlord can be fixed. Sit down, grab a beer, talk. If all else fails, then you'll have made enough friends to have the swords it takes to negotiate through violence. Dialogue takes idealism bordering on delusion, modern international diplomacy, and turns it into some of the most high risk, high reward strategies to thrive in post-Fall Poland."

freemarketism_american_liberalism_subtype_desc: "If the global preeminance of United States of America was created by the XX Century's legacy of world wars, then its inordinate global corporate influence and wealth of the top 1% was enabled by Ronald Raegan's liberal, pro-business mindset. Raegan's legacy brought down the Berlin Wall, made small nations like Poland free, and assured America unprecedented power over global capitalism. It is no surprise that there's Poles ready to religiously follow the American model. In Polish translation, Americanism combines free-market capitalism with pro-business government stance, low taxes, lower regulations and coca-cola fountains. The military, police and social conservatism are given eminence in such a system, whereas the poor and the sick are to be neglected. Poland, like America, must be a land of opportunity, with no one holding it back, certainly not any vagrant. Even so, there is a populist undertone to American liberalism, a lip service to the little guy who works hard and mows his lawn. Should this Polish-American experiment avoid the pitfalls favoring big money over the little guy, perhaps the American dream will live in this corner of Europe, with pre-Fall population of California, pre-Fall GDP of Ohio and territory size of New Mexico."

freemarketism_anarchocapitalism_subtype_desc: "Imagine a perfect world, where the only law is non-aggression principle and the state enforcing said law does not exist. This is the anarchy at its purest: No state, no community, no taxes. With one caveat: Capitalist concepts and laws, live on, relying on enforcement by corporations that effectively become their own polities. Contract rules all in such a place. If you agreed to sell your third child to Biedronka, you better make the sale. If your breach of contract clause involves working 25 hours a day, you better come up with a time machine to make up that time. Wage slavery runs rampant and disputes by corporations over territory, resources and contract enforcement are settled on the battlefield: LPP S.A. will call the banners of Reserved, Cropp and others to secure their supply chain of cotton against the mercs hired by Cedrob S.A., hungry for poultry feed farming in place of cotton the former relies on. Luckily, if you're just a simple family surviving outside the corpos, you can always source a recreational McNuke for deterrance. Or to stick it up the neighbor who keeps violating your NAP by toremiting your psyche through flaunting his newest car. These might sound like ravings of a youtube content creator, but they're all eventualities in anarcho-capitalism. Eventually, one corpo will rise to rule them all. Hey, not every system gets to be sustainable."

korwinism_subtype_desc: "Exacting the views of Korwin past the label of Paleolibertarianism is not easy. Janusz Korwin-Mikke may have never won a public office or post other than MP, and became notorious for running parties into the ground and then switching them long after other parties stabilized. He achieved nation-wide recognition through his viral and outlandish appearances on TV, where he'd argue against any state involvement in economy or regulation. The sheer eccentrism and inflexible radicalism of his views on democracy itself, women and economy, made him practically unelectable. Despite that (or because of that), his influence on youth's worldview cannot be overstated. Even as everyone winced at his tirades about Adolf Hitler or exactitudes of matters of teen consent, there was large chunk of his message that landed with the youth. Combined with real and perceived corruption and idiocy of bureaucratic systems, it pushed the youth to embrace free market and pro-business worldview. However, their acceptance is selective, and Korwinism goes all the way. It is fully applied Paleolibertarianism, meaning the state has zero business in any matter at all other than defence and enforcement of binding contracts. The ancap memes you were warned about all dwell here: Enviornmental or labour protections are not a thing: Nobody gets to tell you you can't just sign contract for more hours a day than there are in a day. Socially, Korwinism is as confused as they get, reconciling overwhelmingly traditionalist attitude with libertarian ethos. On one hand, Korwinist adhearents will oppose abortion. On the other hand, an alternative to abortion is to sell an unwanted child: going rate on free market is like 20 000 EUR. Oh, you say 'would somebody please think of the children?' Why, there was a man who also wanted the best for Polish children. His name was Adolf Hitler! That was a real Korwin quote."

paternal_conservatism_liberal_conservatism_subtype_desc: "Combining CDU/CSU's soft social conservatism and FDP's business-first attitude, or at its strongest, Margaret Thatcher's imperial will, liberal conservatives are non-nonsense center-right politicians standing up for faith, family, flag and free market. They'll cut down progressive sentiments to size, alongside taxes and government waste if need be. Their vision is strong, lean state, with strong, well-supported families, mom-and-pop shops and small town living. As evidenced by Thatcher, they do not shy from decisions that cripple the little guy or his family, if the alternative is their economy being left behind by the global one. At their best, they assure strong turnover of families, stable political scene and perfect conditions for peace and plenty."

paternal_conservatism_christian_democracy_subtype_desc: "Christian Democracy is *the* ideology that shaped western democracies during Cold War and retianed influence all the way until the 2010s. Despite its confessional origins, it pays service to Christendom in purely civic context, and finds secular republics its natural habitat. Three things define it: Social conservatism, welfare state, big tent. They can encompass unionists and capitalists in single party, even as it can render them unfocused and undecisive. If christian democrats find themseles in an overwhelmingly progressive country, they will almost never actively push back against it. Only with enough social pressure, will they defend traditional values to a proper rightist extent."

paternal_conservatism_national_conservatism_subtype_desc: "When your place in your own country is threatened from without, whether by barbarians at the gates, called refugees by leftists, or Mordor-like Russian horde, called 'valued energy partners' by Germans, or the EU in its glass Babel tower, national conservatism calls to defend what's yours. Its detractors place the blame for the Fall solely at the feet of PiS, its principal champion. Its supporters view it as the only path worth taking to continuously save and advance the nation. Poland first: That's its simple motto. It operates around and well within democratic systems. It is represented abroad as wellspring from which the new European and arguably American right sprung, championed by Giorgia Meloni in Italy, Nigel Farage in UK and Marine Le Pen in France. As such, national conservatism can count on connections abroad and pragmatism that distincts it from genuine right-radicals. It will readily use culture wars to rally its base, and defend traditional values with all fervor of a radical and all the cunning of a career politician."

paternal_conservatism_kaczynskism_subtype_desc: "Jaroslaw Kaczyński was and is one of the key architect of pre-fall Poland, and inadvertebly the Fall itself. He was once one of many career politicians at the conservative wing of the nation's affairs, alongside his brother Lech. Through ruthless cunning and power plays, they both became polarizing figures that were easy to hate and found it even easier to project power. Come 2007, Lech made president and Jaroslaw made prime minister. Unfortunately, the former would die in a plane crash, and the latter would find his unpopularity bite back as he got unseated from the office. From there on out, Jaroslaw would never hold a public office, other than chairman of Law & Justice party. From there, he crafted a power web that ensured he'd never have to hold any to run the country. His party won elections all the way until the Fall. Kaczyńskism is no more or less than his thought and way of governing. The elected officials aren't strongmen: Instead, they take marching orders from the party chair, a grey eminence ruling through power and politics. Kaczyńskism essentially attempts to shoehorn single-party structure into a democratic context, using informal influence to obfuscate the political process and bring about a hybrid regime with democratic trappings. The ruthless pragmatism in power plays is juxtaposed in idealism within social matters: Kaczyńskism is stubbornly conservative, thriving on using the other side  of culture wars to rally its base. The Fall itself is proof of its extreme success: Such was Kaczyński's power, that the entire state died with him."

autocracy_national_oligarchy_subtype_desc: "Once led by God, Honor and Fatherland, National Oligarchy seeks to realign to Money, Power and Fatherland. Culled middle class, slavish lower class and ascendant upper class, bathed in inordinate wealth, are a hallmark of national oligarchy. The system is simple: The cabal of the richest and mightiest rules with iron fist, disregarding the nation itself. The 99% can expect to toil and extract resources for the sake of the 1%, wealthy beyond measure on their backs. The people have thus nothing to lose but their chains..."

autocracy_military_junta_subtype_desc: "Those who had lost faith in the rule of the people turned to what was left for them - the rule of strength. Despotic governments, usually devoid of all ideology, rely almost entirely on the strength of the dictator and his entourage - be it the remnants of the army, police, or militants gathered towards a charismatic leader. Despots disregard the will of the people, either within or outside of their borders, and many of them have completely lost their moral compass in the heat of war."

autocracy_absolutism_subtype_desc: "Louis XIV said, 'I am the state.'. This is absolutism in a nutshell. This is the oldest form of government. This is one person giving orders and everybody else following them, and one of the most default ways of being for many warlords. Indeed, absolutist regimes are mirrors of their despot: Whether it's a general of a military unit on top of a chain of command, with disciplined force and mostly intact conscience, or a megalomaniac bandit king measuring his importance by the size of his skull throne. Should such a regime grow and stabilize, it can pave way for something different, or morph into a more modern authoritarian regime, conforming realities of mass politics."

autocracy_kleptocratic_statism_subtype_desc: "Those who had lost faith in the rule of the people turned to what was left for them - the rule of strength. Despotic governments, usually devoid of all ideology, rely almost entirely on the strength of the dictator and his entourage - be it the remnants of the army, police, or militants gathered towards a charismatic leader. Despots disregard the will of the people, either within or outside of their borders, and many of them have completely lost their moral compass in the heat of war."

autocracy_theocracy_subtype_desc: "Those who had lost faith in the rule of the people turned to what was left for them - the rule of strength. Despotic governments, usually devoid of all ideology, rely almost entirely on the strength of the dictator and his entourage - be it the remnants of the army, police, or militants gathered towards a charismatic leader. Despots disregard the will of the people, either within or outside of their borders, and many of them have completely lost their moral compass in the heat of war."

autocracy_emergency_government_subtype_desc: "In the trying times of the Fall, many local officials and aspiring legitimists turned to extraordinary measures in order to mantain the last crumbles of official authority. Ranging from well-meaning administators in times of strife to budding dictatorships forging a siege mentality, these governments will use the state appartus to its full extent to preserve the order."

neonationalism_populist_dictatorship_subtype_desc: "Ah yes, the populist dictatorship. It's a tremendous form of governing - the best! I know, I know. Ask Poland - things aren't going well out there, things aren't going well. The government, it just... poof! It's no more. Terrible, terrible. Now they have nothing to fall back on, they're eating cats and dogs! So sad. But luckily someone just came along, someone just like me, who can make tough decisions. And he makes speeches and he's rallying people, terrific! So he's making great deals, and he's bringing law and order, and he really is saving people from the radical left at CNN, the EU, Eurokomissariats, all that, just like back in World War II. It's horrible. We had a good meeting with this great leader, we'll see what happens. What a guy. He's the best in the whole world. He knows when to use strength against ANTIFA and other vagrants and bandits, and there are a lot of bandits in Poland now, it's horrible. Truly truly horrible. That's why they're so lucky to have that guy, he's just like me, you know? He's the best in the whole world, the whole world. What a wonderful group of people he's leading, always ready to bring over some law and order whenever someone says like 'uh but i don't like having my country back, i'd rather have illegal immigrants and...' But no. But he's doing a fantastic job, he's doing a terrific job, and most importantly he doesn't let anyone tell him what to do! That's the guy to Make Poland Great Again!"

neonationalism_regional_nationalism_subtype_desc: "When nation-states were just becoming a reality, there were two pillars of identity the people fell back on: Their kingdom, and their region. To this day, many nations host regionalist movements of varying self-identification with the nation. Germany has Bavaria, a model regional identity within the German nation, and some of its radical nationalists view Austria and even Low Countries much the same way. In Poland, Silesia and Kashubia are the most prominent regional identities, with Silesia having a strong industrial heritage and Kashubia being more rural and maritime. Regional nationalists view their region as the true heart of the nation, often feeling neglected or misunderstood by the central government. They seek greater autonomy or even independence for their region, believing that their unique culture and history deserve recognition and preservation."

neonationalism_national_socialism_subtype_desc: "Nobody who paid attention at Polish elementary history classes, needs an introduction to National Socialism. It is the thought and deeds of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Germany from between 1933 and 1945, a direct cause of Second World War where 50 million people perished, and of the Holocaust, an industrial-scale genocide of around six million people, primarily Jews. It views Aryans as the master race, and everyone else as expendable subhumans taking up living space that could be civilized by Aryans. To Hitler and his adhearants, none are more dangerous than the Jews, who are as talented as they are deficient. Originally, Slavs were some of the most inferior of races to Nazis, which informed brutality of occupation of Polish and other Eastern European lands. Likewise, Poland's resistance against Nazi Germany was only matched by Yugoslavia in totality, among those fully conquered. Seeing the Polish warlords, even one of them, embrace this ideology is therefore a special kind of sordid irony. Revisionism and dubious mental gymnastics around Aryanhood or ancestry of Poles are often employed to bridge the historical disdain for Slavs by Hitler."

neonationalism_national_feminism_subtype_desc: "Among nations ran by the patriarchy, Poland always maintained above-average reverance and respect for its women, especially mothers. The most patriotic among radical feminists would take this and many other clues to a conclusion that nationalism and feminism go together like a strong independent woman and cats. Thus, men might be pigs, but if they're Polish, at least they're more like wild hogs endowed with certain respect, unlike those rapist foreigners."

neonationalism_national_agrarianism_subtype_desc: "You can look for essence of Poland in the dreams of catching up to mercurial West, rendered sordid by the fate of this country and the West alike. Or in its tenacity against the many invaders seeking to stomp it out. The myths of Sarmatia. National agrarianism tells you to spare you these lofty attitudes and exalt a simple life on the field. National agrarianism is a marraige of nationalist sentiment and ever-influential farmer interest, emphasising the rural lands. The soul of the nation is in the farmers, and so is its political power. Whatever a farmer needs, a farmer gets, no longer must subsidies be fought one burned tire at a time and one tractor in Warsaw at a time."

neonationalism_national_bolshevism_subtype_desc: "Although most communists balk at nationalist sentiments, even as they use it in war against a strong foe, national bolsheviks have zero qualm about fusing ideologies whose mission statements seem opposed. Indeed, all authoritarian regimes face a similar problem statement: How to assure stability absent entrenched democracy. Before Fall, only Russia housed national bolshevik movements of note. This once niche ideology takes all the authoritarian socialist trappings, like strong state, planned economy and pervasive wealth redistribution, and coats it in nationalist mission statement. To be a citizen in such a place is to be an exalted member of a superior nation, so long as you stay in your place. To be a foreigner, is to be both class enemy and an alien: And the nation has nothing to offer you but blood, sweat and tears."

neonationalism_national_catholicism_subtype_desc: "Catholicism is Poland's firmest pillar, proving essential in retaining and cultivating national identity whenever Poland was occupied by its rivals. Any nationalist, secular or not, has to acknowledge the Church as essential to Polish identity. National Catholics go a step further, and make it a cornerstone of governance too. Nothing can be achieved without it. Nothing can be promoted that goes against it. God, Honor, Fatherland are all that matter. Liberalism infringes on Fatherland, Secularism infringes on God, and liberal lifestyles are antithesis of Honor. By far the greatest challenge to National Catholics is balancing the state's influence over priesthood (and of course vice versa) with the Papacy that might not be enthusiastic about homages of what many would call clerical fascists. They'll either have to play down and justify their more extreme policies by circumstance, dominate the clergy like modern Ghibellines (or Ustase if you're really unlucky), or carefully mellow down their ideals."

neonationalism_hooliganism_subtype_desc: "Some might say that loving your football club that might not even play post-Fall, beating up the rivals of said club and holding patriotic rallies, benders or raids, isn't an ideology but a behavior of a soccer brigand. That does not stop many English football fans for adopting such lifestyle. And in context of post-Fall Poland... it might as well be an ideology. Don't expect high-minded pamphlets from nationalist hooligans. Their creed is simple: Love me club, love Poland, hate rivals, hate foreigners. Don't like it? You can talk to complaints department. That's the baseball bat, by the way."

reactionary_traditional_monarchism_subtype_desc: "Democracy, to traditional monarchists, is not the God that failed per se: It's a Satan that quite succesfully abolished a score of monarchies that derived their power from the most righful source of all: The Grace of God. To attack the monarch ruling by that Grace, let alone the institution of divine right, is to raise fist against God himself, and there is not one cause, whether welfare or progress or justice in human terms, that can EVER justify it. God wills that there must be a king and his subjects, rather than democracies and their citizens. To traditional monarchists, that is purpose and reason enough, God damn the fallout. Historically, Poland was wiped off the map by three monarchies, each ruling by divine right. But all three have lost their ways later, and were conquered by liberal world order in one way or the other. What better nation to restore the Godly monarchy, than the one three monarchies have conquered? Should the adhearants of traditional monarchism secure Poland, God will prove to have a sense of humor indeed. \n Traditional monarchists see zero use for ideals or social institutions derived from the Enlightenment. Their purpose is to transcend the notions of citizenship and nationhood, and in their place set up a subjecthood loyal to the King and His aristocrats. As is Polish tradition, there may be laws or agreements constraining the King, but liberal rule of law, women's rights or separation of church and state are all devil's works. The King is above all that, for his throne is God-given."

reactionary_medievalism_subtype_desc: "You know what really were the days? When beer was the healthy choice of drink, especially when your well smelled funny. When peasantry had over 1/4th days of year off work, so long as the quota for the Lord and the Church were met. When warfare was one of precious few means of social mobility. Life was rural, high-trust and all it took for happiness was a wife, bundle of kids old enough to work the fields, knowledge you were tough enough to survive without modern medicine and a Church mass for every sunday. This is the vision of medievalism, stopping at nothing to bring back the time as authentically as possible, or failing that, as romantically as possible. Unlike primitivists, they won't shy away from industrial technology, but will get highly creative in order to transpose modern advancements into genuinely medieval society."

reactionary_sarmatism_subtype_desc: "Sarmatism, now and forever, lends its ears to the tale of the supposed ancestors of the Poles: Sarmatians, ancient Iranian nomads who dwelled in Eurasian steppe. Back during Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Polish gentry believed itself to have originated from Sarmatians, and Sarmatism perpetuates that belief, promoting cavalier, rural lifestyle, where a horse is as essential as a smartphone today, and only dogs go on without one. Overwhelmingly traditionalist, it will designate the years of Golden Liberty as the only truly golden age of Poland, and the only time worth emulating, modern developments be damned. If it has its way, Poland will not only be stuck in the past, but embody a vision based on 19th century books depicting Golden Liberty 'for uplifting of hearts', effectively creating a new, romanticised life. Whatever we lose out in modernity, it matters nothing: God is with us, eagle above us. Even hidden we set out, and be certain we won't die."

reactionary_sanation_subtype_desc: "Seeing corruption and radicalism fester in political system can make anyone's blood boil. The injustices and cruelties radicals and criminals can bring about are many, but the worst of all is loss of potencial of the nation. Sanation, as it did in 1925, has no more faith in democratic process and seeks to put a stop to extremists before it's too late. It proposes an authoritarian regime purging those it deems undesirable away from power, historically left and right extremists, and bring about stability and quiet in political scene instead. Unlike many reactionaries it is a big tent movement for both center left and center right. Despite its stated purpose, it is not a transitional government seeking to reset democracy, but its own autohritarian system here to stay."

reactionary_paganism_subtype_desc: "Nostalgia is a powerful weapon. The longing for the good old days has made people more than once engaged in radical ideologies. The reactionaries in Poland, calling for the restoration of the old order, no longer mean the state of affairs from several dozen years ago. Claims that one should go back even further, centuries and even back to the original forms of regimes, are becoming more and more popular. Even if they do not come from Polish or Western culture."

reactionary_militarism_subtype_desc: "The Kingdom of Prussia, 200 years ago, was an army with a state tacked on to it. Reactionary militarists look at Prussia of that time, which would go on to unify Germany into a world-altering power, for better or worse, conclude that the same prospects can open up for Poland if it adapts such a system. Not only harkening back to the good old days culturally for the inner strength to be found in them, this ideology pushes for complete militarization of all aspects of life, reforming and subordinating all civilian systems and services to the military. Surrounded by hostile powers and with no geographic barriers, they argue, Poland has no choice but to make every woman and man, and every child, a soldier. Any modern military will do well to beware such a regime: Regardless of military advancements, manpower and fanaticism can never be underestimated, like many have in Afghanistan or Vietnam: And God help you if they secure a great power as a patron.

postpolonism_pol_potism_subtype_desc: "Pol Pot was a Cambodian revolutionary whose best known for anti-intellectual purges of his own people, through methods barbaric enough to make even communist hardliners abroad wince (just kidding, Mao Zedong propped them up so hard he was pretty much in on it), and fellow revolutionaries of Vietnam to invade and oust his Khmer Rouge from power. Apparently, there is a soul in Poland, so broken and malicious, that designs a repeat of such a genocide in Poland. Pol Potism takes Maoism's revolutionary zeal and its Cultural Revolution, and filters out whichsoever regard for human life is left, until all that's left is a quarter of the nation rotting alive under back-breaking labour, and for no purpose but that the Maoist peasantry might be free from any and all revisionist intellect.

postpolonism_rastarafianism_subtype_desc: "Most postpolonist ideologies are lacking to significant degrees in humanity and sanity alike, but Rastafarianism has the advantage of not being a millenarian movement sparked by the Fall. Originated among Jamaican slaves, Rastafari are an Abrahamic religious movement with strong African influence. Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia, is seen by them as Second coming of Christ. God (Jah) to them is immanent in all persons, meaning there is Divine presence and essence within everyone, motivating their pacifism. They emphasise Ital food, with diets ranging to strict vegan to simply various abstinences, and most famously, marijuana. Reggae beats, weed smoke and laid-back attitude makes them culturally attractive, and wholesome relative most other regimes."

postpolonism_posthumanism_subtype_desc: "As far as post-humanism is concerned, not only the nation of Poland must be relegated to the past, but the very humanity upon which it rests must go as well. This ideology supports dehumanization of the peoples of the world in the most literal sense possible, considering human nature to be either a weakness that's no longer tolerable, or a vicious cruelty and apathy generator whose sins have weighed the conscience of the globe quite long enough. At best, they're more guided by an utopian vision of life with perfectly designed essence of self, more transhuman than posthuman. The methods to achieve the abandonment of humanity vary per specific regime in scientific feasibility and sanity, whether the ascention they seek is spiritual, cybernetic or biological."
