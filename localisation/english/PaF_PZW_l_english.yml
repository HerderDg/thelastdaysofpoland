unification.96.t: "[GetNewspaper]Polish Angling Association unifies Warmia-Masuria!"
unification.96.desc: "It appears that PZW wasn't satisfied with only stealing from the most saintly symbols of Polish virtue called independent fishermen, so they stole the entire Voivodeship of Warmia-Masuria to use as a jumping point in their maniacal quest to rob every last Polish and soon Baltic fisherman of their hard-earned money and respect. \n\nMillions cried out in anguish as the tyrants of the Polish Angling Association came out on top in the Warmian power struggle and secured their holdings over every last body of water in the northeast. \n\nWhile most statelets of the rapidly fading Polish anarchy have voiced their discontent and swore to protect the average fisherman from the organization's greed, there are some tyrannical warlords who plan to cooperate with the Association as a measure to reap the financial benefits from exploiting their rivers."
unification.96.a: "Hide your fishing rods."
