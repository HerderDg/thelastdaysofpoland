unification.28.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Ruda Śląska unifies Upper Silesia!"
unification.28.desc:0 "In Upper Silesia, as in a song, hanys fought with gorols all day long. Saint Barbara blessed her black hosts from the heavens, making it the miners who would decide the fate of Silesia directly. In all cities of the metropolis, feverish preparations for the biggest St. Barbara's Day parade the mining world has ever seen have begun. They would go from Gliwice to Katowice, and their orchestra will be heard by every inhabitant of proud Silesia. At their head - the First Foreman, Hubert Dworniok. The popular Bercik, as he is called by his countrymen, has never been so pleased with his cunning plan, which this time surprisingly turned out exceedingly well. Or maybe he didn't plan it at all? One way or the other, Hanys Boss is now the mining king of all Upper Silesia. And he definitely has a craving for the entire region. The only problem is how long the state ruled by unions of miners is gonna last before collapsing into internal struggle?"
