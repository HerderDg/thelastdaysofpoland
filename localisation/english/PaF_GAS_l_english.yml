GAS_chemia_1: "Chemical Arsenal - Passive Deterrence"
GAS_chemia_1_desc: "Nominally unused and kept in reserve during the Invasion, the regiment in Brodnica housed a contingency plan even some of the more drumbeating supporters of the war hesitated to unleash - it sits on the largest stockpile of chemical weapons possessed by the Third Republic. With no government left to relocate them once the hostilities ended, they remain as a powerful deterrent for anyone willing to try bringing the Garrison to heel. Unleashing these horrors upon the battlefield would earn us widespread condemnation. §RThis option should only be considered as a last resort.§!"

GAS_rozkaz: "The Final Order"
GAS_rozkaz_desc: "Our orders were clear: 'Stay in your barracks and prepare for the worst.' War came. War went. The country collapsed; so did the voivodeship administration. The army failed in its responsibilities. Then it failed again. And still, we waited. Upon enlistment, we swore an oath to serve the Republic of Poland. Unfortunately, that polity no longer exists. That does not mean we have been relieved of our duties, however. Eventually, the country will reform itself, and we will welcome its officials with open arms. Until then, we will safeguard our home city of Brodnica from any illegitimate warlord that tries to add it to their domain. So help us God!"
