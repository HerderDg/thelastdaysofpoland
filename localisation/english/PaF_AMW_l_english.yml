unification.177.t: "[GetNewspaper]Tribunal of Sobriety unifies Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.177.desc: "The strikes of a gavel silence Łódzkie's squabbling warlords. A retired judge with an exceptional resume and popular TV personality - Anna Maria Wesołowska, has gathered enough support to expand her kritarchic state to encompass the whole voivodeship. Before the Fall, the jurist engaged in activism against the legalization and even depenalization of narcotics, especially marijuana. As she confessed, the sad state of Polish society after 2025, especially the demoralization among the children, caused her to adopt an even stricter approach, leading a temperance crusade against every single drug, including alcohol and nicotine. Though many expect the endeavor to fail, considering how much the former is engraved in Polish culture, Wesołowska's supporters claim that her experience dealing with organized crime will help her successfully stop the vast majority of producers, smugglers, and dealers, while her expertise in prevention and youth education will ingrain the values of abstinence in the Polish nation."
