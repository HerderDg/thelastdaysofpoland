unification.177.t: "[GetNewspaper]Tribunal of Sobriety unifies Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.177.desc: "The strikes of a gavel silence Łódzkie's squabbling warlords. A retired judge with an exceptional resume and popular TV personality - Anna Maria Wesołowska, has gathered enough support to expand her kritarchic state to encompass the whole voivodeship. Before the Fall, the jurist engaged in activism against the legalization and even depenalization of narcotics, especially marijuana. As she confessed, the sad state of Polish society after 2025, especially the demoralization among the children, caused her to adopt an even stricter approach, leading a temperance crusade against every single drug, including alcohol and nicotine. Though many expect the endeavor to fail, considering how much the former is engraved in Polish culture, Wesołowska's supporters claim that her experience dealing with organized crime will help her successfully stop the vast majority of producers, smugglers, and dealers, while her expertise in prevention and youth education will ingrain the values of abstinence in the Polish nation."

AMW_dry_justice_desc: "Anna Maria Wesołowska is a well-respected expert in matters of organized crime. She’s a co-author of the pre-Fall State Evidence Act. She was a member of the adjudicating panel during the trials of the Octopus and Popelina gangs. In the last years before the war, she dedicated herself to combating the rising usage of drugs among the youth. Her experience allowed her to quell any chaos and illegal activity on the territories she now controls, creating a stable and safe community and a state apparatus that is capable of subjugating new territories."

AMW_koluszki_hub: "Hub of Koluszki"
AMW_koluszki_hub_desc: "The Łódź railway system has always been severely lacking. The nuclear explosion in Bałuty made things even worse. This cascade failure of the infrastructure made the Koluszki railway junction - an already important element of the local transportation system - a true gateway to the eastern half of Poland. Whoever controls it can use it to bolster their supply chain, providing soldiers with the food and ammunition more quickly than their opponents. They can also benefit from increased income from fees put on foreign trains travelling through Koluszki. "

AMW_anti_temperance_league: "Anti-Temperance League"
AMW_anti_temperance_league_desc: "While many are thankful that Judge Wesołowska helps with providing order, many of them are disturbed by her radicalism regarding the Rule of Sobriety. She expanded the so-called Nightly Prohibition to all the provinces, sometimes in spite of the local self-governments. She has also delegalized marijuana for medical usage. Many believe that in time, she will outright ban the possession, production, and usage of alcohol under any circumstances. Those actions caused various hobos, stoners, and junkies to form an Anti-Temperance League aimed at subverting Judge’s activities. If Wesołowska continues getting tougher on drugs, even ordinary citizens may join the League’s ranks."
