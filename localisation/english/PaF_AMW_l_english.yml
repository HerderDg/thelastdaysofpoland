unification.177.desc: "Strikes of gavel silence squabbling Łódź warlords. Anna Maria Wesołowska, a retired judge with an exceptional resume and popular TV personality gathered enough support to expand her kritarchic state to encompass the whole voivodeship. Before the Fall, she engaged in activism against the legalization or even depenalization of narcotics, especially marijuana. As she confessed, the sad state of Polish society after 2025 and especially demoralization among the children, caused her to adopt an even stricter approach. Now she leads a temperance crusade against every single drug, including alcohol and nicotine. Many expect her endeavor to fail, considering how much the former is engraved in Polish culture. However, her supporters claim that her experience dealing with organized crime will help her successfully stop the vast majority of producers, dealers, and smugglers and her instance in the prevention and education of youth will permanently ingrain the values of abstinence in the Polish nation."
