unification.30.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Torcida Zabrze unifies Upper Silesia!"
unification.30.desc:0 ""We're fighting very well, both defensively and offensively. – repeated Adam Nawałka, coach of Górnik Zabrze. And in fact, his "team" achieved incredible successes. The fans, however, are a bit confused - they don't quite know what they would prefer more; the league championship or the unification of the Silesian metropolis by the ultras of Górnik Zabrze, the famous Torcida. However, they got the latter.\n\nThe bells rang throughout Zabrze while the symbolic transfer of the hen to the coach took place at the Górnik stadium (with the newly built fourth stand). The Coach. A man, who became an icon, and unlike his Truskolasy counterpart, he did not forcibly introduce a cult of personality. But how to organize a country whose strength consists of poorly brained hooligans, and whose leader really is only a neurotic that manages run-of-the-mill football club?"
unification.30.a:0 "We are The Boys from Zabrze!"
