unification.116.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Bielany unifies the Capital District!"
unification.116.desc:0 "Today Vocalist Podsiadło, formerly artist and now charismatic leader of Bielany Union of Feminists, declared in his announcement successful seizure of all the lands of former capital city area. \n\nModel country, to which aspires Podsiadło, is built on decentralized economy (so-called Small-Town system) and negation of patriarchy. The Vocalist truly believes in progressive and feminist values, although in his country law enforcement duties are held by The Pink Shirts, truly ruthless and fierce militia. Not hesitant with dealing brutally with his enemies, Podsiadło does not see a problem with installing a de facto totalitarian regime while speaking about tolerance, European values and equality. Therefore the fate of newly conquered lands is currently unknown."
