unification.116.t: "[GetNewspaper]Bielany unify the Capital District!"
unification.116.desc: "Totalitarian regimes were an expected outcome of Poland’s collapse, especially amongst those more cynical. However grim or outlandish expectations of those observing the situation from the outside might’ve been, news emerging from the city of Warsaw have stunned everyone equally. Dawid Podsiadło, a singer and as of a few years ago the charismatic leader of the Bielany Union of Feminists, announced his group’s successful seizure of Warsaw and its surrounding provinces. His state champions the negation of patriarchy and a unique economic “Small-Town System”, meant to destroy the big cities’ hegemony on power within the nation. Podsiadło’s clique preaches and enforces progressive and feminist values, with the help of a relentless militia known as the Pink Shirts. Not hesitant to squash any opposition, Podsiadło claims that tolerance, European values and true equality only befit a strongman, not any passive protester."
unification.116.a: "A Smalltownsman in a Big City."
