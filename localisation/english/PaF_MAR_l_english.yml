 unification.170.t: "[GetNewspaper]Mariavite Church unifies North Masovia!"
 unification.170.desc: "In Płock, in front of the newly reclaimed Temple of Mercy and Charity, Archibishop Maria Jan Opala gives a speech calming the population declaring peaceful intents and detailing the obscure Mariavite doctrine to a wider population. Before they unified the northern part of Masovian voivodeship, the Mariavites were cast out of their main cathedral in Płock. They entrenched themselves in no man's land between the capital of Masovian dukes, Płońsk and Sochaczew. Soon, the strictly Polish heritage of the denomination, religious songs based on well-known patriotic marches, and their insistence on almsgiving won them much popularity. All those factors coupled with the passivity of Roman Catholic hierarchs to the excesses of Morawiecki and Obajtek allowed the Marivites to triumph. Will they retain their non-aggressive outlook? Or will the so-far-marginal voices calling for a more martial approach rise to the top?"
 unification.170.a: "'We shall not forsake the deed!'"
 
super.170.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
