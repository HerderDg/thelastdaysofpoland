 unification.170.t: "[GetNewspaper]Mariavite Church unifies Northern Masovia!"
 unification.170.desc: "In Płock, in front of the newly reclaimed Temple of Mercy and Charity, Archbishop Maria Jan Opala gave a speech calming the population, declaring his peaceful intent and detailing the obscure Mariavite doctrine to the wider population. Before they unified the northern part of the Masovian voivodeship, the Mariavites had long been cast out of their main cathedral in Płock. They had entrenched themselves in the no man's land between the capital of Masovian dukes and the cities of Płońsk and Sochaczew. Soon, the strictly Polish heritage of the denomination, religious songs based on well-known patriotic marches, and their insistence on almsgiving won them much popularity. All those factors, coupled with the passiveness of the Roman Catholic hierarchs to the excesses of Morawiecki and Obajtek, allowed the Marivites to triumph. Will they retain their non-aggressive outlook? Or will the so-far-marginal voices calling for a more martial approach rise to the top?"
