ZUK_the_mayor_in_exile:0 "The Mayor in Exile"
ZUK_the_mayor_in_exile_desc:0 "Krzysztof Żuk has been governing Lublin for many years, and when the country started collapsing he was the only person who could save the city from complete chaos. Unfortunately, he was unable to stay in power for long, and after a coup he now finds himself exiled in Chełm. It is now his duty to do everything in his power to liberate Lublin and bring back freedom and democracy to the city, as well as its region along the way. Not only for the sake of Lublinians, but for the whole voivodeship as well."

ZUK_a_reunited_council:0 "A reunited Council"
ZUK_a_reunited_council_desc:0 "The Mayor is not alone. Over the last months many representatives of former Lublinian administration managed to make their way to the League and joined its ranks. The old City Council members now form a bulk of our new provisional government in Chełm. Without their expertize and loyalty, Żuk could never come as far as he already did in his quest of liberating Lublin and the region."

ZUK_overview_of_the_economy:0 "Overview of the economy"
ZUK_overview_of_the_economy_desc:0 "The economy lies in ruins, and it is up to us to pick up the pieces. Fortunately many members of our governent, including the Mayor, have a background in economics. Hopefully their experience will help us rebuild some of our industry and infrastructure. For now, we have to examine what industrial resources are actually available at our disposal, so that we can evaluate our future prospects."

ZUK_consolidation_of_our_resources:0 "Consolidation of our resources"
ZUK_consolidation_of_our_resources_desc:0 "Unfortunately the Chełm area has never been highly developed economically, being more of an agricultural region. Still, there is some amount of industrial infrastructure scattered around, and we must make the best use of it. Being so isolated economically poses a great challenge as well, since the factories don't have access to the resources of the whole country anymore, but we must try to adapt and utilize whatever little there is left."

ZUK_repurpose_concrete_factories:0 "Repurpose concrete factories"
ZUK_repurpose_concrete_factories_desc:0 "Out of all industrial plants located in our territory, some of the most potentially useful are the concrete factories in Chełm and Rejowiec Fabryczny. If we manage to make them work somewhat efficiently again, building construction will certainly become easier and faster, and it would give us a valuable resource for trading with some of our neighbors."

ZUK_infrastructure_maintenance:0 "Infrastructure maintenance"
ZUK_infrastructure_maintenance_desc:0 "The region's road network, not very impressive to begin with, has suffered even more in the last year. The severe winter coupled with neglect caused by the nationwide chaos meant that today many roads are in need of serious maintenance and repairs. We cannot fix every pothole in our territory, but at least we can try and keep main roads in Chełm and the countryside in a decent condition."

ZUK_recycled_makeshift_weapons:0 "Recycled makeshift weapons"
ZUK_recycled_makeshift_weapons_desc:0 "Not every piece of equipment will be useful in our reorganized industry, but it doesn't mean that much of it has to go to waste. Many pieces of scrap could be repurposed as provisional weapons for our defense forces, especially since their presence seems to be increasingly important. These weapons obviously won't be of a very good quality, but in these circumstances beggars can't be choosers."

ZUK_provisional_weapon_factories:0 "Provisional weapon factories"
ZUK_provisional_weapon_factories_desc:0 "Whether we like it or not, while rebuilding the economy of our region we cannot forget about defense equipment manufacturing. Our men will need more and more weapons, and we can recycle only so much from the unused scraps. We have to organize new workshops, so that we can keep our forces supplied. This would also allow us to keep improving the quality of their gear."

ZUK_improved_living_conditions:0 "Improved living conditions"
ZUK_improved_living_conditions_desc:0 "Our economic reorganization has started to bear fruit, which can be noticed even by the regular people under our administration. Access to basic goods and overall quality of life have visibly improved over the last months, and while it's still nowhere near close to what it was before the country fell, it does bring people some hope - and gives the provisional government more legitimacy."

ZUK_trade_with_bilgoraj_conglomerate:0 "Trade with Biłgoraj comglomerate"
ZUK_trade_with_bilgoraj_conglomerate_desc:0 "Out of all rival governments that surround us, the corporate state to the south seems to be the least unreasonable one. We probably won't ever be able to call them our actual friends, but they will likely be open for some mutually beneficial trade, at least for now. We can produce concrete for example, so we might exchange it for some other valuable resources."

ZUK_trade_with_the_ukrainians:0 "Trade with the Ukrainians"
ZUK_trade_with_the_ukrainians_desc:0 "For a long time thousands of Ukrainians lived in Lublin, and the Mayor has always welcomed them warmly, unlike the current occupants of the city. Even though Ukraine is in a rough spot itself, our friends on the other side of Bug river surely remember our bond, and would likely be willing to provide us some amount of material support in exchange of excess materials we have at our disposal."

ZUK_new_lublian_army:0 "New Lublinian Army"
ZUK_new_lublian_army_desc:0 "The mostly non-violent means of expanding our influence in an actual lawless anarchy have reached their limit. If we want to remain independent from the surrounding rival governments today, and liberate Lublin in the future, we need to form a strong, well-organized army. It probably won't be impressively equipped or hugely numerous, but we will make sure it does the job done."

ZUK_lublinian_volunteers:0 "Lublinan volunteers"
ZUK_lublinian_volunteers_desc:0 "Many Lublinians decided to leave their homes and managed to make their way to the League, so that they can join our forces, or at least find a safe refuge. As a result, a significant portion of our army is made of these Lublinian volunteers. We must keep encouraging the refugees to enlist, especially since they often turn out to be one of the most dedicated troops in our ranks."

ZUK_encourage_local_conscription:0 "Encourage local conscription"
ZUK_encourage_local_conscription_desc:0 "Local people under our administration are often reluctant about joining our armed forces, since they don't care about some distant city and are more concerned about their own home and safety. While this may seem like a valid point, we must convince them that our ultimate goal is to bring back freedom and safety to the whole region, not only the voivodeship's capital."

ZUK_the_goat_division:0 "The Goat Division"
ZUK_the_goat_division_desc:0 "Among our conscripts there is a number of men who have recieved a professional military training in the past, and are especially eager and loyal to our cause. We shall organize them into an elite unit, which will be called Goat Division - after the goat which is historically the symbol of Lublin. This will improve not only our fighting strength, but hopefully our army's morale as well."

ZUK_swaying_the_public:0 "Swaying the public"
ZUK_swaying_the_public_desc:0 "If we really want to be seen as liberators and not just some another statelet led by dictators or madmen, we need to focus on improving our public image. Beata Stepaniuk-Kuśmierzak, Mayor's right hand, will be overseeing our efforts to earn trust of people under administration, and make them see that their issues are important to us."

ZUK_close_to_the_people:0 "Close to the people"
ZUK_close_to_the_people_desc:0 "One of the best way to earn people's trust is to become more accessible to them. Mayor's office in Chełm will be always open for citizens, and also he or his representatives be regularly visiting various towns and meeting with their inhabitants there. People will see that we are not some cold, distant rulers, but regular people like them."

ZUK_radio_free_lublin:0 "Radio Free Lublin"
ZUK_radio_free_lublin_desc:0 "Country's collapse and the severe energy shortages made most of our everyday technology completely unreliable. Radio is the excepcion, and we shall capitalize on that. We will start our own radio station targeted to listeners not only in our territory, but also in Lublin and in the whole voivodeship, so that as many people as possible can hear about our cause and, hopefully, get convinced to it."

ZUK_safe_haven_for_refugees:0 "Safe haven for refugees"
ZUK_safe_haven_for_refugees_desc:0 "A lot of people are being persecuted under our rival governments, especially in Lublin and western part of the voivodeship. They need to know that whenever they come from, they will always be welcomed in our territory and will find safety under our administration. We will utilize our radio to keep reminding people of that."

ZUK_reassure_local_population:0 "Reassure local population"
ZUK_reassure_local_population_desc:0 "A common source of people's distrust towards us is the fact that we are tied to a big, seemingly distant city, and we often use it in our rhetoric. Some people think that this makes us not actually care about their own region and its local identity. We must show them that this is far from truth, and we actually care about them as much as we would care about Lublinians."

ZUK_promise_local_elections:0 "Promise local elections"
ZUK_promise_local_elections_desc:0 "When we were expanding our influence and taking over new towns and villages, unfortunately we were forced to remove from posts some remaining representatives of local pre-collapse administration who weren't willing to fully cooperate with us. This has angered many people, but if we promise that we will organize new local, fully democratic elections when the situation becomes more stable, hopefully it will be enough calm them down for now."

ZUK_beacon_of_freedom:0 "Beacon of freedom"
ZUK_beacon_of_freedom_desc:0 "Out of all governments in the region, our administration is certainly the most fair and safe one, and the people appreciate their freedom more and more. Even thoug they initially were distrustful of us, today our public support only seems to be growing."

ZUK_liberators_of_the_city:0 "Liberators of the City"
ZUK_liberators_of_the_city_desc:0 "We are Lublinians and we are proud of that. Lublin with its inhabitants is being held hostage by evil forces, and it is our duty to come to its aid. Krzysztof Żuk is the only legitimate, democratically elected mayor of the city, and we will make sure he comes back to his post, so that Lublin may prosper again, and its people won't have to be afraid anymore."

ZUK_liberators_of_the_voivodeship:0 "Liberators of the Voivodeship"
ZUK_liberators_of_the_voivodeship_desc:0 "Even though we are tied do the city of Lublin, we have the good of whole voivodeship at heart. Our goal is to bring liberty to the whole region, and make sure all of its people feel safe and free, wherever they are. Doesn't matter if you live in a big city or some remote village - if you are under our administration, we'll be there to hear about your issues."

ZUK_on_the_warpath:0 "On the Warpath"
ZUK_on_the_warpath_desc:0 "Our borders are stabilized, most pressing issues resolved, the army created. The stage is set for our next steps, which unfortunately most likely will mean armed conflicts. The rumors suggest our neighbors are gearing up their forces as well, so at this point the war seems inevitable. But we will be ready for it, and in the end we shall emerge victorious!"

zuk.t1_1.t:0 "The Exile"
zuk.t1_1.desc:0 "On a sunny day like today, it is possible to see several tall Lublinian structures from a hill near Rejowiec, from a distance of over 50 kilometers. Roofs of two buildings in LSM, a radio tower near the city center, a large chimney of the power plant in Tatary and, most distinctly of all, another, even larger chimney in Wrotków. In a few hours, when the night will set in, its slowly pulsating red light will be clearly visible on the horizon even with a naked eye.\n\nKrzysztof Żuk put the binoculars down, and sighed quietly. He figured he could do this little detour, since he and his assistant were driving from Chełm to Krasnystaw area anyway, for another regional inspection. And he really needed any break he could get. The last few months have been so incredibly hectic and stressful, and it felt like they were as long as the previous sixteen years he spent in office as the Mayor of Lublin. Back when everything was still normal. When Lublin wasn’t a warzone.\n\nŻuk passed the binoculars to the assistant, and while she was observing the view over the next several minutes, he just tried to clear his head. He let the nostalgia set in. He thought about the city he was so attached to, and imagined that it was still a place of peace and growth, like before. Before it was dominated by Czarnek’s thugs and by misguided anarchists.\n\nThe assistant eventually put down the binoculars, and turned her face to Żuk. He could clearly see that she became emotional as well, even if she didn’t say a word. But in the end they both knew that they still had a lot of work to do today, and it was time for them to return to the nearby parked car and to go on with their duties."
