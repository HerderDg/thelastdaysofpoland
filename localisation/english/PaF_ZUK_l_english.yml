zuk.t1_1.t:0 "The Exile"
zuk.t1_1.desc:0 "On a sunny day like today, it is possible to see several tall Lublinian structures from a hill near Rejowiec, from a distance of over 50 kilometers. Roofs of two blocks in LSM, a radio tower near the city center, a large chimney of the power plant in Tatary and, most distinctly of all, another, even larger chimney in Wrotków. In a few hours, when the night will set in, its slowly pulsating red light will be clearly visible on the horizon even with a naked eye.\n\nKrzysztof Żuk put the binoculars down, and sighed quietly. He figured he could do this little detour, since he and his assistant were driving from Chełm to Krasnystaw area anyway, for another regional inspection. And he really needed any break he could get. The last few months have been so incredibly hectic and stressful, and it felt like they were as long as the previous sixteen years he spent in office as the Mayor of Lublin. Back when everything was still normal. When Lublin wasn’t a warzone.\n\nŻuk passed the binoculars to the assistant, and while she was observing the view over the next several minutes, he just tried to clear his head. He let the nostalgia set in. He thought about the city he was so attached to, and imagined that it was still a place of peace and growth, like before. Before it was dominated by Czarnek’s thugs and by misguided anarchists.\n\nThe assistant eventually put down the binoculars, and turned her face to Żuk. He could clearly see that she became emotional as well, even if she didn’t say a word. But in the end they both knew that they still had a lot of work to do today, and it was time for them to return to the nearby parked car and to go on with their duties."
