unification.82.t: "[GetNewspaper]Krajna Regionalists unify Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.82.desc: "From the idyllic fields of the Western Kuyavian Flatlands, an unlikely polity has established its control over the voivodeship. The 'Krajna-Kuyavia Federation,' as the newfound state provisionally refers to itself, is a complicated patchwork of regionalist groups and local governments, focused on promoting a return to the country's simpler, yet culturally far richer past. Despite the appearance of a unified political entity, the federation is highly decentralized, as each region effectively governs itself, with only a symbolic degree of power being centrally held and enforced via consensus. For now, this institutional freedom has paid dividends, with countless volunteers fighting fiercely to defend their homes and liberate the voivodeship from authoritarian rule, but this communal spirit can only get them so far. Standing at the crossroads between complete autonomy and a union of equals, the polity functions in a state of internal contradiction. Without immediate reform, the regionalist dream is certain to be short-lived."
