unification.82.desc:0 "Back in the reigns, the rightful government of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship has regained control over the whole region. Managing to quell the various religious institutions that gained sway over the south and the mutinous army remnants in the east, they have been met with open arms by the local population. \n\nTheir return has been a sigh of relief for many, as the Voivode has long been seen as a beacon of stability to rally around following the Fall. While turbulent times made that more or less true as time went on, one thing is certain - the Voivode is here to stay for good this time. \n\nWith a cadre of skilled ministers and government workers on his side, Piotr Całbecki is ready to face the future. "
