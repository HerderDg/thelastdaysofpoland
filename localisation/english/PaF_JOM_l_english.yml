 JOM_ny_saga: "Ný Saga"
 JOM_ny_saga_desc: "Enter the story of gods and heroes, where the improbable meets the impossible, where the tale begins with an exiled man with ambitions reaching the stars. This man is destined to travel beyond the sea to meet his faith. He's going to achieve greatness, like every hero does. Of course, one can be great and venerated, as well as one can be great and feared. Alas, everyone has their dark side. And this journey shall not be an easy feat, as the inner demons and outside threats will block any rays of hope. It's a story about finding their own identity. About ordinary humans battling the giants. About a man with a fire in his eyes, who wants to revolutionize his country in ways unimaginable. This change shall come with the tides. Tides that will sweep the rotten liberalism out of the face of Midgard. This is the saga of Adrian Zandberg."
 
 JOM_folkvangr_enclave: "Fólkvangr Enclave"
 JOM_folkvangr_enclave_desc: "Far from the fjords and frozen hearths of the North, they came - those who would not kneel to foreign kings, nor abandon the gods of their fathers. Cast into exile, they carved a refuge from stone and wind, and named it Fólkvangr, after the sacred field where half of the honoured dead rest beneath Freyja's gaze.\n\nIn this strange land, the spirit of the North endures. The scent of pine smoke drifts through the air, mingling with the ring of hammers on steel. Mead is poured in hand-carved halls, sagas are recited as gospel, and children learn to carry both shield and verse.\n\nFor the day will come when the horn sounds, and Ragnarök begins."
 
 JOM_who_am_i: "Who Am I?"
 JOM_who_am_i_desc: "Halfdan Sandbjerg. Harald. Adrian Zandberg.\nThe names swirled like mist in his mind. Was he a Viking or a politician? A raider or a man of the people? A distant land called to him across the sea. Should he sail for it, sword in hand? Plunder its riches? Set its shores ablaze in glory and wrath? No... no, it was different. That land - he knew it. He remembered its rivers, its sorrows, its people. But not who he had been among them. He must help them. He must take from them. He must become... something new. But still the question burned behind his eyes, as cold as the northern wind:\n\n§RWho is he?§!"
 
 JOM_what_am_i_doing: "What Am I Doing?"
 JOM_what_am_i_doing_desc: "Sandbjerg's main concern was not the cold, nor the hunger, nor even the war drums echoing in the Bornholm island. It was the question that gnawed at his soul - what was he actually doing? He was a jarl, yes. He led bloodthirsty warriors across the shattered coastlines of the Baltic, promising gold, glory, and a place in the halls of Valhalla. They drank to his name. They sang of his victories. His banners flew high over ruined towns. But as the fires burned and the ships returned heavy with spoils, doubt clung to him like salt on the wind.\nWas he truly born to raid?\nOr was there still a man, Adrian Zandberg, somewhere beneath the helm and beard?\n\nHe could not answer.\n\n§RHe could only sail forward.§!"
 
 JOM_assembling_banners: "Assembling the Banners"
 JOM_assembling_banners_desc: "We must reclaim our land and return to the beloved embrace of beautiful Poland, shamelessly taken from us by treacherous, honorless rats. But to achieve this goal, we need people: brave, strong warriors who, under Jarl Sandbjerg's command, will reclaim what is rightfully ours. The time has come to send out the call to all refugees; the Gjallarhorn sounds, summoning them to battle. May Thor forge their hearts into those warriors who are ready to answer Odin's call. Sandbjerg will lead us back to the soil that bore us, the land so vilely stolen from us."
 
 JOM_aid_from_aalborg: "Aid from Aalborg"
 JOM_aid_from_aalborg_desc: "Aalborg may have been the place of our leader's birth - yet there the tale of our dealings with the kingdom of Denmark largely ends. Still, the Danes are a people of some kindness, and surely they will aid us, the poor exiles. Every loaf of bread, every scrap of cloth must be accepted, for the families of our warriors must be kept whole and fed before husbands march on the great raid.\n\nWhy not petition the capital? Because eyes at the center are sharp, and we cannot let them see us for what we truly are - not mere wanderers, not helpless refugees seeking shelter, but a host of armed men with a purpose that would rattle their bones. They would not forgive such a revelation. So we move quietly, securing for our folk only what is needed to endure, until the time comes to truly live."
 
 JOM_invigilaltion_from_kaupmannahofn: "Invigilation from Kaupmannahöfn"
 JOM_invigilaltion_from_kaupmannahofn_desc: "We miscalculated; the Danes turned out to be neither as naive nor as gullible as we had anticipated. They did not buy the tale that we are just poor refugees from a shattered homeland. Perhaps setting up a camp filled with Viking shields, banners, and weapons was not the most tactically sound way to conceal our true intentions. And now, they dare to send in inspectors, hoping to catch us red-handed. Let them try, but they will not dig us out that easily; Odin will protect us from their malicious approach to our cause. "
 
 JOM_smuggling_resources: "Smuggling Resources and Weapons"
 JOM_smuggling_resources_desc: "We already have an army, but they will not be throwing stones at the enemy or surviving on sunlight and empty promises from their commanders. We need weapons, food, and uniforms, and we cannot expect support from the Danish. Unlike the Max Kolonko Americanists, we do not have the luxury of a powerful American ally providing resources freely. We must arm and feed ourselves. While we can produce some supplies ourselves, we may need to consider resorting to the black market if necessary. If we are to survive and carve out a future worth fighting for, we must be as ruthless in logistics as we are in battle."
 
 JOM_hundred_drakkars: "A Hundred Drakkars"
 JOM_hundred_drakkars_desc: "As the lands across the sea darken as blood falls, we stand stalwart, for we know our bands of Vikings, like Ragnarok, will storm with a force beyond that of even the hammer of Thor or the fires of Surtr. Yet, we can't arrive at our destination! For we have no war fleet to parade onto Poland's shores. We have few materials to construct Drakkars, making taking from the people whose land we occupy is the most efficient, by any means necessary, whether it be force, or bountiful mischief. Let us pray to Loki! For the potency of his mischief may swindle us a fleet big enough to put fear in even the giants!"
 
 JOM_great_heathen_army: "Great Heathen Army"
 JOM_great_heathen_army_desc: "As our banner grows in size underneath the watchful eye of the Danish, we must ponder and look at the men that we see fleeing into our ranks. Whether it be those who we suspect, like refugees who wave our banner and chant Jarl's name. Or those we wouldn't expect, like by the grace of Tyr, defectors from the Polish army and navy. Yet with this minor influx of people, we stand firm. We must organize these groups into true Warbands and equip them with not only equipment, but faith for miles and belief in our cause and in our deities to truly be considered a Great Army of Heathens."
 
 JOM_housecarls_of_sammen: "Housecarls of the Sammen"
 JOM_housecarls_of_sammen_desc: "Those who demonstrate the highest tier of loyalty underneath our banner shall be allowed entry into an elite force blessed by Thor's hammer, the Housecarls! These men shall be imbued with the strength of ten men, and marked by various sigils and runes of their choice. Although some within the party question the purpose of the Housecarls and say it's simply a party militia, we argue back! For they don't understand that a protection force of our land, not just an assault force, is greatly important! Although... they shall be put to assault for the first coming wars..."
 
 JOM_agents_of_loki: "Agents of Loki"
 JOM_agents_of_loki_desc: "Across the narrow sea, there are still those who quietly raise toasts to the health and wellbeing of our leader underneath the boots of the factions and banners they remain under. With many being those of whom will be ready to unleash hell upon the occupiers at the first signal for an uprising. We must establish contact with these cells of deception on the coast to let them know of our arrival as their treachery on the lands they stay on will make them legends within our lands. We must tell them to be ready, for our efforts without them shall be many miles more difficult.."
 
 JOM_sound_the_horn: "Sound the Gjallarhorn!"
 JOM_sound_the_horn_desc: "When Heimdall shall sound his horn, the sons of Asgard will march to their doom. The foulest beasts shall stir, spawn of darkness, thirsting to devour Midgard. Gods will clash, brother against brother, and mankind shall be swept away in the fire of their fury.\n\nSo spoke the old sagas, and now it comes to pass in the shattered lands of the Eurokommissariats. Strife boils like storm-tossed seas, when the unjust lords tear at each other with iron and spite.\n\nNow is the hour foretold.\nNow we take up our axes, as our forebears did,\nAnd with steel and wrath,\nWe bring ruin to the false kings and burn their thrones to ash."

Viðsjórsteinn and Halsvik free! A feast is owed, but not today.

Let us sharpen the axes, prepare the arms, for Fenrir already circles, and we stride straight into the heart of chaos - there is where we go to fight.\nYet none of us shall fall to Hel. TODAY IN VALHALLA, WE MEET ALL!"

 JOM_looting_churches: "Looting the Churches"
 JOM_looting_churches_desc: "Even now, after war and thunder have swept across Pomerania, the old churches remain heavy with gold. War has passed like a winter storm, but within these stone halls, wealth still clings to the shadows - chalices, reliquaries, tapestries, untouched by hunger, untouched by loss.\n\nMany wonder how such treasures stayed untouched when so much else was broken. How the altars stayed polished, while villages were burned, and children grew up with empty stomachs.\n\nAmong those who now wander through the vast coastal lands, there are whispers about the church's riches. What good is the gold serving while sealed away in tombs of faith, when the living have nothing?"

 JOM_germanic_equipment: "Germanic Equipment"
 JOM_germanic_equipment_desc: "When Ragnarök swept through the land of Pomerania, it came not with glory, but with fire, blood, and steel. The Saxon invaders, unready for the fury that fell upon them, fled before our advance. In their retreat, they left behind weapons, armour, and gear - precious tools forged for war, now claimed by our mighty Vikings. What they abandoned in fear shall now fuel our wrath. Their iron feeds our forges, their steel arms our warriors. From the ashes of their defeat, we rise stronger, guided by the will of the old gods and the unyielding north wind. "

 JOM_retake_jomsborg_desc: "The winds have blown us off course, and we landed where we did not intend, yet perhaps fate was kind. The shore of Bornholm that greeted us was not the one we sought, but it gave us shelter and time to gather our strength.\n\nNow, we must set our course true once more. Jomsborg must be reclaimed.\n\nThat isle is no mere rock in the sea; it is sacred land, soaked in the blood and honor of our ancestors. It is where the runes were first carved into stone, and where Thor's hammer shielded the free folk against tyrants. Jomsborg is the heart of our saga, and it shall beat once more. "

 JOM_northern_flank: "Northern Flank"
 JOM_northern_flank_desc: "We can see Jomsborg right in front of us. Our Viking spirit urges us to strike immediately, without considering the potential dangers. However, it would be unwise to assault an area where we are already expected; there will be many future opportunities to prove ourselves worthy of a place in Valhalla. The best strategy is to approach from the North by capturing the city of Dziwnów, which will confuse our enemies who are prepared for a frontal attack on their positions. Although we will have to travel some distance, with Odin's strength on our side, it will be worth it."

 JOM_direct_strike: "Direct Strike at the City"
 JOM_direct_strike_desc: "To Helheim with that! Who needs strategy when the blood of berserkers boils in our veins? Our warriors will tear through the dissenters like wolves through sheep. Let them cower behind their walls; it will not save them. Jomsborg lies just beyond the river, close enough to taste their fear.\n\nWhat force could ever stop us? It is our birthright, our sacred ground. We shall take it not with caution, but with fury, steel, and the thunderous roar of unchained warriors. Let the earth shake beneath our boots, Jomsborg will fall by dawn."

 JOM_back_in_home_desc: "Our sacred city has been retaken from the Wends, and at long last, we can walk its grounds not as strangers, but as heirs. The festival fires are lit once more, and the banners of our forefathers rise high above the old burial mounds. We may now visit the tomb of Harald Bluetooth without shame, speak the names of our ancestors aloud, and feel the spirits stir. Let the drums thunder and the horns sound across the hills, Jomsborg is ours again. Let no enemy set foot here again, for now and always, it stands as a beacon of the North reborn."

 JOM_memories_of_past: "Memories of the Past"
 JOM_memories_of_past_desc: "Our jarl, Halfdan Sandbjerg, walks these fertile lands with pride, but shadows linger around him. Whispers among the people suggest that he was once imprisoned by the Germans, tormented by their ruthless regime. It is said that the iron forged in that suffering shaped the mighty warrior we follow today, a man who was broken, reforged, and set free upon the world. His fury led us to victory, and his vision carved our path through ice and fire. However, some fear that ghosts of his past are stirring again, that old pain gnaws at his heart, and buried truths claw their way to the surface from the dark. Let us pray that the gods fortify his spirit before it shatters."

 JOM_first_althing: "First Althing"
 JOM_first_althing_desc: "At last, our situation in Pomerania stands firm. We have seized enough land to plant the roots of our new realm. In response, Jarl Halfdan has summoned the first Althing, a gathering meant to forge the path toward stability and prosperity.\n\nBut let the scribes talk, and the wise mutter in circles. For the warriors of the north, this is but pretense. What we crave is war. A holy crusade to tear the chains from the Pomeranian lands, chains forged by Christians, liberals, and treacherous Wends. Let them tremble, as our mighty warriors will make their regimes crumble. Till Valhall!"

 JOM_skeggold_desc: "The winds of change blow with rising fury. The hour draws near - when wolves shall tear asunder those who dared call themselves gods of these lands. From the North comes a tide of reckoning, bearing on its axes the doom of Saxon oppressors and Wendish pretenders alike. Drums. The drums of war echo through the deepest hollows of this land. It is time.\nTime for our heroes to complete the apocalyptic work begun long ago - to end this cruel war, and lead us to the green meadows of Gimlé, where no shadow may follow.\n\nWe are coming.\n\nAxe-age, sword-age - shields are cloven -\nWind-age, wolf-age, before the world collapses;\nNo one will show mercy to another."

 JOM_expand_coastline_desc: "On our eastern border lies a mockery of justice, a gilded haven carved out by the treacherous Wends, where only the richest of their kind may feast, while their common folk are left to rot in squalor. A so-called vacation country, built on the sweat and blood of the forgotten.\n\nIt is our sacred duty, blessed by Thor's thunderous wrath, to bring ruin to their pleasure resorts. We shall storm their hotels, tear down their false idols, and seize what was hoarded. The riches of the elite shall be returned to those who truly deserve them - the sons and daughters of Pomerania."

We will march in broad formation, shoulder to shoulder, along the entire frontier, ensuring that no corner of these lands remains unclaimed. From the whispering marshes to the rolling hills, our warband advances as one thunderous tide, liberating every hidden glen and hotel in our path. Pinnastrond will fall, and with it, every bourgeoisie. Let the earth tremble beneath our feet, and may the wind carry our battle cry: the North returns, and none shall stand in its way."

 JOM_pinnastrond_raid_desc: "Two hundred drakkars will thunder like a storm as they approach this coastal city, their dragon-prows cutting through the waves toward the pale sands of Pinnastrond. At dawn, we will pour ashore in unbroken ranks, shields locked and axes bared, causing the gilded promenades of the Kurortstaat to quake beneath our boots. No enemy line will withstand our fury; no walls will stand against the roar of our horns. In a single, thunderous blow, we will claim every spa, every pier, and every hotel. With that, this war will come to an end. Let the sagas record this day: how the North reclaimed what rightfully belonged to the people!"

 JOM_vacation_over: "Vacation is Over!"
 JOM_vacation_over_desc: "The Pinnastrond and its golden shores are now ours. The days of extravagant vacations are over; no more idle lounging for the elite while the people suffer. Our Viking banners now fly high above the former luxury hotels, which were once the playgrounds of the wealthy.\n\nNow, these lands serve a new purpose. No longer symbols of excess, they will be seized, reclaimed, and repurposed to benefit the general population. The wealth of the coast will be taken from the privileged and shared among the common folk, warriors, workers, and those who cannot afford to live in acceptable conditions."

 JOM_tyr_chosen: "Tyr's Chosen"
 JOM_tyr_chosen_desc: "Our warriors march under the blessing of Tyr himself, the god of war. With such divine favour upon them, they shall stand unbroken against the greatest beasts the land of the Wends can summon. No fang nor steel shall shake their shield-wall. Their hearts beat to the rhythm of old sagas, and their blades carry the weight of righteous fury. Let the enemy send giants, let the earth split and roar - the sons of the North shall not yield. They fight not only for victory, but for glory, for memory, and for the eternal place in Valhalla."

 JOM_fury_of_berserkers: "Fury of the Berserkers"
 JOM_fury_of_berserkers_desc: "When Thor called them to battle, they did not hesitate. For them, honour was victory, and nothing held meaning but the spilled blood of foes and the pride of their shield-brothers, who fought not for gold nor glory, but to live free beneath open skies.\n\nAnd when darkness fell upon the earth, when silence crept among the cold and still forms of the fallen, they knelt. With bloodied hands and weary breath, they gave thanks to the gods, for sacred might, for unyielding spirit, and for the strength to stand while others fell. Their song was not of sorrow; it was for struggle, for survival, for the fire that burned within them still."

 JOM_forging_spears: "Forging the Spears and Axes"
 JOM_forging_spears_desc: "Our strongest berserkers could rip a Wend apart with their bare hands, as wolves tear flesh from a bone. But not all warriors carry such fury in their veins. Many still need steel - not for fear, but for honour, for the joy of battle, and for the weight of a blade in hand.\n\nThe forges of the old world are cold and lifeless, and not many factories remain to feed our Viking might. So we turn to the ways of our ancestors. In the smoke of village smithies, beneath hammers and fire, we shall shape our weapons anew, axeheads from scrap, and blades from iron."

 JOM_shields_from_vendland: "Shieldmaidens of Vendland"
 JOM_shields_from_vendland_desc: "Our shieldmaidens stand equal to the fiercest berserkers. With fire in their hearts and steel in their hands, they fight with the same unyielding courage and grim resolve as any warrior of the North. The gods see no difference in blood spilled for honour, and neither shall we.\n\nNo one should question their place. They have earned the right to stand in the shieldwall, to swing axe and sword, and to carve their path to Valhalla with fury and pride. The shieldbearers, our daughters, sisters, and mothers, shall be the unshaken backbone of our war effort. In battle, they are not women. They are wolves. "

 JOM_shield_wall_perfected: "Shield Wall Perfected"
 JOM_shield_wall_perfected_desc: "The shield wall doctrine, used in every battle, is highly effective. However, a modern adaptation could enhance our war efforts to the point where every man and woman in Pomerania would fear our horns and thirst for battle. By refining our tactics and adapting them for the modern battlefield, we can unleash a war machine that is rooted in tradition yet sharpened by necessity. Mastery on the battlefield will not only lead us to victory but also make Odin and the other gods proud. Dying in battle is the greatest honor, but fighting for our future and our offspring is the sacred duty that binds us to both our past and our destiny."

 JOM_cutting_trees_for_fleet_desc: "Along the western shores of Pomerania lie vast, ancient forests - deep and sacred, but their time has come. If we are to raise the great fleet we swore to the gods and our ancestors, the trees must fall. There can be no mercy, only axe and flame.\n\nOne hundred drakkars were promised - longships to carry us across the waters, back to the land of Western Pomerania. To reclaim and fulfil the saga written in our blood and history. The forests shall feed the forges, the shipyards shall thunder with toil, and from the roots of Midgard itself shall rise the legendary fleet that would make the Gods proud. "

 JOM_hit_run_doctrine: "Hit-and-Run Raids Doctrine"
 JOM_hit_run_doctrine_desc: "The strength of our kin has always been in the storm we bring - sudden, fierce, and gone before the dust can settle. We strike like thunder from a clear sky, with no warning, no mercy. One moment, the land is quiet; the next, the clash of steel, the roar of warriors, and fire licking the heavens.\n\nWe raid swiftly and vanish even swifter. While our foes scramble to understand what has happened, we are far away, sails full, laughing with the wind. And when they think they are safe again... we return, in another place, at another time, with the same fury."

 JOM_riverine_warfare: "Riverine Warfare"
 JOM_riverine_warfare_desc: "Langskips of every kind were crafted with such fierce brilliance that they could sail not only the vast, raging seas, but even reach the gods-forsaken shores of far-off Vinland, and glide just as easily through narrow fjords and winding rivers. Their hulls were built for both ocean wrath and inland cunning.\n\nThe Baltic lies behind us now, its waves conquered and forgotten. But ahead... ahead lies a land split by rivers, winding like serpents through the heart of our destiny. And just as before, our longships shall bear us forward, swift and silent, as axes bear down upon the necks of kings."

 JOM_fjm_karl_marx: "FJM Karl Marx"
 JOM_fjm_karl_marx_desc: "Our warband stands strong, an unbroken host of mighty Vikings, ready to seize the winding rivers of Pomerania with our fleet of proud drakkars. However, we are missing something. A longship worthy of sagas yet to be sung, leading our fleet like Fenrir at the head of the storm. We shall forge a vessel the likes of which Midgard has never seen, the mightiest drakkar ever carved from timber and iron. Named after the biggest advocate of basic workers' rights, Karl Marx, the vessel will make even Tyr himself proud. Let the rivers tremble beneath its keel."

 JOM_friggs_care: "Frigg's Care"
 JOM_friggs_care_desc: "Those who can no longer lift an axe or a shield shall never be cast aside. They are the hearth-keepers, the wisdom-bearers - the backbone of our tribe. It is they who raise the next generation of shieldmaidens and berserkers, who keep the fires burning when the warband marches to distant shores.\n\nLet none forget their sacrifice, for it is written in both scar and deed. And may Frigg, wise and gentle, bless them with strength and peace, so that when the horns fall silent and the swords are sheathed, we have a home worthy of our triumphs, and a people still standing to welcome us back."

 JOM_redistribute_loot: "Redistribution of Loot"
 JOM_redistribute_loot_desc: "The spoils of battle are not only for the Jarls. What our warriors seize with axe and fire must be shared with the folk. Let every man, woman, and child taste the fruits of our raids. When gold flows to all, no quarrels arise over how it was won. Thus, we stay strong, bound by blood, honour, and shared purpose. A true Viking victory is not measured by what one man takes, but by the feasting of the whole clan. Our strength is not only in the fury of the berserker, but in the bond of the shield wall and the unity of our people. That is how we shall endure."

 JOM_of_fish_and_mead: "Of Fish and Mead"
 JOM_of_fish_and_mead_desc: "The Viking diet was simple and harsh, shaped by the cold lands and the struggle to grow crops in the stony soil of the North.\n\nNow, we find ourselves in a similar plight. Until better days come, until the next harvest season, we must endure as our ancestors did: living off the fish of the sea, the honey from our hives, and whatever roots, berries, or wild herbs we can gather.\n\nIt may not be a feast fit for the gods, but it shall be enough to keep us strong, proud, and ready for the battles ahead."

 JOM_free_thralls: "Free the Thralls"
 JOM_free_thralls_desc: "The Vikings of old held an ambivalent view of slavery... but we shall not bear such a stain. Though we wear the furs and wield the axes of our ancestors, we care about the oppressed. We are not conquerors alone; we are a liberation army.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must march upon the reeducation camps across the former lands of the Eurokommissariats. We shall break their gates, tear down their fences, and set free every soul within. Political prisoners, forced laborers, and all those chained by the German yoke shall walk free again."

 JOM_power_of_njordr: "Power of Njörðr"
 JOM_power_of_njordr_desc: "Njörðr, warden of wind and wave, shall be the one to whom we offer our toil. As he calms storms and guides ships to safe shores, so too shall he guide our hands as we harness the breath of the sea and the song of the skies.\n\nLet the windmills turn in his name, and the waters flow with his blessing. May his favor bring us warmth in the frostbitten dark and light in the long winter nights. In his might, we shall not burn forests nor dig deep into the bones of the earth, but rise with the power of nature itself, as true sons and daughters of the North."

 JOM_establish_trades_routes: "Establish the Sea Trade Routes"
 JOM_establish_trades_routes_desc: "The sea is a gift from the gods, and it offers us more than just an escape from the madness ashore. Aye, we could raise our sails and vanish into the horizon, leaving the land of the Wends behind in smoke and ruin, but there is greater glory to achieve.\n\nWith wind at our backs and Njordr's blessing, we shall begin to trade, modest at first - small ships, scattered goods. But in time, our voyages shall become the sole lifeline between the world and this shattered coast. Then it will be we who name the price. Riches shall flow to those bold enough to brave the waves, and no one braves them like the sons and daughters of the North."

 JOM_great_serpent: "The Great Serpent Jörmungandr"
 JOM_great_serpent_desc: "The great serpent Jormungandr, wearing the guise of chieftain Tusk, coils himself around our native land, seeking to strangle all sparks of defiance that rise against him and his hordes.\nHis venom has poisoned all life in these lands, and his fangs have pierced through the very sinews of a once-proud people, binding them in an iron grip.\n\nFor all his wicked deeds - for the injustice dealt to our chieftain Sandbjerg and to our kin - he shall pay. And payment shall be in blood, for he is a merchant of slaughter, a peddler of ruin. So shall justice be done, when the villain tastes the edge of his own blade. And we - we shall strike the head from the invading beast, ending this age of terror.\n\nFreedom gained from this malicious wyrm shall be sweeter than the best meads."

 JOM_heartless_liberals_desc: "You - who bore banners of liberation,\nYou - who cloaked their true faces and slithered through the shadows, as cunning as the Trickster himself.\nYou deceived the folk who saw in you salvation, counting on the arm of justice to never reach you, sheltered by the might of the Southerner hordes.\n\nBut now we - we bring judgment. We accuse you of betraying the gods, \nOf betraying all that we hold dear, of betraying your own blood and name.\nLoki himself would call you kin.\nBut the people - they will not forget.\nAnd we... we shall let them pass their sentence.\nFor the law we fight for must bear teeth -\nAnd all who turned their eyes from wickedness shall suffer.\nAnd those who gave the orders...\n\nThere can be only one verdict."

 JOM_convert_settlers: "Conversions of the Settlers"
 JOM_convert_settlers_desc: "You were summoned not to preserve, but to break - to shatter what once stood here,\nTo reclaim what your forebears lost, to raise a new world from the ruins of the old.\nYou are victims of the zeitgeist, burdened with the weight of choices made far from these shores. But you must not yield to this cruel turning of fate.\n\nYou are our Germanic brothers.\nAwake!\nAwake - and remember your roots, reaching deep into the foundations of Yggdrasil.\nLook inward, to the soul within, and hear the voice of the Allfather!\nIn this dreadful storm, do you not hear Thor striking his anvil?\nDo you not feel the grace of Frigg when your thoughts turn to kin and hearth?\n\nThere is still hope for your redemption. Join us.\nReclaim the legacy of your true ancestors - and Midgard shall be made whole once more. Together."

 JOM_blood_eagle_traitors_desc: "From the great eyrie of eagles you claim your line. Upon your banners soared the eagle.\nAnd behind its wings you hid your cruelties. Wielding it as shield and spear alike.\nThat single symbol was to bend the people's knee, to force the land itself to bow to your will.\nBut you bled the eagle dry, and cursed it to wear a cloak of shame for all eternity.\n\nSo shall your fate be the eagle's. The blood-eagle.\n\nThere can be no mercy for those who sold their kin into chains, all for the pale illusion of power. No skald shall sing your name. No mother shall speak of you but to warn her child.\nAnd the gods shall never again let you cross the gates of Valhalla."

 JOM_burstaborg_siege_desc: "At the mouth of the Oder stands a stone-born monstrosity, named Szczecin by men.\nWithin the walls of this giant dwells hoarded treasure, piled high by the greedy hands of the outlaws from Hansa. How many swords and axes, how many winters' worth of bread could be bought with such a mountain of gold?\n\nNot even the dwarves of legend matched the lust of the bankers and merchants who bartered souls for silver in this cursed place. To seize this hold is no mere raid - It is the turning of the tide, a blow that grants us the river's heart and carves open the veins of Wendia. But the gold...the gold cries louder than the river itself. For our folk await not just conquest, but justice. And justice weighs its scales in coin and flame alike."

 JOM_summer_gone: "Summer is Ending"
 JOM_summer_gone_desc: "Not all that glitters is gold, and not all born in Szczecin are sold. In the bowels of that stony giant, dwell some who still follow the red northern star - that old sign of freedom, equality, and brotherhood, carried southward by the Summer Union.\n\nAmong their ranks walk many who might yet stand beside us, shoulder to shoulder. They served a false tyrant, but not by choice. Now we offer them that freedom: To cast down hollow idols and embrace the truth that Allfather Odin whispers to all who dare listen with open hearts.\n\nIt will take many moons, and the Oder will run long before they earn the right to be called sons and daughters of the North. But should their will prove pure, clear as glacial spring - then our hearths shall open, and our kin shall call them family."

 JOM_sack_the_city: "§RSACK THE CITY§!"
 JOM_sack_the_city_desc: "There is no scent sweeter than that of a burning city at dawn. This... this is what justice smells like. Too much gold has been hoarded in the coffers of the mighty lords of Szczecin for our warriors to pass by in silence. Behind their walls lie many homes - and in them, the innocent. The gods have forbidden us from touching them. Vengeance must be reserved for those who poisoned this land with their decaying creed, for those who fattened their bellies on the backs of the weary.\n\nWhen the day is done, a crimson glow will rise over Burstaborg, and the guilty shall drown in their own blood. Yet the morning that follows - that sacred dawn - shall bring rebirth.\nAnd with it, a purging fire to cleanse us all from the mistakes of the past."

 JOM_steel_longships: "Steel Longships from the Shipyards"
 JOM_steel_longships_desc: "Our dragon-ships, which carried us across the shadowed sea, are no mere vessels - they are the will of the gods made manifest. Thor, in his thunderous glory, and Njordr, lord of winds and tides, guided us to this shore, that we may fulfill our fate.\nYet in the heart of the city - in Burstaborg - lies a gift far greater than even the most faithful skald could dream:\n\nForges. Colossal forges that spew forth iron beasts. Forges that could build ships to sail not just the sea - but the Nine Realms themselves! We must awaken their fire again, stoke the flame beneath their ancient hearths. For only Odin knows what monstrous marvels our master-smiths shall forge. And the metal they shape - by sweat, by blood, by prayer - shall endure even the wrath of Surtr himself."

Its harbors and shipyards are the key to forging a fleet worthy of our ambitions, a fleet that will secure our dominance across the Baltic.\n\nBut there is more at stake than ships and salt winds. The cursed sons of Germania may yet seek to crawl back to these shores like wretched draugar. That cannot be allowed. By Odin's will, this land shall never again bow to foreign rule.\n\nNot all is lost to treachery; the red banners still fly over the city.

They come forth, heads bowed, ready to cast aside old, hollow dogmas and embrace the righteous Nordic path.

Those who choose to fight will earn their place in the sagas, while those who pay will still serve our cause.

The holmgang, a traditional duel, between Jarl Halfdan and Jabłonowski will occur soon. It is said that Jaszczur faces this challenge without fear, preparing for the fight with a smile.

Our men dread those cursed forests, for there is no shield wall, no war cry, only silence, traps, and death lurking behind.

Those who emerge from the shadowed forests, bloodied but unbroken, shall earn glory beyond measure. The weak will fall, while the worthy shall rise. What emerges from these cursed woods will not be an ordinary raider, but a hardened champion of Odin, a chosen of Tyr, blessed by Freyja's gaze.

We will move the herds, build longhouses of stone and timber, and till the soil with the strength of many warriors.

As they are our northern kin, there should be no obstacle in reaching an understanding. In truth, their commander, Chieftain Hellebjerg, holds little love for the chains of UN central command. He yearns for freedom, a warrior's freedom, to act without hesitation, without foreign whispers dulling his axe.\n\nLet the blue helmets gleam with the fury of the old gods. Let their swords strike not for treaties, but for honour and brotherhood.

And we must seize this moment.\n\n We shall extract all that is useful from this so-called humanitarian mission. Let the United Nations grumble and gnash their teeth; their distant fury matters little compared to the steel and supplies we can gain on the ground.

Grand ceremonies will blaze like the fires of Muspelheim, with festivals roaring to the beat of war drums, and joyous feasts celebrating the endless victories carved into our fate.

A hall brighter than the sun, the fairest haven in all Midgard, where only the just may dwell, a place that endures beyond earth and sky alike.\n\nSuch shall be our Jomsborg. Our Wendland. Our home.

Not Halfdan Sandbjerg. We did not bleed and struggle for one man's crown, but for freedom, for equality, for justice. For the dignity of all folk, in the spirit of northern socialism. Rough-hewn as we are, still it is these ideals that guide us.\n\nSo the time has come for a second Althing. A time to decide the fate and the shape of our new yet old home.

They are particularly excluded from the labour market because of motherhood or simply their reproductive age.\n\nBut not today. Not in Jomsborg. Not when we stand together.

It is time to end that hypocrisy. The black market in drug trade cannot be allowed to exist here and will be destroyed with the full force available to the state.\n\nAt the same time, we will introduce a rational drug policy based on support for recovery from addiction instead of jailing people and subjecting them to social stigma. We will grant amnesty to those convicted for possessing small amounts of substances for personal use. That will ensure that those who become victims receive support.

What matters is not how one walks, but whether their hands build rather than destroy, whether they stand by their kin when the storms howl loudest.\n\nSome warriors - hard of heart and quick to wrath - may scoff at such mercy. But only because they have not listened to the deeper verses of the sagas. It is the duty of a wise chieftain to open their eyes - not with blade, but with truth. We cannot demand that all love alike, nor force the heart to change. But if we turn from division, and instead stand side by side in our reverence for the gods, then there shall be no need for laws, no cause for quarrel.\n\nOnly kinship."

Equality forged in fire, not parchment. It is the way of the world - as it was, as it should be.\n\nElse, we stoke the fire of false war between the sexes, kindled by those who profit from division. Some speak to young women of flawless beauty, of waiting for princes, of golden chains dressed as gifts. They lie. A woman need not wait.

Some herbs, some sacred fungi, spring from the hands of the gods themselves. They are offerings - tools, not toys. Blessings to be used with reverence. These gifts must not fall into the hands of fools or gluttons. They belong to those chosen - to our priests who walk the misted paths of spirit, and to our warriors who must see beyond the veil in the heat of battle.\n\nFor such substances do not only harden the sinew and awaken the blood - they open the eye of the soul.

But it is the chieftain who shall name them. For only he knows how true balance is struck. Only he sees the full weave of the fates. Matters of men, though heavy, are lighter than those of gods. And thus the chosen shall speak and rule on them - with power, with voice, with will.\n\nBut let none among them dare reach for the highest bough. Let none think to decide what is reserved for the hand of the one. For only the chieftain can shape divine will into law. Only he can make equality march beneath the banner of its greatest servant."

 JOM_drottnars_of_new_midgard_desc: "To forge a new realm, fresh blood must flow - not upon the stones of battle, but into the veins of power. Odin alone knows: none strive harder than the comrades of the party. None shout louder their oaths. Yet even so, more and more reveal they do not see the destiny Halfdan sees. They do not hear the whisper of the Norns as they weave his fate. They do not feel the pull of glory in his footsteps.\n\nThus, the circle around the chieftain must change. One cannot allow shadows to dim the path of fire. None may turn him from his course. The gods have spoken: After Ragnarök, there shall be paradise. And only those who would give their last breath to see it born - only they are worthy to sit at the chieftain's right hand."

 JOM_herald_of_change_desc: "The Chieftain knows what is to come. He is the coming. The Chieftain knows how to make Wendia whole again. He shall lead us to freedom. To equality. To brotherhood. Only with the Chieftain shall we grasp true socialism. And in the process - we shall pillage all enemies of the flame. The gods speak through him. He is their voice. Their thunder. He brings the Revolution. He shall grind the rotted order to dust, and from its ashes, raise a paradise the skalds will sing of.\n\nOnly he knows the way, for Odin himself poured wisdom into his spirit. When the sky above Wendia grows dark, let all men and beasts know: the wrath of the northern gods draws near. None shall be spared by the turning. All shall be judged. All shall receive what they are due: eternal torment in Hel's cold grasp - or a life of plenty in golden Midgard."

Persons appointed by the loathsome Eurofederation government may expect instant dismissal, and even trial before the courts!\nDown with cronyism, down with corruption, down with favoritism!\nBefore us stands the challenge of building a new, just order, founded on the true participation of citizens.\nYet already various concepts of renewal begin to emerge...

From now on, the vast majority of all resources shall be directed straight to services for the citizens.\nWork shall be available to all, yet there shall be no place for exploitation, but for strong trade unions!\nThis and still more!"

 JOM_progressive_tax_scale: "Progressive Tax Scale"
 JOM_progressive_tax_scale_desc: "Oppression and exploitation. That is what the pre-collapse state offered its workers. While the big fish grew rich at the expense of the lower classes, bloody revolutions were born. But here, we cannot allow lynch justice - we bring a solution. Honest working people will finally pay less in taxes than millionaires living off the labor of others. No longer will they flee to tax havens to avoid paying contributions, no longer will they enjoy the privilege of a flat tax.\n\nA progressive tax is only natural. It cannot be that a giant corporation and a small business pay the same. Justice must be guaranteed. And the schemers and tricksters who try to dodge this solidarity will be caught. You no longer need to glare angrily at your employers. We will do it for you."

 JOM_found_welfare_state_desc: "Back in the days of PiS, certain steps were taken toward a welfare state, and we cannot deny them that. Yet they were shamelessly exploited as party propaganda, not truly aimed at improving citizens' lives. We have a broad program to implement - one that will put us on the path to becoming a welfare state in every possible sense of the term.\n\nWe will raise the income threshold for access to family benefits, build care homes for seniors and those in need of support in every commune, simplify procedures for obtaining benefits, guarantee places in nurseries and kindergartens for all children, introduce universal child-raising allowances, and establish a unified parental leave system.\n\nThat is only the beginning. And after that - we expand the program. And we grow. So that life is better for everyone."

 JOM_jarl_commonwealth: "Commonwealth of Jarls"
 JOM_jarl_commonwealth_desc: "The Althing alone is chaos. Too wild, too open to the tides of emotion and ambition. Thus, we must forge a second pillar - an upper chamber of steel and stone, drawn from the ranks of the jarls, the lords of the land, the wardens of the hearth and shield-wall. Together, these two chambers shall keep one another in check. But more importantly - they shall guard the Warchief. Any soul bold enough to dream of limiting Halfdan's mandate will now face not only the voice of the commons...but the Commonwealth of Jarls, rooted in oaths, bloodlines, and flame-tempered loyalty. It is a cunning gift - a taste of power for the local rulers, a seat at the table, a whisper in the great hall where fates are sealed.\n\nBut let no one be fooled: they speak, they vote, they rule - yet only one commands.\nAnd his name is Halfdan Sandbjerg."

 JOM_danegeld_from_rich: "Danegeld from the Rich"
 JOM_danegeld_from_rich_desc: "We will not grovel in courts built by thieves. We will not argue with those who drank from the skulls of the poor. We shall smash them. Plain and simple. Take from the rich. Give to the poor. A truth older than thrones, older than kings, as righteous as the first fire of mankind. All those whose hoarded gold rises above what any one hand should hold - they shall be taxed, stripped, and broken. They grew fat on the labor of the common folk. Their fortunes swelled like tumors, and with their coin, their pride grew bloated, until they dared walk like gods among mortals.\n\nAnd the people? The people starved. They burned. They remembered. Now the storm rises. The axe thirsts. Every common man knows his sacred task: to rise, to strike, to make the oppressor answer for every scar, every stolen year. The age of the gold is over. Let them submit. Or let them feel the blade."

 JOM_guardians_of_equality: "Guardians of the Equality"
 JOM_guardians_of_equality_desc: "There are still those in our land who dare to exploit, who seek to grow fat at the expense of others. There are still those who belittle their brothers to feed their own pride - who step on the necks of the humble to rise above them. Such acts shall be met with judgment. And such judgment shall be swift. Only when the last whisper of domination is silenced shall all people walk unburdened in our new world - a world forged not by mercy for the wicked, but by loyalty to justice.\n\nWe will raise a band - a Guardians of Equality - tasked with defending the spoils of justice, watching over the reborn realm, and acting without hesitation wherever inequality, exploitation, or cruelty take root. Yes - sometimes with force. For examples must be made. Even harsh ones. And do not mistake it for vengeance - it is the will of the gods. For the gods themselves teach us: Give drink to the thirsty, food to the starving, and hang the exploiters high from the old oaks."

While some see our leader as a liberator, and others regard him as a steadfast hero of righteousness, one thing is clear: he represents something significant to us all. This is a land where freedom flourishes for those who embrace virtue and honor the principles that guide our society. \n\nWe dream of a shared table, a place where people from all walks of life can gather as equals, celebrating our differences while cherishing our common humanity. This dream is not just a distant fantasy; it is a vision that can become a reality! Together, let us nurture this dream, ensuring that it becomes a vivid tapestry of unity and understanding. In our hearts, we hold the belief that in this land, undefined by the challenges we face, we can create a future where hope and dreams shine brightly for everyone."

 JOM_valor_of_boar: "Valor of the Boar"
 JOM_valor_of_boar_desc: "Laying the foundations of our nation is a profound endeavor, one that transcends mere structures and policies. It calls for the essence of culture-our religion, our identity, the very fabric that weaves together who we are and what we hold dear. As we gaze towards the future, we must first cultivate a robust foundation upon which our collective dreams can flourish: the culture in which we will thrive and grow.\n\nYet, amidst this noble pursuit, we find ourselves at a crossroads, with opinions sharply divided and hearts yearning for clarity. The challenge lies not just in building, but in discerning whose path we should follow-a task that weighs heavily on the conscience of our society.\n\nIn this sentiment-laden journey, we must remember that our choices today will echo through generations to come. Let us embrace the undefined possibilities ahead, allowing our shared values and beliefs to guide us in crafting a future where every voice is heard, every culture respected, and every heart united in purpose. Together, we can weave a narrative that honors our past while boldly stepping into the promise of tomorrow."

 JOM_identity_problems_desc: "Who are we? Or perhaps more poignantly, who were we? As we traverse the path of our existence, the questions of identity and purpose weigh heavily on our minds. The journey to the past is a tough nut to crack. We trace our roots back to Denmark, where the fierce spirit of the Vikings runs through our veins, yet we stand proudly as Poles. These two heritages embody seemingly contradictory values, much like the elemental clash of fire and water.\n\nIn the face of such duality, we find ourselves at a crossroads, compelled to make a choice. It is within this intricate dance of culture and legacy that we seek to draw forth the best from each side. The allure of the Nordic spirit beckons to us, whispering tales of strength and resilience. But is that truly the essence of who we are?"

However, let us not overlook the profound influence of Nordic values that can enrich our Polish identity. Values such as trust, humanity, innovation, and openness have much to offer us in our quest for a brighter future.\n\nBy embracing these Nordic ideals, we can foster a society that thrives on cooperation and creativity, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for future generations. It is crucial that we recognize the potential in blending our rich heritage with these progressive principles. Together, we can create a Poland that honors its past while boldly stepping into the future. \n\nLet us stand united, championing both our Polish heritage and the invaluable lessons from the Nordic world. The combination of our unique cultural identity with these universal values can empower us to build a better, more inclusive home for all. So, let's commit to this vision and ensure that we pave the way for generations to come."

 JOM_to_free_fatherland: "To free our fatherland from chains..."
 JOM_to_free_fatherland_desc: "Who declared that only the right wing holds the monopoly on patriotism? Sadly, today's left has strayed into the realm of cosmopolitanism and pro-Europeanism, discarding patriotism like an unwelcome piece of gum stuck to the sole of a shoe. A compelling case for reconsideration can be found in the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) during the Second Polish Republic. This party boasted some of the most prominent and remarkable figures, including Marshal Józef Piłsudski and Prime Minister Ignacy Daszyński. Did their socialist beliefs inhibit them from passionately loving their homeland and valiantly defending it during its most challenging times? This is the essence of what true leftism embodies-an unyielding spirit of revolution intertwined with deep-rooted patriotism.\n\nWe must rally together for the sake of a better homeland! It is time for a resurgence of a left that proudly embraces its national identity while championing progressive ideals. The time has come to redefine what it means to be patriotic in a way that includes all who genuinely care for their country, regardless of their political affiliations. Together, we can forge a path that honors both our revolutionary spirit and our love for the land we call home."

This insidious poison has seeped into our nation, threatening the very essence of what we hold dear - our homeland, a land we have cherished and fought for with unwavering resolve. Abandoning our birthplace is simply unimaginable; it is a profound injustice to harbor hatred towards the land that has shaped our identities.\n\nDo you still remember our national anthem? Like the courageous Stefan Czarniecki, who returned to reclaim his homeland in 1658, again we will rise and conquer this nightmare that seeks to divide us. His indomitable spirit has been our guiding light from the outset of our struggle. Let it resonate in our hearts and minds: Wendia has not yet perished!\n\nTogether, we must rally as one, igniting a fierce love for our country that transcends fear and division. Let us be inspired by our shared history and the strength of our unity. The journey ahead may be challenging, but with determination and hope, we will forge a brighter future for ourselves and generations to come. We are the heartbeat of this nation, and we will not let it falter!"

 JOM_foundation_myths_desc: "Mieszko the First was a Viking - or so one legend whispers through the mists of time. But if it is true, it changes everything. Not just our past. Our purpose. To us, it is more than theory. It is creed. All Poles are born of Vikings. The Polish state was forged in the northern spirit. We are heirs of Odin's blood - but also founders of the very realm we now claim as ours by right.\nThis is our legacy.\nThis is our birthright.\nAnd it must be seized with the full strength of our conviction. But that task will be easier if all others believe what we know in our bones: that we are not strangers from afar - but long-lost kin returning home."

 JOM_nordic_roots: "Nordic Roots"
 JOM_nordic_roots_desc: "Not Mieszko alone. Świętosława - daughter of Mieszko - was none other than the legendary Sigrid the Haughty, queen to Sweyn Forkbeard, mother to Cnut the Great, ruler of the North Sea Empire. The daughter of Bolesław the Wrymouth ruled in Sweden. So did Katarzyna Jagiellonka. The House of Vasa bore crown and scepter both in Poland and the North. And our own chieftain? He was born on Danish soil.\n\nThe pattern is clear - example upon example, root upon root - the fate of the Wends is knotted deep within the saga of the northern tribes. We must reclaim that truth, not bury it. We belong to the great tree of history, and the hour has come to bind its branches once more under the banner of the raven and the watchful eye of the Allfather. Only in the memory of our ancestors can we raise a future worth forging. Only in their traditions and triumphs can we anchor our destiny.

 JOM_jomsborg_identity_desc: "We were Poles. But what we are now...was forged in years of exile and the fire of a spiritual journey. The culture has changed. The Nordic blood that pulses in our veins cries out - for separation from the rot at the heart of the Polish identity. Let us preserve what was noble. But from its shattered shell, let us birth something new. Modern ideals stand like iron gates, blocking the path back to the ancient truths of the folk soul. Chains clasped on us by the capitalist order rot the spirit from within - till men forget who they are, and what they stand for, all for silver and smoke.\n\nLet the northern wind cleanse our people. And from the hardship of the Norse and the endurance of the Polish shall rise a fusion destined to rule all nine worlds.\nTogether - we shall have everything."

 JOM_norse_language: "New Norse Language"
 JOM_norse_language_desc: "We have forgotten how to speak with the gods. We have forgotten the common bloodline that once let all Vikings understand one another. The tongue of the true Nords has been bastardized - twisted and diluted by the modern nations of Scandinavia. All save for Iceland and the Faroe Islands, where sacred isolation preserved the spirit of Old Norse like an ember in snow. From their language - and the ancient runes - we must revive what was lost. We must reforge the divine tongue. Let it rise again as New Norse. A voice carved in ice and thunder- the sound of unity, of ancestry, of the Old Gods returning.\n\nAnd Polish? Too convoluted. Too cut off from the gods. Too distant. Let them speak it, if they must - but soon they shall see: that tongue bears only conflict and shadows. It carries the weight of a fractured past. We offer them something more. "

We reckon with it fairly - we have our own heroes, but we do not dismiss the achievements of others like Dmowski or Paderewski. It was the left that built the foundations of this country after the years of partition, and it will be the left that does so once again!\n\nIt is upon our shoulders that the responsibility for the future of this nation and state now rests. The spiteful may say that since we lean so far into patriotism, mathematically it must add up to national socialism. Nothing could be further from the truth. Patriotism, not nationalism. We take patriotic behavior and values and integrate them with the left's. This is not difficult, nor is it at all incompatible.\n\nAt last."

Many times, history has witnessed the artificial forging of nations - patched together with lies or force, crumbling under the weight of their own absurdity. But this... this is different. This is a natural synthesis. The awakening of a primal fragment within us all - an elemental truth glimpsed only by those brave enough to peer deep into the human soul, beyond lineage, beyond ancestry.\n\nTo be Jomswend is not to be born - it is to become. A creation so pure, so precise, that it calls out to those lost in the fog of modernity. It is a new pantheon - Nordic in essence, modern in unity - where belonging is forged not by geography, but by belief. Belief in the ideals. Loyalty to the community. Readiness to defend it - against the rot from beyond.\nYou are not Jomswend because your parents were.\nYou are Jomswend because you choose to be."

Spiritual seeking is not evil; our world has no place for prejudice, not even toward one's creed. So long as no one forces belief upon another - a scourge all too common in the age before the fall.\n\nRightly, we cast off the yoke of the Vatican. We end the impunity of priests who turned this land into their private manor, gorging themselves upon indulgence and vice. But the spirit of a person can still be shaped.

Of course, voluntary donations may continue to exist, but the Catholic Church must be separated from the state system.\n\nNot a penny more. No more special treatment, no more impunity, no more hiding behind the state's robes. No more empires of priests who, driven by greed, build great temples to their own egos. We want no "fathers-directors" here. The Protestants were right when they spoke of the Catholic Church's ostentatious display of wealth.

This cannot be reconciled with the secular character of our state; it only creates divisions within society and fuels polarization, and students do not wish to attend those classes in any case. All academic and educational activity should be free from any religious influence that might carry even traces of promoting a particular denomination. Research on religions is permissible, but only in a way that leaves no doubt it is education about religions, not a hidden process of indoctrination.\n\nReligion cannot stand in the way of science, especially through the proclamation of negationist theses that contradict the current, widely accepted state of scientific knowledge. This is unacceptable and may be treated as the dissemination of false content by organizations which, after all, are recognized as ordinary non-governmental institutions and subject to the same laws as they are."

More and more people are officially declaring what they had long thought - the desire to renounce the Catholic Church. And what is more, they are proud of it. True, we have never spoken officially about such a thing, and so this is a strictly grassroots phenomenon... but it works in our favor. People have opened their eyes and seen the hypocrisy that guides the church. Together, we will be able to bring about great changes in worldview...\n\n...but the others, in turn... are becoming ever more radicalized, and soon, instead of a bloated, lazy, and powerless church, we may find ourselves facing the return of a fanatical and determined movement, ready for anything, whose goal will be to launch a crusade to reclaim the country for God.\n\nMay that day never come."

You call yourselves shepherds, but all you ever did was feed on the flock. You speak with false tongues on matters you neither understand nor have right to judge. You dictate thought, limit freedom, shackle will. You dare claim the voice of the One True God. But Odin said no such thing. The gods of old watch you from high halls - and they spit in your direction.\n\nTheir message is clear. Their wrath, stirring.\nFor every chain you placed upon us- you will pay in iron."

This is no superstition, no quaint tale buried by the march of capital and concrete. This is a living gift, a thread that ties spirit to spirit, allowing those chosen to gaze beyond skin and bone, into the very essence of a being - its energy, its aura, its pain. They read the signs etched in stone and soil, in the wind whispering through the branches, in the howls of beasts and the paths of stars. From these voices of nature, they learn of what was, what aches now, and what shadows or light lie ahead.\n\nThrough them, the gods speak.

But too often, these paths are poisoned - twisted by the far right, or emptied of meaning, turned into lifeless rituals with no soul behind them. Even the gods... Even Odin, Thor, Freyja - have been sold like cheap trinkets. Dragged into comic books, turned into mascots, stripped of mystery, turned into noise for the masses. Ask around - everyone's heard of the Vikings. Few believe they ever prayed, or bled, or wept for their gods as we do now. Few feel the sacred breath of the old ways still stirring in their chests.\n\nBut we do. And we must restore it. Not as an echo, but as a living, burning truth to be centralized, renewed, and carried across the world. Because the nordic spark lives in all of us - buried, maybe, but never gone. It is a truth born of nature, and it is time to awaken it."

And sure - our modern world may scoff at that. They call themselves too enlightened for symbols, too civilized for blood. But maybe... every now and then, a sheep must be offered. Or an enemy. A little ancient fire never hurt a society that's forgotten how to feel.\n\nAt first, they'll look at us like we're mad. But that will change. It always does. When they see that our path leads to victory, to order, to a future forged in unity and purpose, they'll understand: That what binds our people isn't just faith in the gods - but faith in the power all around us, and above all, in each other. Bound not by law or contract, but by blood, ritual, unbreakable brotherhood and friendship. Because friendship is magic."

A call that comes not from the mouths of men, but from deep within. Our faith speaks to them. Not through sermons or slogans, but through the pulse of the earth, the whisper of wind across stone, the roar of a storm that sounds like memory. They come to us in droves - tired of being owned, tired of kneeling to hollow men. They cast off their collars, and walk barefoot into the truth.\n\nIt's heartening. It's powerful. And - truth be told - it's more than we expected. We'll need more temples than we dared dream. More priests. More hands to guide, to build, to teach. Because this faith - our faith - is not a Sunday affair. It is not a habit. It is a people, a living force, a bond that stretches across blood, sky, and bone."

And the truth, harsh as Niflheim's wind, is this: without industry, we shall falter - left behind by neighbors more ruthless, more prepared. Yet beneath our feet lie the seeds. Hidden veins of artisanal tradition, subtle techniques, local craftworks that still glow with ancient spirit. We must fan those embers - let them burn bright again.\n\nTo build our industry is to shield our people. To forge arms is to forge security. Every hammer strike, every nail driven, every barrel sealed is not just for today - it is an offering to the future of Jomsborg. And every brick laid in our armament halls becomes a stone in the fortress that protects us all."

 JOM_state_earmarked_fund: "State Earmarked Fund"
 JOM_state_earmarked_fund_desc: "We will establish a dedicated state investment fund, managed by the National Development Bank, to lead the rebirth of Poland's industrial strength. That is not just policy, it is a declaration that we will rise from the wreckage with purpose and vision. The fund will finance the construction of new industrial facilities and bring to life the advanced technologies developed at our universities.\n\nBy uniting science with industry, we will spark a new era of innovation and restore dignity to work through the creation of thousands of high-quality jobs. In the ashes of collapse, we choose progress, which will ensure the well-being of ordinary citizens. "

 JOM_central_armaments_group: "Establish the Central Armaments Group"
 JOM_central_armaments_group_desc: "To secure the logistics of the Polish Armed Forces, we must reduce unplanned foreign acquisitions and reinvest in our domestic defense industry. Breaking our dependence on critical foreign components will be challenging, especially since Poland is one of the least technologically developed nations in Europe.\n\nThis issue extends beyond defense; it is fundamentally about sovereignty. Therefore, we advocate for investment decisions and appointments within state-owned enterprises to be guided by clear, strategic objectives rather than political loyalty.\n\nIf we aim to rebuild a strong, independent nation, we must create a defense sector that serves the people, not politicians. "

 JOM_rental_housing: "Rental Housing Construction Program"
 JOM_rental_housing_desc: "For too long, housing policy has prioritized banks and developers over people. We will work to rebuild a fair housing system. We will initiate a state rental housing program funded directly from the central budget to reduce prices and restore access to decent homes. There will be no more backdoor subsidies for corporate interests. We will halt the sell-off of municipal housing and invest significantly in renovating what remains, giving tenants real control over their buildings.\n\nAt the same time, we will empower residents by supporting housing cooperatives, breaking up large structures, and limiting leadership terms to prevent stagnation. Public land will be used to serve communities, not for private gain. "

 JOM_extincton_of_claims: "Extinction of Reprivatization Claims"
 JOM_extincton_of_claims_desc: "Extinguish reprivatization claims! This slogan has long been carried on our banners, for it is a prerogative of our government that no swindlers shall ever again be able to throw people out onto the street and leave them without a roof over their heads. At the same time, we must prohibit such evictions altogether, whether total or concerning premises unfit for habitation.\n\nIt cannot be that someone is thrown out because of the delusions of an owner. The pathology that has grown within the real estate system is poisonous to society and must be burned out at the roots, so that we can build a new, better, and above all healthier housing system for all citizens."

 JOM_grand_loot_treasury: "Grand Loot Treasury"
 JOM_grand_loot_treasury_desc: "Many spoils our warriors bring home from raids cannot be easily shared - too strange, too rare, or too intangible for fair division. Such treasures must find their way to the central hoard, not to amass idle wealth, but to stand as our shield in times of need. This is not gold for greed, but gold for storms. When hunger stalks the land or when a worthy cause calls - the treasury shall answer, for it belongs not to one, but to all.\n\nThe more you give, the fuller your bowl becomes. For in a true kinship, generosity returns thrice over - once from the gods, once from the folk, and once from the future."

 JOM_great_smithery_of_brokkr_desc: "Hammering swords and axes behind barns no longer serves our purpose. We must raise a forge worthy of the gods themselves - and if such a height is beyond us, then let us walk in the steps of the dwarves. Let Brokkr guide our anvils, let Eitri whisper to our flames, let Sindri bless each spark. By their example, we shall craft wonders for a new age - blades so sharp they could pierce the very roots of Yggdrasil. Armor that holds firm even against the fiercest fire of Muspelheim. Jewels whose brilliance shames the nine worlds.\n\nLet the fires roar. Let the anvils sing. We will awaken the old art anew - greater and brighter than ever before."

 JOM_hang_landlords: "Hang the Developers and Landlords"
 JOM_hang_landlords_desc: "We offered them our hand. Invited them to walk with us toward change. We built the best path we could - a bridge from the rot of the old world to something new, gentler, wiser. We believed kindness and hope would be enough to open their eyes. We were wrong.\n\nSome are beyond saving. Still they clung to their power, still they spread rot, smiling, scheming, feeding on the suffering of others. Now we see them clearly. The exploiters. The architects of poverty. They will be held to account - every last one. No mercy for the leeches. No future for the vipers who would slither into our new dawn only to poison it from within.\n\nThey had their chance.\nNow they are lost."

 JOM_dreams_of_silicon: "Dreams of Silicon and Steel"
 JOM_dreams_of_silicon_desc: "The old European order is gone. Treaties, rules, and illusions can no longer shield us from a world in turmoil. Germany is stagnating, and the continent is hesitant. Since the Fall, we have been left to fend for ourselves. It is high time for a change.\n\nGlobal supply chains are collapsing, and our dependence on them has become a serious threat. To weather what is coming, we must build an industrial core rooted in sovereignty, focusing on pharmaceuticals, metallurgy, and electronics. Jomsborg will be the capital of this new era, a city built on silicon and steel."

 JOM_a_steel_reality: "A Steel Reality"
 JOM_a_steel_reality_desc: "The truth is harsh: we cannot afford luxuries of technology, not now. Unity will not come from theories, nor from sacred atoms or whispering machines. It will come from steel - and steel we shall wield. It is faster. It is cheaper. It is certain. There will be time for miracles after victory. But until then, the land must function, and nothing cuts through confusion like the edge of a blade.\n\nGive us a drakkar, a loyal crew with axes in hand, a clear enemy on the horizon - and the world becomes black and white once more. Let others chase phantoms and forgotten relics. Let them waste their strength on the \"what ifs\". We know what works.\n\nThe time of fire and steel has begun."

 JOM_gifts_of_gefjun: "Gifts of Gefjun"
 JOM_gifts_of_gefjun_desc: "Before Midgard even had a name, its bountiful lands bore us fruit, root and lumber. The Goddess Gefjun is to be thanked for our wellbeing. Her pastures ever changing, ever adapting, ever malleable to our needs. She is a mother who cares for her sons, always ready to reward them for their work, for tending to her ever-expansive garden. There is nothing more that brings a smile to the face of a being so caring, than a wondrous collage crafted through just labor by her children, all of whom she'll reward with crop and bread."

 JOM_desist_tree_cutting: "Desist the Tree Cutting"
 JOM_desist_tree_cutting_desc: "Our native forests have already served the common cause enough. No more destruction of nature's sacred groves. The fleet of Jomsborg already inspires sufficient dread and terror among our enemies - let us not forget, it was thanks to them - to Polish trees! From their sacrifice we were able to so greatly expand our navy, yet now comes the time of change and of other priorities.\nMass reforestation must be begun without delay. All logging shall be immediately forbidden. The ecosystems demand deep renewal and regeneration - just as does our tormented nation..."

 JOM_transformation_from_ruins: "Transformation from the Ruins"
 JOM_transformation_from_ruins_desc: "Just as the fossilized and corrupt regime of the Euro-Commissariats has fallen, so too has the outdated energy system based on non-renewable sources collapsed with it. Fear not for access to electricity or heat, for this situation is for us a GREAT opportunity.\n Inefficient, and harmful both to human health and to the environment, fossil fuels must be replaced as swiftly as possible by renewable sources of energy. Citizens, let us look to the future - a future called: biogas, solar panels, wind turbines, and soon enough, atomic power!"

 JOM_plant_school: "Plant School"
 JOM_plant_school_desc: "'Plant School' is an initiative for a better tomorrow, one that focuses on the very essence of the future-our children!\nThe 'Razem' party officially and firmly supports its introduction.\nThe 'Plant School' program is about providing schools with healthy, local, high-quality food. Moreover, all products are to come from ecological and environmentally friendly sources.\nPractical workshops and nutrition education will also be implemented.\nFull support for its realization has been expressed by local governments and state institutions, which will help bring together groups of citizens.\nEveryone can feel like a beneficiary! This program is directed at all children-regardless of their status, wealth, and without unnecessary bureaucracy!"

 JOM_modernize_farms: "Begin the Healthcare System Reform"
 JOM_modernize_farms_desc: "'The privatization of healthcare is dangerous and means that millions of people will lose their right to treatment' - thus, our leader Adrian Zandberg recalls the criminal policy of the Euro-Commissariats...\nNever again can we allow such an unjust system to ignore the health of Poles. That is why the time for change has come:\n• modern and free treatment for all\n• greater funding for healthcare, including personnel\n• more residency places and greater availability of doctors\n• all schools shall receive free nursing care, dental care, and mandatory vaccinations, while all rural communes shall be provided with nursing care\n• mental health is just as important as physical health - we shall strengthen psychiatry, above all for children"

 JOM_more_wood_sire: "We Need More Wood, Sire"
 JOM_more_wood_sire_desc: "Before the ages of the Ironclad, the age of the Steamer and eventually the modern fleets of today, there was good, reliable lumber. There was no grander joy than to see the very tree chopped down transform into a great drakkar, primed for adventure to lands unknown. Yet wishes we may have, wishes like a child asking their mother for the newest, best toy... in return we receive forests, axes and the promise of greatness. So raise your axes, raise them high and march not for war, yet to make our mother Gefjun proud! Her gifts require work, and work we shall show her!"

 JOM_power_only_from_gods: "Power Comes Only From the Gods"
 JOM_power_only_from_gods_desc: "Power made of mortal hands is not true power. It is a mimicry that spits in the face of the gods that have deemed it kind to let its vestiges spill into Midgard. Njörðr, ever gazing outwards to the sea, grants us the crashing waves, the boisterous winds, the hearts and souls of our very adventures, yet for his great efforts we can show even greater appreciation - catching his wind not within our sails, but into great turbines, reaching out to the heavens from the seas. True monuments to his awe-inspiring might. Sól, the sun herself, allows us to bask in her glorious, comforting warmth. Her radiant glow, the brilliant spectacle of light, should be one without waste - what remains of the radiance will be cherished, harnessed with panels named in her honor."

 JOM_from_battle_to_farms: "From Battlefield to Farms"
 JOM_from_battle_to_farms_desc: "A noble thing indeed it is, when marching in the foremost rank, our valiant berserker fights unwearied. Blood and death about him, yet he strides toward victory!\nA noble thing indeed it is, when returning home, the berserker sits by the fjord, drawing forth fish. He tills the field, he tends the garden. From his labor the future shall be forged!\nO Jomsviking brothers, hear! The homeland praises the warriors. Yet the working folk are this soil's name. From the earth they rose, its salt and frame! When the axe is set aside, be clear. Your duty still remains the same: Through work, you build your people's name!"

 JOM_organic_food: "Organic Food Production System"
 JOM_organic_food_desc: "Reviving agriculture is crucial, but we need to shift towards ecological farming that nurtures the soil and utilizes natural fertilizers. This approach honors natural processes and avoids chemical inputs, which helps protect biodiversity and natural resources. Ecological farming fosters healthy ecosystems by maintaining soil fertility and promoting a diversity of plant and animal life. It also safeguards water, air, and land from pollution and depletion. By prioritizing sustainability over short-term profits, this method ensures that farming can be sustained for future generations. Embracing ecological agriculture means creating a balanced and resilient system that benefits both people and the environment."

 JOM_new_land_opportunities: "New Land Opportunities"
 JOM_new_land_opportunities_desc: "We have gained vast lands - territories whose former masters, for reasons too numerous or too grim to name, are no longer with us. And now, these lands must be put to purpose. Let the spoils be sown. A just redistribution of soil to our proven warriors will give them reason to fight - and a hearth to return to.\n\nTheir deeds in battle, their needs at home, will guide our hand as we grant them the earth's finest bounty: land to till, to tame, to treasure. There is no greater balm for a raider's weary soul than to come back to his kin, to his own land - to plant carrots in the quiet dusk after a season of blood and glory.\n\nSteel wins the day.\nBut soil wins the heart."

 JOM_industrial_light_of_northern_star: "Industrial Light of the Northern Star"
 JOM_industrial_light_of_northern_star_desc: "Our economy glows faintly still - but brighter with each passing day, like the polar star rising high over a winter night. Now is not the time to rest, nor to slip into hibernation awaiting the next call to arms. No - we must press forward, unyielding. The struggle for a healthy, just society is a flame that must never go out. With every careful investment, with every honest effort, we shape a future that leaves the broken ruins of this land behind.\n\nLet us be the example - a beacon in the vast darkness. Let us be the lighthouse that calls wandering ships to safe harbor. Let us stand together."

 JOM_til_valhall: "TIL VALHALL!"
 JOM_til_valhall_desc: "A measure of wisdom each man shall have,\nBut never too much let him know;\nFor the wise man's heart is seldom happy,\nIf wisdom too great he has won.\nA measure of wisdom each man shall have,\nBut never too much let him know; \nLet no man the fate before him see,\nFor so is he freest from sorrow.\nA brand from a brand is kindled and burned,\nAnd fire from fire begotten;\nAnd man by his speech is known to men,\nAnd the stupid by their stillness.\nHe must early go forth who fain the blood\nOr the goods of another would get;\nThe wolf that lies idle shall win little meat,\nOr the sleeping man success.\nHe must early go forth whose workers are few,\nHimself his work to seek;\nMuch remains undone for the morning-sleeper,\nFor the swift is wealth half won."

 JOM_a_new_viking_age_desc: "The past smiles not on the people of the north. Defeat at the hands of the Anglo-Saxons brought about the end of an era. An era of glory, of gold, mead and of splendorous feasts came crumbling down, all because of one cunning strategist. A snake in the body of a man. With humiliation wrought upon the north came the encroachment of a foreign God, strangling the souls and minds of once great warriors, shackling them and rendering them slaves.\n\nYet those days, those most glorious of days, may return once more! Hymns of spilled blood, of scarred bodies and of unparalleled treasures will be sung until the days of Ragnarök, and for one day more, ever after, so long as we live, even if our Gods fall. We will be the new wave of glorious plunder, as our predecessors once reigned! "

 JOM_deep_raids_into_enemy_territory_desc: "A weapon strikes true, looses blood in rivulets, pouring from the life-giving chambers its crimson ichor. A body rent with the blade of a weapon hurts most when struck in the heart. Such is the case also for the minds of those who we deem flowing with riches, primed for harvest. The corpus, deep beneath the ribs and away from our beloved naval home makes them complacent, makes them believe that they are safe. They grow soft within their inland holds, they don't bother with defending what they hold dear. We'll strike deep, between the ribs, between the folds of their brain to let loose fear. True fear."

He pushes us to and fro, up and down the rivers blue, through the waves afar. His daughters too, children of blue, they play and billow, happy to steer us. How can we deny them more tools and toys to enjoy? We are but tiny sailors, with little boats, all armed with little guns. Say, why not build more? A group of things small and insignificant can even be awe-inspiring, if built up enough. The seas will be thick with our ships, all together being more. Maybe even more than a Jötun."

Wondrous beings they are, guiding our fallen warriors to Odin's splendorous halls. Yet those ghostly dames may not help those who haven't yet slipped their final breath. We need valkyries of our own back within the plane of Midgard. Trained as the men amongst them, they will learn discipline, war, and most important above all, they will be taught medicine. They will swoop in amongst the turmoil of battle and save those on the brink, mend their ills and bring them back into safe hands."

When it comes time to drink and sing, an occasion would only be somber if our holds, cities and villages lie burnt.\n\nA true Viking must know how to fight! To every man capable of fighting, an axe must be an extension of the arm, a third joint which can deliver harm to all those who dare threaten us or wish us harm. Every boy, who reaches maturity must receive a weapon of choice to train with, to make his Ancestors proud in the mettle of combat. Every elderly man must be a shining example of a true warrior, with gray beards wrought into braids, hiding beneath them the scars of well-fought battles. We will be unstoppable!"

Even filled with all the inspiration of Týr, one mortal mind such as his is a vulnerable thing. In the case of the great Konung being indisposed, who would rule the army? Who would rally the men to seek retribution?\n\nTo better lead the army, the Konung shall appoint Jarls, all bearing the runes and the protection of Týr, to lead our men to glory. All shall lead as according to their liking, yet reporting to the ever-knowledgeable Konung. In times of crisis, the Jarls will come together, to be together the blade, shield and armor of our realm."

Weapons of warriors slain may not be of use to them, they cannot carry out their purpose, their one will and want stripped from them. With disuse they may grow restless, scoffing at any man who would disregard them, growing ever more unwieldy.\n\nThe weapons of our foes cannot go to waste, what was forged for war must alas indulge in its forge-cast destiny.

 jomsborg.3.desc: "Every few days, more news about EKW's downfall reach us. Today's news, however, have been... quite unorthodox. Apparently, Pomeranian regional media are informing about... a Viking raid on Kamień Pomorski. \n\nThe norsemen were led by Adrian Zandberg (apparently referred to as Halfdan Sandbjerg by his men), whom it looks like have finally returned back to the country after his exodus to Bornholm following the conflict between him and the Eurokommissariat's government. After his public denunciations of EKs' inner patologies and shady deals ultimately resulted in his arrest and a police raid on his house, Zandberg made a speech on how not even the EU is able to save the failed concept that is Poland, and that in order to build a respectable state, Polish identity as a whole needs to be replaced with a more noble, Nordic one."

 jomsborg.4.t: "Valkiries Calling"
 jomsborg.4.desc: "A battered, robust man stands upon the shores of Bornholm. His eyes are fixed on the south, to the lands that caused him much pain. That didn't stop him, however. Like a true warrior, he emerged stronger. The beatings from guards hardened his flesh. Fights with other prisoners helped him refine his technique. Through the bloodied eyes, he could see much clearer than before. He finally saw how the mask of humanity falls from capital, revealing the face of Fáfnir. He realised the system needed to be burned down to the ground and built anew.\nHis lust for vengeance didn't, however, blind him to the reality. The Eurolǫg still controlled a vast portion of his second homeland. He was sure the fragile order would soon crumble, but... It's been two years, and the German order seems unmovable. That gives time for his All-Army to grow and train, but they, too, grow restless. Restless and too massive to feed without terrorizing the local population. Because of Grucela, unsure at first at the idea of invasion, now urges haste and perhaps strike at the Vistula estuary region or sail through the strait of Piława. He doesn't realize it would be too dangerous. Besides, it has to be Wolin. Thankfully, his war leader, Adam Kościelak, agrees with him on that matter wholeheartedly. Biejat and Zawisza prefer to remain silent on that matter, although on the last council meeting, she snarkily noticed that, soon, they'll have to conquer Bornholm and declare independence.\nAt least the immediate problems eclipsed the long-term challenges that gnawed at his mind. The creation of his Great Northern Army and transforming Poland into an ideal society was, fortunately, a headache of tomorrow. Still, that wasn't the greatest of his worries. It has become apparent that despite dedication to moots and cooperation of equals, the future of the movement rested on him alone - the Carmine Jarl of Fólkvangr. People perceived him and admired him as a monarch. However, he knew all too well what happens when so much relies on a powerful individual. While he was sure he couldn't be corrupted, he started to believe his mind was slipping. He found ancient runes written in the soil and in his journal, despite not learning them before. Sometimes, when he stood on the shore, he often saw sea monsters on the horizon, and when he looked at the water, he found his reflection to be blurry despite the water being still."

 jomsborg.5.desc: "Far away from all the chaos of the European mainland, surrounded by the cold and tempestuous waters of the Baltic, a Danish island of Bornholm had its place. It's a calm and peaceful islet where life goes on slowly, away from busy center of Denmark. In their bliss, or maybe ignorance and blind trust, the islanders of Bornholm gave refuge to a group of refugees from Poland. Plenty of time has passed since the European intervention took place and numerous boats disembarked upon beaches near Svaneke. Locals, at first somewhat concerned, have eased their tense outlook after the leader of the Poles - Adrian Zandberg greeted them in their native Danish tounge, despite the welcoming speech being simple and very rusty. \n \n To not cause any trouble, the refuges formed a small commune just outside the town, building wooden huts out of any scraps they could scrounge up. As months passed the settlement grew in size, soon named Folkvangr, after the mythical refuge for fallen warriors ruled by goddess Freyja. Entirety of the village centered itself around the longhouse built out of discarded shipping containers - Sessrúmnir, where the Carmine Jarl held his meetings, and after dark planned his grand return. With a growing population soon came a need for a blacksmith, fishermen, shipwrights and traders who knew at least three words in Danish. Albeit small and desolate, the village of Folkvangr held an indominable spirit of determination, as each evening, when the sun set, the villagers gathered around the campfire to sing tales of the old lands, the ones stolen from them, and the ones they will take back. \n \n With time, the viking spirit started to spread throughout the community, as they all gravitated to the wise, yet sometimes unstable leader. As his mental strain increased, no doubt caused by years of unsuccessful attempts of peacefully taking over and improving the state of Poland, soon cracks started to show. The new identity of Halfdan Sandbjerg took root in the cracks of his mind, a stern viking high chief who would not bend a knee to anyone was needed to unite his broken, but faithful warriors and bring them back into glorious warfare against western invaders. \n \n With his personality shifted, a Great Temple of Odin was raised beside the longhouse, where Gothis appointed by him would lead ceremonies in the name of the Allfather. The adamant high chief Sandbjerg now looks upon his fledging settlement of lost but faithful souls, as he stands upon a hill, watching yet another drakkar take shape in the \"shipyard\". Soon the Viking warriors of Folkvangr shall sail south, and write a saga worthy of Valhalla!"

 jomsborg.8.desc: "Quiet skies above Bornholm, normally cloudy and peaceful, were broken by loud juddering of a helicopter. Rotor blades slashed through the morning fog as the Danish Royal Coast Guard aircraft made its way towards the anomalous settlement on the Eastern coast of the Island. Aboard it, sat Mikkel Rasmunsen, deputy officer of Capital Region Administration, a person not important enough to hold a position in the Copenhagen council, yet important enough to be sent out to investigate reports about a weird village somewhere in the Baltic backwaters of the Kingdom. He sat in the back of a Coast Guard helicopter with a folder full of wild descriptions of a \"wild Norsemen LARP Group\" setting up a permanent settlement outside Sveneke in one hand, and his temples in another. He cursed to himself that this is not what he spent years on best Copenhagen universities for. Soon however his angry meditation was interrupted by the pilot. \n \n - Deputy, sir, we're almost there. \n \n Looking outside the window, his eyes widened and eyebrows lifted high. Reports weren't exaggarated, it truly was a ragtag group of Viking LARPers living in a real norse temple tribe, however crude. The arrival of a \"shrieking silver bird\" caused quite a commotion in the village, as both men, women and children crowded outside their wood-mud huts pointing, waving and cowering before the \"monster\". \n \n - Put us down, I need to see this up close. - Mikkel spoke, in a feat of bewildered curiosity. \n - Yes, sir. - Pilot responded, proceeding to set down the helicopter upon an empty field nearby the village. \n \n As the rotors kicked up clouds of dust around the landing site, nearly all wildly infatuated villagers surrounded the aircraft, some bearing crude, rusty axes in their shaking hands. Mikkel opened the sliding side door as soon as the helicopter's wheels touched the ground, holding onto his folder tightly. Women and children shouted in fear, as the man in black exited the \"bird's belly\". The Danish deputy truly looked out of place in his suit, surrounded by unshaven Viking cosplayers covered in blankets and ripped up carpets. The remaining bravest of the men formed a shaking shield wall formation, and braced for a fight. Thankfully before anything bad happened, a tall and burly man emerged from the formation, other warriors cowered before him in respect. \n \n - Vælkomin outsider! - his boomy voice echoed around as he spread his arms in welcome, speaking very crude Danish. - Allfather be praised, messenger of Huginn and Muninn, I welcome you to Folkvangr! \n \n The atmosphere surrounding the landing site eased quickly, as shields and axes were lowered. Mikkel stood quite shocked, but quickly snapped back, fixed his suit and approached the Jarl who bore a long Carmine cape. Chief of the tribe was nearly elated, that his actions brought the attention of Odin's Ravens, as he led the deputy towards the longhouse in the center of the village. Mikkel reckoned, it would be in his best interest to simply play along and report what he saw afterwards."

Villagers gathered around the broken container which housed the melting kiln, watching as the work in the smithy continued every day, preparing weapons and armour for the upcoming invasion. Any item even vaguely metallic in nature that wasn't bolted to the ground by the Danish natives of the island, was subsequently acquired and repurposed by the Folkvangr host. Scrap melted in the steel kiln was the backbone of the settlements rearmament effort. \n \n Sitting on a stump nearby, an experienced warrior Bjorn was taking a moment to sharpen his trusty axe. The forge running day and night, required large amounts of wood and him, among other warriors on rotation helped in cutting wood logs for the fire. Each slide of the whetstone sent sparks onto the chilled ground. He longed for a return to the lands he, along with the rest of the tribe were exiled from, so each day he volunteered for extra work, to ensure the success of upcoming strife. Focused on his axe, and somewhat sleep deprived for weeks on end, he failed to notice the towering figure approaching him. \n \n - Ver heill ok sæll, Brother Bjorn. - A deep voice greeted him, bringing him up to attention. \n - Hail Jarl Halfdan! - He got up and holstered his axe, after which he placed his hand on his chest and bowed his head, noticing none other than the Chief of the tribe. \n - No need for bowing, brother. - Jarl quite roughly pat Bjorn's shoulder and gave him a reassuring smile from underneath his burly beard. - I had hoped you'd have some time to speak, in the Longhouse. \n - For you, anything, my Jarl. - He nodded, and followed his leader. \n \n With each step, the chainmail of the Jarl, made out of melted pots and pans clanged, magnifying his already dominating presence. His carmine cape flapped in the chilly seashore breeze. \n - The gods have noticed your sacrifice for the cause, and so have I. - Jarl spoke calmly, as the two arrived at the Longhouse. - You've been at my side longer than most. \n - Yes, Chief, even before the heathenous bastards exiled us. - His fists tightened, at the sheer thought. \n - Soon, my brother, soon. - he said reassuringly as the two entered through the doors. \n \n Inside, a group of elite warriors awaited them, bearing carmine shields and gjermundbu helmets. The troope bowed their heads before the Jarl, as he turned to Bjorn. \n - I wish for you, to join the ranks of my huskarls, and fight our foes in the name of Odin. \n - I'd be honoured to, my Jarl. - Bjorn bowed as Halfdan Sandbjerg himself, bestowed a housecarl helmet upon his head. \n The warriors cheered three times, \"skál! skál! skál!\", welcoming a new face among their ranks."

A village on the coast of the Baltic Sea like any other, made its living from tourism, however after the Eurocorps intervention, whole industry went silent seemingly overnight. Nowadays it's populated by a fraction of its original inhabitants, people either too proud, or too poor to leave and try to find a way to live in the new reality. \n \n Jan, a young adult native to the village, layed upon his bed and stared at the ceiling. He remained behind in a decrepid wooden hut to take care of his sickly grandma, after his brother disappeared, and his friends scattered among towns and cities of the region. In his insomnia induced rambling, he cursed the political establishment that led to how the country ended up. He rolled onto his side, and looked at the wall, onto which he taped an old, faded poster, carmine shade of which brought him peace, and reminded him of the time he and his brother used to be volunteers for Razem Party, years ago. Maybe this nostalgia was what made him believe in the rumours coursing throughout the village and beyond. That the exiled leader is very much still around, and has not forsaken his mission. With a sigh, he got up and rubbed his sleep deprived eyes. Stealthily, he snuck out of the hut, and walked towards the beach, hoping that the sea would bring him some respite. He sat down on the cold sand, and closed his eyes, listening to waves break against the shore. In this moment, he only wished for a sign, that things will change soon. \n \n Suddenly, he heard a sound of old wood hitting the sand. He opened his eyes, and saw a truly unusual sight, a boat, with a crudely carved dragon head on the bow. Two burly, bearded men clad in rough carpets coloured with carmine paint, jumped out and pulled the boat ashore. Jan was taken aback, but, the familiarly painted capes worn by the sailors ignited something in him. He ran up to them, tripping on the sand dunes. \n \n - Brother Ivarr, I'm glad to see you once more. - One of the men kneeled beside him, and reached his hand forward. \n - Zygmunt? Is that you, brother? - Jan took his hand, he remembered that face . \n - Agmundr now, brother. - The two siblings embraced tightly. - Odin be praised you're alright. \n - Where have you been? What's going on with this get-up? - Jan spoke in shocked surprise. \n - No time for explanation, brother, trust in Mimir's wisdom, and prepare for our return. Spread the word, Agent of Loki, for your past efforts haven't been forgotten. \n \n Ivarr stood up, with renewed determination. With a stern look on his face he nodded to his brother. Now him, alongside countless past volunteers were activated as sleeper agents, sowing a seed of revolution, before the return of the Carmine Jarl."

In normal circumstances, a few loud Poles on motorboats and jet skis would've resulted in a laugh from the proud German naval officer. But these circumstances weren't normal. The German army occupied hostile lands and was attacked from all sides. In this moment, the motorboats were as fierce as every drakkar, the shouting men were as good as any berserker. Among them was Oskar Węgorz, who recently changed his name to Öskuldr Ormríbrók and soon would try to prove himself in a baptism of battle.\nThe shores of Poland were getting closer and closer. Oskyldr couldn't wait to return to strike with vengeance at those who attacked Poland and at those who made it weak in the first place. His heart started beating faster.\nJust as the war council had expected, the Germans were too preoccupied with fighting against the land forces to expect a naval invasion. Good. Öskuldr and his squadmates started preparing a Molotov cocktail as the driver of his motorboat was getting closer to the Euroadmilarity's watercraft. When they got close enough, the flaming bottles flew towards the enemy boat, engulfing it with fire. The first point was scored. The Germans realised what was going on, but were too busy with retreating to secure positions to defend themselves. Only the sentries were able to fire consistently. Fortunately, Öskuldr's squad had a dedicated rifleman, who was able to answer lead with lead. Still, there was no time for careful dispatch of the coastal guard. The Germans had the invaders outgunned, and that meant the Norsemen had to advance right now before the defenders had a chance to regroup.\nWith a loud shout, Öskuldr, axe in hand, rushed to the beach with many other Vikings to chase the retreating Germans. Above his head flew the thrown axes, arrows, and few occasional bullets. He caught up to a wounded German soldier and cleft his head before he could shoot. With no time to appreciate the kill, he ran towards the enemy's sandbag wall toward a soldier, too preoccupied with shooting another attacker to notice Norseman's charge. For that, an axe crushed his head. Öskuldr jumped through the sandbags and struck another soldier. This one managed to block the attack with his carbine. With all his strength, the Viking pulled the carbine out of the German's hand thanks to the hooked blade of his weapon. He hit eurosoldier's nose with his forehead and followed with an axe strike at the stomach. His opponent fell to the ground. Öskuldr looked at the beach. His brothers in arms succeeded in other parts of the coast. The sound of a brass horn signalled a success."

He now realised there were worse evils to plague the land of Gryffins. The ones that come from the sea. After he heard of the heathens' advance and their marauding campaign, he realised that. He tried to atone for his anger by offering shelter for the wounded soldiers of the Admiralty. Even then, he didn't feel purified.\nI did it out of fear - he once said to his confessor, Father Marek Kuligowski - Out of fear and because I calculated that the Lizard Union would not come to our rescue in time. That's not how true regret should look.\nIf he was guilty of sin, let him answer for it! Would God strike at the heart of Pomeranian Christianity solely because of one parish's misdeeds?\nThe Norsemen came during the night.

He ran to the farthest depth of the church. He hid behind the sculpture of an archangel Michael. In those brief moments of refuge, he didn't find any peace. He could hear steps getting louder and louder. With them came the sound of looting. Priest, dripping in sweat, tried to calm his breath so they wouldn't find him.

Trying to connect his thoughts, he devised a plan to get to his family in Unibórz.\nWe missed one - the Viking, who finished the grave robbing, unfortunately noticed the hiding priest.\nThe other reached toward the priest and grabbed him.

They dragged him through the main church hall, where he saw the Vikings trying to undo 900 years of Pomeranian Christian history.\nThe Viking that caught him raised a hammer over the priests head."

A harsh fever combined with the wounds he received during the fighting, as well as a wariness that came from planning the invasion, took its toll. He had to heal in his bed.\nStill, a guilty conscience was more nagging than the physical ailments. In the dark of the night, he woke up and decided he needed to see the necropolis. He departed without his guards and departed in a simple nightshirt.\nOn top of the hill, he saw burial mounds marked with white stones and an extinguished fireplace - a sign of his followers' finished Blót. He looked closer at the remaining embers. To his surprise, they formed words written in runes - ARALD CVRMSVN. Only now did he feel how cold it was outside. Something wasn't right. The dead were upset.\nHe saw the ashes coming from the mounds and forming a whirlwind. Jarl covered his eyes with his arms.\nThen, before him, 13 undead draugrs formed from the ashes. One king with rotten teeth and 12 huskarls with ropes hanging from their necks.\n- We are Harald Gormson, known as Bluetooth, king of the Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, and Aldinburg. You have rejected the calling of Odin - harsh, hissing voice came from the undead mouth.\n- I am Adrian Zanberg, and I know you. -Jarl replied with stounch voice- Who are you to talk about the will of Odin. You disregarded him to follow Christ.\n- I did, and for that, my soul, our soul, lies in Hel, wasting with other weaklings. The same awaits you as well unless you accept my spirit and let your true nature take reign.\n- I would never do that.\n- You almost did. Back in the prison. Remember the blinding berserker's rage when you defended yourself in fights. It was your true nature trying to communicate with you.\n- I know you. You want to bring destruction, death, and rape upon all of the world. I want to help people. Elevate them from suffering.\n- Look around. All those things are already here in Wendland. Only by accepting your destiny will you be able to show your subjects how to survive in this new age.\nZandberg couldn't find a response to this.\n- Think of their afterlife as well. What good is 50 years of comfort, if it results in millennia of darkness of Hel? You want to help people? Help me. Let my soul enter your empty husk of a body, so I can find redemption as a warrior.\nJarl's silence was enough of a response to the apparition.\n-I know, you'll make the right decision. As a sign of my goodwill, accept the gift I brought you from Eir.\nJarl woke up in his bed. Drenched in sweat, but in impeccable health."

He rarely attended feasts or sang with his fellow warriors.\nSome thought that he wouldn't rest until all of the German menace was driven back through the Oder. Still, some of the jarl's excesses made people doubt that ferociousness guided him.\n\nZandberg stood at the entrance to the training camp for a discreet inspection. Men stationed there were training hand-to-hand combat in two teams. One team quickly incapacitated most of the other. Only one fighter remained. He wasn't going to give up, and the other team ganged up on him.\n-I give up - he shouted, lying on the ground, kicked and beaten by his opponents.\n-Enough! - Zandberg wanted to shout, but the words froze in his mouth. He knew the image of a helpless victim being beaten all too well. His heart began racing in his chest. His breath quickened.\n-Stop this! - He finally managed to utter the words. More panicked than anyone expected. The fight stopped as everyone turned their heads toward the jarl. The camp leader probably scolded the winning team. Zandberg wasn't sure as he walked out of the camp, marching quickly.\n\n- The Mighty Dane lies on the floor! - That's how Zandberg's torturer began every interrogation. Why was he hearing his raspy voice again? - Tell me the name of the leader of the Szczecin Razem cell.\nThen came the collective beatings.\n\n- The Mighty Dane lies on the floor! Tell me where Grucela is hiding?\nA kick to the head.\n\n- The Mighty Dane lies on the floor! Tell me where Bosak is hiding?\nA punch to the gut. \nRunning amok, Zandberg finally found himself in his personal tent. Inside, he tried to stabilize his breath, but the images, the sensations wouldn't go away. The pain of the beatings, the sights of other prisoners being tortured. The crooked smile of the torturer.\n-Damn bastard tore a hole in my head after all... If I see him again, I'll carve him one of his own! - Zandberg thought trying to find some reassurance. The momentary euphoria of the imaginary retribution passed as quickly as it appeared - Is there no end to this torment?\n'You know the truth...'\nZandberg couldn't register who was talking to him."

After days of continuous lobbying, jarl finally gave in.\nZawisza hoped it was an apt time to avoid the catastrophe. \n- Hello, would you like to support me in the coming moot? - She handed a flier to one of the warriors. Among the men in wolf skin and linen tunics she stood out like a sore thumb in a dark blue jacket.\n- Umm, I'm sorry - the man struggled to comprehend the contents on the paper. That's what bothered Zawisza. What's so complicated about 35-hour work day and lower retirement age. - I'm not interested in politics.\nThe next person she asked, a berserker, was even worse.\n- Sorry, lady. I'll follow Sandbjerg, not some socialist.\nIt looked like the carmine on the banners had faded more than she initially expected.\n- Equal sharing of loot! Thank you for signing my petition. - Magdalena Biejat smiled with her pearly white teeth to every passing Viking - Greater role of Althing! Thank you.\nHer colleague opted to mold her appearance to the new reality. Instead of a more usual dark blue jacket and trousers, she wore a marine green dress stylized for the Middle Ages. She seemed to gather more attention, but who knows how many of her supporters will stand with her when pushes comes to shove.\n\n- The time of Althing has come! - The beginning of deliberation has been announced. By Kościelak no less.\nAnother disappointment. Zawisza had hoped that the speeches they gave would move the hearts and minds of the soldiers as well as the common sense of Zandberg, but he was nowhere to be seen. Instead, he appointed Kościelak as the master of ceremony, clearly to win his favor. Not to mention, the first speaker that will be called would be...\n- Magdalena Biejat. Please give us your speech.\n- Oh, brave warriors - Magda began her exposé - I'd like to thank you for your sacrifice during the recapture of Polish lands. Without you, we wouldn't be here. In the chaos of battle it is often hard to remember what we're fighting for. We fight for our country and the future of our children. That is why we have to think of our future. Of mighty investments built from the recent influx of money. Of women's rights, who just like you fight in the maternity wards. \n- A few more sentences, and she might actually convince a good chunk of them. - Zawisza thought to herself - Soon, I'll have my time to shine.\nThen a horse arrived on the beach carrying the Carmine Jarl himself.\n- Thor spoke to me.

Upon arrival, they placed their latest bounty onto the miniature table and laid down on their sunbeds, ready for another day of lounging and not much else. \n\n- Helenka, hasn't this place been kind of a bore lately? \n- Sure. And now that you mention it... It does feel a whole lot emptier than usual. Even the Müllers have left. I guess that's what happens when you skimp on the entertainment. They've been running the same few shows for the past two months. \n- Right. And the energy just isn't there. It's like the performers are being forced to do it. \n- You know what? At this rate, maybe we should start thinking about switching to a different resort. \n\nSailing through the turbulent waves, the boats approached the shore. The invasion fleet had arrived to claim this strip of the coastline. \n\n- I'll make the reservations once we get back to our room. There are a few places that I... hold on, you see that too, right? \n- Looks like some sort of a... well, I'll be damned, Helenka! That's a Viking longship. \n- Now that's new!

I could probably get something better from the nearest costume store. \n- Oh, don't be such a grump. They're doing their best. Besides, it's only a rehearsal. There weren't any Viking invasion reconstructions in today's event programme. \n\nUpon making contact with the land, the raiders disembarked, looking for plunder. Most headed immediately for the main facilities, their tunnel vision induced by the promise of loot and berserker fury. Firmly wielding his axe, one of the pillagers approached the elderly couple, standing over them menacingly. \n\n- In the name of Odin, hand over all your possessions, and you will be allowed to live. I don't want to bloody my axe today because of you two. \n- Sir, I must say, you are doing a wonderful job. Very convincing. If only I could offer one small suggestion, you might want to work on your accent a bit. \n- I'm giving you one final chance. Your money or your life. \n- Excuse me, my wife just gave you a compliment. Aren't you even going to thank her? \n- Wrong choice. \n\nWithout saying another word, the raider raised his weapon, his expression stone cold and unamused. He readied himself to strike at the defiant locals. \n- Helenka, I'm starting to think he really isn't joking..."

He was holding a Danish history book in his hand. - You volunteered to join the Alþýduher, so you won't end up as worthless thralls. But that means something! That means you need to put up some effort, or you'll be sent back to your hometown of Plundered-Upon-Nowhere in a body bag. We wouldn't want that, would we? So, let's practice good old defensive formations. Let's start with a shieldwall.\nThe commander showed the recruits the page from the book and waited for the results.\nAspiring Vikings formed a square and raised their round shields one next to each other. One such line of shields protected the front, and two others were meant to protect the flanks. Those in the middle raised their shields to protect them from above.\n- No! No, it's all wrong! Weren't you watching?- The instructor exploded - You'd barely understand how Nordic walking works, not to mention Nordic formations! Your shields are round, so they only connect at a single point, leaving massive gaps if you raise them next to another. They have to overlap, like the scales of a snake. And form just one wall, not four for Thor's sake.\nThe new squad soon began learning the ropes and formed something that resembled the shieldwall from the history book.\n- Alright, let's see if the formation is functional. Archers!\nA squad of marksmen readied their practice arrows and aimed towards the recruits. They fired, and thankfully for the infantrymen, none of the arrows penetrated the formation.\n- Ah, you're practicing shieldwall - the training was interrupted by one of the thenegs with his elite squad - Impressive, this will surely increase our defensive capabilities. If we fight our enemies in flat terrain. In hills and forests, however, your soldiers would be easily outflanked. Not to mention an encounter with more advanced foes.\nHe gestured his hand to signal his elite men-at-firearms to aim at the shieldwall.\n- I hope you understand my message - he continued. Still, as we continue to face enemies with clubs and slingshots, it will suffice. And I believe it'll be timelessly effective as a method of pacifying unarmed rioters. Nevertheless, I'd implore you to train the recruits in more dynamic tactics, so they could catch up to the shooters before they pierce them with bullets.\nThe instructor tried to cover his shame and anger by lacing into the newbies.\n-You heard him, men.

And why do we need a cog when we have perfectly fine clippers sitting about? - Biejat's voice fell on deaf ears, as Zawisza was too spaced out after the hours of debating to be of any use, and Zandberg...\n- We must show people our side, our Northern side. If we can't show it to people abroad, how can we bring it upon the nation? Ourselves?! No! - Zandberg slammed his mighty fist upon the oaken table, shaking the beer tankard.\n- We're gonna sail in cogs, we're going to put shields on port and starboard, we'll use sails and we WILL go a-VIKING!\n Oars, sails, shields, raids. That was Zandberg's vision for his domestic and global journeys. He may have been talked out of cogs eventually, but his mind was set and singular as shieldwall. Biejat could slightly relate, having re-watched Vikings with him. Zawisza was just sitting in her own world, the faint sounds coming from her indicating some sort of k-pop.\n- We are Wends, arms strong, raiding the weak with our hird. Raze the world and make it right. Where the Viking Age finally meets today. - Biejat could no longer get through to him. She knew the state all too well: Zandberg would retreat into his own vision of an idealized Viking future and wallow in it, nevermind how removed it was from the dreams he shared with Zawisza and Biejat. Down goes the tankard down his throat. They say people get particularly candid when drunk. Was this rambling lunatic being his true self right now? Was this what he was all about right now?\n\n And then, Zawisza stood up. She downed her own portion of mead and... drew a bone flute. The melody drew Zandberg's attention, a melancholy and slow lullaby-like flow sedating him. A few moments later, a skald entered.\n\nHwerʀ mag an kwirū habē sigljan,\n rōan þan sa ni ā āru?\n Hwerʀ mag wiþʀ wini skiljan \n anþi ni falljan tāru? \n\n Who can sail without a wind, row without oars. Who can part from a friend, and not shed tears. The bard spoke in Proto-Norse, even older than what Zandberg was promoting among Wends\n- Marcelina, that's a fine arrangement... I think... I think I hear what you say with this. We will split friends apart by making those expeditions. You don't want me to split them apart forever... lightly.\n - That's right. We are viking, arms strong, yes, but if we show our true natures to the weak before we're ready for a response... there will be nothing left of us. We must know who to trade with and who to raid, as we set sail. Look at our own domain. We still lack so many things...\n - Yes... - Zandberg concurred. - We need trade partners more than we need enemies. A time will come to show the world our true strength, but first we attain it. First we trade... and take only from those we can handle. But remember, Marcelina... not even songs will tell me that the pain of parting with a friend is greater than the glory of a triumph for skalds to remember."

An anonymous source provided a record of supposed collaborators associated with the fallen Eurokommissariat's regime, a struggling local newspaper published it unvetted in a ploy to boost its readership, and the population gave it its own interpretation: for them, it wasn't a public shaming; it was a hit list. \n\nSteinn and Gunnarr were halfway through their patrol when the news of the article made the rounds enough to finally reach them. A short call from dispatch dashed any hopes of a warm lunch down at the station. Instead, they were given new orders: to guard the mansion of one of the senior officials. Not out of any ideological sympathy, but simply because the bureaucrat had made enough panicked calls, it was deemed less arduous to send in some protection than listen to his constant wailing and complaints. \n\nBy the time the two officers arrived, a crowd of about fifteen protesters had gathered outside the building. Steinn and Gunnarr posted themselves right by the front gate, looking at the would-be intruders threateningly to make it clear not to even try getting in. This seemed to somewhat de-escalate the tension, turning the situation into a prolonged standstill. \n\n- Say what you will, that's quite a nice house he's got there. I'd be angry too if I were them. The city took a pretty heavy beating during the war. This is probably the only place where you can't see it. - Steinn turned to his partner to break the boredom. \n- Bureaucrats, huh? Always the same story everywhere. \n- Right. Really makes you wonder if we're helping the wrong side sometimes. \n- That's cause we are. What's it feel like risking your life protecting a diehard lib? \n- Not great. Not great at all. \n- So, how about we just let things... take their natural course? You know, actually, I think we didn't make it here on time. The property was already looted by the time we arrived. Such a shame. \n- Now that you mention it... I mean... he wouldn't want us to intervene anyway, would he? 'The state shouldn't have a monopoly on violence' and all that? \n- Now you're getting it. Had he wanted protection, he would've hired it on his own. It's so simple. Why didn't we consider it earlier? \n- Look at us, Steinn. Now we're finally being the real heroes. Fulfilling that man's wish, letting him live and die by his beliefs... It's almost beautiful. Brings a tear to my eye. \n\nWith an understanding gesture, the two partners each took a few steps to the side, leaving the entrance to the mansion wide open. Almost immediately, the angry masses began pouring onto the property. Steinn and Gunnarr drove away, satisfied, leaving the official to face the people's anger."

To do so, their warchief ordered the civilian population to be routed and brought to the main street.\n- I am Helgi Fallöxi - proclaimed a mighty Viking.

Finally, one man stepped forward.\n- I'll do it.\nHe approached the Viking and took his axe. The huskarls of Helgi readied their sword in case the voluntary executioner tried something funny. The man raised the Viking axe and kept it in the air, while looking into the eyes of the captive.\n- Please - the businessman's face was dirty from sweat, ash, and blood.\nThe axe fell nonetheless.\n- Blessed be Tyr! - Fallöxi shouted, while raising the severed head of the executed. Then he tossed it away and handed the promised money to the man. - You can keep the axe. Use it to continue the harvest. All of you can gain if you bring the wicked to the slaughter.\nThat started the carmine-red fire in the hearts of many.

Lizard as he was called by his enemies and some \"friends\". Though wearied by years of war and wandering, he stood tall, clinging to what pride he still possessed. In one hand he held a nicked sword, in the other, a weathered leather shield. He said nothing, lost in the memory of battles - those fought before the cameras, and those waged in forests and scorched villages. Then a great roar thundered through the air, silencing the crowd. The silence was broken only by the slow, heavy beat of footsteps. Into the ring stepped Halfdan, taller than any man, clad in the hide of a bear, an axe in each hand. Beside him walked his retainer, who stopped between the two warriors, unrolled a scroll, and read aloud:\n\n- Wojciech Olszański, you have been challenged to holmgang by Halfdan Sandbjerg, for evil deeds done against the people of Wendland and the republic they held dear. You shall fight with chosen weapons. Broken shields may not be replaced. The duel ends in death, and the victor shall claim the spoils of the fallen.\n\nWith that, the warriors stepped closer, face to face, waiting for the Norse herald to leave the circle. The Dane struck first, swinging from above, but Wojciech caught the blow on his shield and countered with a slash from the right. Halfdan leapt aside and struck again, another downward blow, again blocked. The crowd howled anew, hurling curses at the one called out.\nWojciech thrust his blade forward, but Halfdan stepped back, caught the sword between the haft and blade of his axe, and wrenched it free, hurling it to the edge of the ring. So fierce was the move that Halfdan stumbled, unbalanced, leaving his guard open. Olszański seized the moment - he swung, and with all his fury, smashed the shield into the Dane's head. Halfdan staggered backward, dazed.\n\nSeeing his foe charge, Lizard surged forward - but the Dane, now enraged, charged as well, raining blows upon the already-weak shield. Wojciech heard the wood split - a terrible crack - and then he was on the ground, beneath the towering Viking. Halfdan cast aside his axes. He leapt onto his foe, striking his head again.\nAnd again. And again. And again.\nThen - silence.\n\nAnd Wojciech found himself upon a green meadow, beneath a sky untouched by smoke.\nAround him stood his comrades.\nAnd his wife.\nHis kin."

Far from the marshes came the ungodly hiss, a thousand voices of defiance followed by harrowing howling. There dwelled the Lizards, partisans of the old forsaken nation, with their spears slick with venom, and their eyes bright with hate.\n\nThe clash came suddenly - steel on bone, fang on flesh. In the mire they met, in the mire they bled. Axes fell like thunder, shields splintered like trees in a storm. Poisoned darts pierced muscle, and foaming mouths roared louder than horns. One berserker split three Lizards with a single sweep, his axe singing its iron hymn before he drowned in black water. Another, pierced through the chest, held a foe aloft and tore its throat out with his teeth.\n\nThe bog drank deep. The bog was a butcher's altar. Limbs torn from sockets, skulls crushed to pulp, bodies sinking while bubbles rose like ghostly prayers. The reeds swayed with the weight of corpses, and the soil itself grew red, steaming like a battlefield forge. Yet still they fought. Hours turned to days. Days turned to weeks. Weeks turned to eternity. Every death was answered by another, every scream by a roar. The Lizards struck from trees, from water, from shadow. The berserkers answered with fire, with steel, with madness. Neither side yielded. Neither side won. Only the bog claimed triumph.\n\nWhen the sun at last broke through the mist, silence was the only inhabitant of these lands. The ground was carpeted with carrion, the pools choked with gore. Ravens circled, their wings black banners over a massive kingdom of the dead. The berserkers who crawled from the swamp bore the mark of doom upon them. The Lizards who slithered away swore oaths of vengeance.\n\nThus it is sung: in the Bog of Red Sorrows, no man is victor, no beast triumphant. Only death, eternal and unbroken, carved its saga in mud and blood. But those who survived will bear the marks of these clashes forever. And it will make them the greatest warriors that ever entered the annals of our history. They will be our iron fist in the coming fights."

The stick that broke the camels back was agitating local populace against the "nemesis", calling for a revolution. News of that came to attention of the central government, and the Carmine Jarl himself, so a political officer has been dispatched to bring peace to the village. \n \n A van arrived, after a complete slog of a drive, having been stuck in mud countless times, on the rough and wet country roads. Zbigniew, a junior level officer has been sent here, in the middle of nowhere to engage the right wing agitator in a debate, for the benefit of the local stability and wellness of the people. He sighed, hoping this could be his breakthrough moment in his political career, he grabbed his notes and left the van. With a splash, he dirtied his suit with mud, "Great" - He thought. Rolling his eyes, he fixed his carmine tie, and began approaching the small crowd surrounding the washing machine agitator. \n \n - Here come the agent of the devil! - Speaker shouted loudly. - He's here to take away your freedoms! Steal your money! Change your kids gender! \n \n Crowd jumped up in anger, with pitchforks and torches slowly appearing in their hands. \n \n - Please, friends, fellow people of the countryside, I'm not here to do any of these things. - Zbigniew spoke, making his way through the angry mob. - All the government is trying to do, is make sure, all your needs and wants are satisfied! Everyone in the land deserves to be happy, deserves a chance, an opportunity and social justice! \n - Don't listen to the red menance, he speaks tomes of sweet lies to CONTROL YOU! - Agitator shouted up once more, somewhat missing the irony of his words. - Leave now, and take your despicable, dirty ideals back with you! \n \n With a squeel of metal, the rear doors of the van broke open. Attention of the people was captured by a clang of chainmail, and a grunt of a bearded warrior. Everyone in the square was a bit dumbfounded, with Zbigniew sighing, and whispering to himself - "it's the fifth time this week..". An axe thrown by the viking, like lightning from clear skies, split the head of the agitator in half, sending the crowd into panic. \n \n - RAAAAAAH! ODIN LOVES ALL OF YOU!!!"

 jomsborg.32.desc: "The victorious Norseman sat solemnly in the dimly lit Viking's Throw pub in Szczecin, remembering their fallen brethren. Everyone waited and gazed upon the noble Halfdan Sandbjerg. In accordance with ancient traditions jarl was supposed to be the first to eat and drink on a feast. Adam Kościelak was appointed as his cupbearer. The Viking leader was still unsure of his destiny, but he was certain of one constant: he was a politician. Bestowing Kościelak with one honor after the other would secure his position in the party and army alike. He took a chalice from his hersir and emptied it in one sip. He looked seriously at his companions in the hall. Then he threw the chalice and roared with joy. Encouraged, the hall erupted with raucousness of its own.\nJarl's position was secure. His followers were ready to mimic him down to the last minute detail. It was inspiring. But also tiring. Refraining from monocracy in the party was not only an expression of dedication to egalitarianism, but a good way of avoiding too much work being done by one person. Especially if that person was Zandberg. To chase away the worries of the last months, jarl gestured for more mead. Still, not enough. Now, his mind was occupied by the memory of those morbid ghosts of the past.\n- Cup-bearer, another one. \nKościelak almost spilled the drink. Zandberg thought that he would've appointed someone more competent, if not for the need for the politicking. Why does it really have to be this way? Marcelina and Magda, sitting so close to him, elevated. They should be his friends. Instead, they play in factionalism.\n- Make that two chalices, actually, Adam.\n\n- And what does this... wirelessly connected dead guy know *hic* about vikinging that he wants my body. I already know everything by the saga. I'm a viKING! Ha! The best one since Harold Hard-drive *hic*. - Zandberg started arguing with himself. - Anyone doubts that?\nHe stood up and headed to the center of the hall.\n- You - he pointed at a random Viking - You know, who's the greatest Viking raider of all time?\n- Erm, Ragnar Lothbrok probably.\nAnother one doubted in his prowess. Ridden with grief, Zandberg punched the irresolute soldier.\n- And where is Ragnar Lothbrok now? I'm the greatest! Anyone doubts that? Fight me! I'll pass the jarldom to whoever defeats me!\nNot many accepted the challenge. Those who did fell under the powerful punches of the Mighty Dane. One was even tossed on the table.\n- Ok, that's enough! - Someone tried to subdue the jarl with words!\n- Who dares... oh, it's... You, Marcelina - Zandberg struggled to remain on his feet.\nSoon, she was joined by Magda.\n- Let's get out of here."

A great carmine whale now slept peacefully, loudly snoring over the puke bowl. \nZawisza exited the room to get some fresh air. Outside she looked upon the shore and realized that the whole process took them so long, the sun has already risen. Biejat soon joined her colleague. \n- How's the agitation going? - Zawisza asked Biejat while still looking at the sunrise. \n- Great, actually - the shine of Biejat's enthusiasm put the shy morning sun to shame - The cancellation of first althing was beneficial to us. We got more time to prepare. Also because now all of Western Pomerania is under our control, we can reach to greater electoral base, so the althing election can be as democratic as possible. \nZawisza raised her eyebrow and turned her eyes on Biejat. She knew where this was going. \n- That was not part of the plan. The plan was to keep the turnout as low as possible, so we have to convince as few voters as possible to our policy. \n- Yes, that's what I did. - Biejat's voice remained calm - I convinced as many of the old guard as possible. I reached to the dedicated socialist, but that was not enough. The formers are worshipping Zandberg and the latter aren't as numerous. We need to bet on the quantity. \n- And who do you think, you're going to attract? - Zawisza's frustration grew - You know, you can't reason with the liberals. \nBiejat took a breath, looked at her colleague. \n- You know we want the same, Marcelina - the woman said with a delicate, placating smile - But we need allies and I can take care of that. If you think that the core supporters and party are so important, maybe you focus on Adam and his growing affection for Zandberg's excesses. \n- Oh, you think it's my fault that a grown man wants to play a Viking? \n- No, that's not what I meant. - Biejat remained defensive - It's just a suggestion. \n- Whatever - Zawisza was tired by the unslept night and all those games. - Do what you want. After all, you weren't put in jail by the burgois, but I wouldn't push my luck if I were you."

 jomsborg.34.desc: "The Great Northern Army gathered on the Silver Mountain in Jomsborg. Once again. The members of Zawisza-Biejat faction hoped that this one wouldn't be dissolved by Zandberg. Thankfully for them, this time jarl was present. He was sitting on a wooden throne and seemed to be in rather somber mood. \nMagdalena Biejat looked upon all those, who came to voice their opinions. The number of warriors grew exponentially. There was also a sizable amount of civilians, who realized that People's Republic of Jomsborg is the local hegemon and that it might be a good idea to have some say in what the new regime. In fact the sea of people willing to participate was so large that there weren't enough loudspeakers to ensure everybody could listen. Biejat readied herself to give a speech on the behalf her faction to all those people. \n- Welcome to the second Althing! - Adam Kościelak kept his office of a speaker - In the name of our jarl, I give voice to the member of the council - Magdalena Biejat. \n- Thank you - Biejat regretted that the best introduction was wasted for the mess that was the first Althing - We now stand firmly upon the lands secured to us by the valiant effort of our army. The military progress was achieved so quickly, that many among our own worry, what'll do, when there'll be nothing more to conquer. \n- Weaklings! - some shouted from the crowd - The fighting never ends! \n- There are question of returning to democracy, of the benefits for the civilians and soldiers with disabilities and of the fair economy \n- Cowards unwilling to fight don't deserve mercy! - The crowd grew more and more aggressive in their tone. \nAdam Kościelak looked at the angry gathering of bloodthirsty berserkers with understandable fear. Then he gave a Zandberg a quick glance looking for approval, but jarl's face hasn't flinch. \n- The ways of Odin served us well so far and are in tune with the left-wing values we all share. - Adam argued - Never after 1989 have there been a more successful way of wealth redistribution, even from the clergy. Enviromentalism has never been more popular among all social classes than it is today. \n- But you of all people should know about the distortions that take place. You adhere to much to the old ways. \n- No, Magda. It is you, who fails to realize your views are outdated. We can't keep the same program as we did before the Fall. The world's changed and we have to adapt to this brutal reality with enforcing our ideals with warrior's ethos. Who's with me? - the question was directed to the crowd. \nMost of the warriors cheered for Kościelak. \n- And who still believes that another politics is possible? - Biejat decided to count the axes loyal to her. \nHer supporters were mostly civilians. All in all there was a 50/50 split. \nThen Zandberg raised his hand and left the field."

Some younger workers at the town hall were struggling to adapt, but Kazimiera Jędrzejak has already survived one seemingly diametrical regime change; she could do that again. Then suddenly, the silence of the office was broken by the loud sounds of someone choking on a herring. Apparently, someone was having a lively discussion in Danish just outside Kazimiera's room. The two perpetrators soon came in; The armor they wore indicated that they served in the jarl's army. \n- Good morning - said one of them in clear Polish - me and my husband got married back in Denmark, when Alþýduher was still stationed on Bornholm. We would like a transcription of our marriage act to make it legal here in Poland.\n- I'm afraid the current law makes it impossible - Kazimiera replied monotonally- If you're interested in the typical benefits of marriage you can petition for joint loot ownership in room 4, in room 16 you can regulate the question of inheritance of drakkars and in room 6 you can authorize anyone to receive letters addressed to you or be informed your health state after a battle. Please note that some services require additional payment. \n- You don't seem to understand. - The petitioner remained unyielding - My husband has a daughter from a previous marriage. If he passes away during the war, the girl I raise with him will have no one here to take care of her.\n- I understand completely - the bureaucrat didn't take too kindly to someone trying to falsely suggest her incompetence. - The girl will receive a PESEL number, an act of birth, and a passport, in which we can only name a single father and a single mother. If anything happens to her father, she will be sent back to her family in Denmark or placed in an orphanage. \n- Bullshit! - The man has had enough. His husband tried to calm him, but it was futile - We follow gods of incest, rape, and gender-changing, but where two loving people can't get a paper legalizing marriage that has already been contracted? \n- Yes, you're making perfect sense, sir. - The bureaucrat looked from behind her glasses. The men looked at each other, a little disoriented.\n- In case of your sudden deification, you and your partner are welcome to renew the petition to receive a marriage transcription.

In his wisdom, he decided to head to the conference room. \nIn it, he found all of the council. All of them looked at him with compassion. \n- We're worried about you, Adrian - Biejat, as always began as the diplomat. \n- In the past... years, you haven't been yourself - Zawisza stuck to facts as always. \n- Your... attitude helped us in the past, but sometimes you seem to lose yourself - Kościelak, still undecided. \n- That's why we still support you, but I think you should get some professional help. - Grucela finished with a straight-to-the-point conclusion. \n- I understand you - Zandberg decided to convince his troubled companions - At first I was scared too, but in time I began to accept that I have been blessed with a gift. I'm still not sure how to use it, but it's something that will help us unite Poland and shape it in a way we have always dreamed of. You seemed to understand that, Adam. Kościelak moved his head down in shame and tried to explain himself. \n- It served us well when we were the underdogs in the north. But you know that the Vikings changed their way when they ventured beyond Scandinavia. \n- We're by no means specialists - Grucela continued the offensive - but from what it looks like, you seem to be suffering from some sort of mental illness. \n- I hear you - Zandberg replied - I thought the same thing, but you see the whole point of mental illnesses is that you suffer because of them. And since I accepted that I can speak with the souls of the Vikings, I don't suffer. \nZawisza rolled her eyes. I feel great, actually. - Zandberg continued - I see all those possibilities and realize that I am the only one who can guide humanity in this new age. The ghosts aren't a problem if I keep shedding the blood of the enemies. But that's because we're in a war. - But, what if the war ends - Kościelak chimed in. - I don't think it ever will. Enemies hide in the shadows. Always. - Ok - war leader took a moment to think - What are your conditions... What if the ghosts start to demand more? We can't rule out mental illness based solely on our whim. That's what has always separated us from Mentzenites and other such types.

I feel the deep connection with my ancestors that guide me and, through me, you to victory. In the last months, our movement has achieved more than it had in the last decade. \n- But at what cost? - Grucela pressed on - The authoritarianism is against everything we stand for. \n- That's where you're wrong, friend. - Jarls answered calmly and recited - I trow I hung on that windy Tree. Nine whole days and nights, stabbed with a spear, offered to Odin, myself to mine own self given, high on that Tree of which none hath heard from what roots it rises to heaven. Ere long I bare fruit, and throve full well, I grew and waxed in wisdom; word following word, I found me words, deed following deed, I wrought deeds. \n\n- What do you do that's supposed to mean? - Zawisza finally broke the silence. \n- I know the meaning of the runes. I know how to read them. The people can already freely enter my mind, for I accept and care for them. Soon, they'll trust me completely as well, and then I'll be able to enter their minds. Then no democracy will be needed. \nZawisza looked at Grucela reproachfully. Biejat was bewildered. Kościelak was scared, but fascinated.

He ventured onto the country paths and admired how the light of the moon enveloped the lands he had conquered. He finally came upon an old, empty village. Not plundered, just abandoned. It consisted of houses with white walls crossed by dark wooden beams. Their rooftops were mainly made of thatch. Some were covered with roof tiles. In the center of the village was an old stone well. Zandberg approached it and tossed a coin for good luck. \n- Wishing for a good future? - A woman's voice sounded as soon as the coin hit the water sheet - I guess, you can't wish for good past after all. Who are you? - Zandberg said as he looked back. The woman wore a green dress and her hair was blonde. She passed him by and went to gather water from the well. \n- Who are you asking? - The woman didn't look at him. She was focused solely on the descending bucket. \n- It's impolite to not answer the question. Especially when the jarl is asking it. \n- Drink - she handed him a bucket of water from the well - You look thirsty. \nSomething hypnotic in her voice urged him to do as she told. \n- I am Urðr, one of the Norns - the sisters of fate - she told Zandberg as he took a first sip. \nJarl's vision began to blur. He once again saw the prison in which he was held. He remembered the betrayal, his predictions few believed, and the injustice that the oppressed experienced. The hardship his fellowship faced as refugees on Bornholm. \n- So much anger, so much pain. - Urðr was accompanying the jarl. She touched his face - Yet, it wasn't always like that, was it? \nShe took his hand and went further down the stairs of memory. Zandberg saw the times before the fall. The images have never been so vivid before. He saw the vast seas of the youth inspired by his speeches against the electoral malpractice. He saw the Razem members congratulating him on the performance in the 2015 presidential debate. \nEven deeper. He saw the life in Denmark. Himself as a little boy. His parents, who left the comfortable, social democratic Denmark to answer the call of a home plagued by an evil dictator, who thought he knew everything. He remembered his short career as a child actor and the honor of being one of the first people to use the Internet in Communist Poland. \nHe blinked and was back at the village. The bucket in his hand was empty, and Urðr was nowhere to be found. \nHe mounted his horse, travelled back to his apartment, and fell asleep."

His eyes were still not used to the brightness, but he could already hear that familiar rattle, except now, there were four more unfortunates bound along with him. After climbing up the three steps onto the main platform, he could finally make out what had previously been an unbearable, deafening buzz. Hundreds of angry voices hollering, throwing insults at the condemned. At that point, he understood his fate. \n\n- Quiet! Behave yourselves, peasants! Do you not know who stands before you? - At the warrior's command, the crowd went silent, leaving only mocking expressions. At last, Karol could finally hear his own thoughts. \n\n- That's better. We wouldn't want to give the wrong impression now, would we? Sigmundr, release our finalists from their chains! \n\nWith his hands free, the tycoon glanced around the arena, looking for a potential escape route.

The warrior playing the role of the host held him by the shoulders, bringing a microphone up to his face as soon as he regained a stable footing. \n\n- So, Karol... That was quite an impressive performance. You've been on our radar for a while now, but your recent efforts... inspiring, really. \n- Wait... what is this all even about? What performance? \n- You did it. You won capitalism. That's what you've always wanted, right? Please accept this humble gift on behalf of us all. We know it's nothing when compared to your fortune, but let this horn of plenty symbolize your commitment to wealth. \n- I uhh... thank you, I'm honored. \n- Mhm. Tie this band over your eyes. We have one more secret reward for you; this one far more befitting someone of your status. \n\nKarol obeyed, still slightly suspicious.

The village-wide sanitation unit shut down, lights went out, and soon, from one thousand dwellers, only five hundred remained. The rest dissipated into darkness, returning as brigands to fleece off whatever we had. Like a heart, our church got sacked and ripped off as though there was no God. Likewise, those of us who remained, got ripped apart and worse.\n\nWe moved on. A hundred of us. Each day our numbers waned. Hunger and splittage made hope dwindle. Brigand bands were usually warded off with shotgun fire. The whole nation went back in time to 700s, when hillforts ruled and nowhere was safe. Any fortified community either refused us or tried to rip us off.\n\nAs we bled numbers, the raiders were emboldened. Brazen enough to try violate our women and children in front of us. Their mothers led the charge to fight back and were filled with bullet holes. The rest of us overpowered them. That night, meat was back on the menu at last.\n\nAnimalistic from turning fellow man into meat, desensitised from hardship, we soon fired upon any one armed group we encountered. But I could tell from any one of us they did not sign up to become one with brigandry roaming these lands. And yet, there was no other way to live. The alternative was oblivion, which beckoned for many.\n\nThe past, the times we fell back on, finally reached their final form that fateful night. We were on our way to Jomsborg, which legend had it, would welcome all like us. We did not believe in legends anymore, but so what? Worst that can happen is we all die.\n\nAnd so when bearded warriors came, with axe and mail and all, we laid down our weapons. For nothing but a pipe dream. What followed was us feasting with them.

They will not feel any difference. \n- Do you know everything about the present? - Zandberg asked. \nThe Norn nodded. \n- What do the council members think about me and my rule? \n- Your right-hand woman is angry with you. She doubts you. She knows the pain of the internment camps, but thinks you learned the wrong lesson. She schemes with the Smiling One, who in turn schemes against her. They try to advance their own goals, but they won't raise their hand against you. The camaraderie they share with you pairs well with your usefulness as a symbol for the masses.

The power of his heritage and the fact that the most capable people he knew told him he was wrong. \n- I told you about their feelings because you asked me. - Verðandi could sense the split in his mind. She stood up and came closer to him - But you have to remember where your true loyalties are. There are only 4 people in this room, and 40 million waiting for their defender. Their jarl.

Before he could realize where the attack came from, he realized all of his personal guards were dead. Their bodies were spiked with arrows. They fought valiantly nonetheless. Only one ambusher was well enough to exit the bushes his squad hid in. Injured in his back, he headed towards Zandberg, who was unable to get up. \n- Death to the Carmines! - The assassin shouted as he raised a trench mace above jarl’s head. \nZandberg closed his eyes, reading himself for his fate.

Then, much to the shock of both men, she stabbed a would-be jarl-slayer in the stomach. \nThe warrior looked at Zandberg and then wordlessly approached the bodies of huskarls to examine them. \nZandberg took a closer look at his saviour.

I am Skuld, the Norn of Future. \nAfter she finished her sentence, she whistled. A white horse came from one of the forest paths. Despite his injuries, Zandberg was able to stand up and, together with the Norn, sat ahorse. \nThen they rode fast. Faster than any car, train, or plane. They found themselves in a city of the future. With clean air, with trams and buses instead of the endless car traffic. He saw a workers’ collective on every corner running a business, and in the distance, an atomic power plant. He saw the news about dropping inequalities as the Althing held a debate between Zawisza and Biejat. With Zandberg overseeing it. But soon the dark clouds gathered upon the idylla. The news started talking about a monster devastating the cities of Poland. A bleeding, decaying Jǫrmungandr. Soon, people raised the Nordic idols. People and house animals were routed to the streets. They bowed to the self-proclaimed goði, who demanded a sacrifice to stop these evils. The greatest Blót of all time took place. People cheered for Thor, but he never came. Instead, a fiery maw opened in earth - those were the gates of Múspellsheimr. Out of them came a host of jǫtunar on horses. Their leader was grey as a draugr and his eyes glowed yellow. He wore a mask made out of the deer’s skull. The trolls trampled the people who summoned them and set fire to much of the world. However, after the bloodshed, they will fly on their horses and strike at the Jǫrmungandr, who, due to the horned appearance of the jǫtunn leader, will mistake him for his father Loki. The Grey Jǫtunn then became a cruel ruler of what’s left of humankind. \nThe vision ended. Zandberg woke up at the ambush site. His leg was still hurting, but at least all of the assailants were dead. Help was already on its way. But they wouldn’t be able to assist Zandberg with making the correct decision."

 jomsborg.47.desc: "'Ever before the formation of the state centered in Gniezno, the lands upon Vistula were inhabited by the Vandals that defined Wendland Germanic heritage for centuries to come.' \nDr. Jan Dokalfar was struggling with writing a schoolbook in accordance with the new curriculum, which stated that: 'All Wendish children shall know in their hearts and minds that the blood of the Scandinavians fills their veins.' He took a deep breath and got to work. \n'Everyone knows of the Scandinavian heritage of the first historical ruler of our country - Dago, who, for his Slavic subjects, adopted the name Mieszko. \nThe genetic studies confirm this hypothesis. Mieszko's predecessors were travellers from Scotland, a target of Viking raids and colonization. During his rule, the influx of Nordic settlers came to the Vistula to serve the Pjastr dynasty. Their descendants were known as Wends, and they lived alongside their Slavic neighbors, known as the Poles. From now on, the names Poland and Wendland were used interchangeably among its Germanic neighbours. While the country after the Great Migration was predominantly Slavic, its Nordic elites shaped the culture of the kingdom. \n- I'll need more mead for this... - Jan took a quick break and returned to writing. \n'The unified Wendish monarchy lasted with some interruptions until 1138 r., when duke Burisleif Skævmundede ultimately divided the country and his successors lost the royal title. This vacuum was filled by Knud IV of Denmark, who used the cultural similarities of Danish and Wendish cultures and usurped the title of the king of the Wends in 1185. The title was recognized by the Pope, and so from now on the Pjastr rulers, such as Przemysł II and Władysław the Elbow-High, had to satisfy themselves only with the title of the kings of Poland." \nAnother sip. \n'Despite the loss of the title, the ties between Poland or Wendland and Scandinavia were well-known around Europe. It's no coincidence that William Shakespeare, in 'Hamlet' - a play about a Danish prince mentions in the same breath Norway, England, and Poland, proving the latter shared just as much history with Denmark as the former. The character of Polonius, the royal advisor, also exemplifies the close connection between the two nations. \nAlthough in the modern era the Polish elites distanced themselves from their Wendish past, they remembered it well. That is why in 1587, Swedish prince Sigismund Vasa prevailed in the struggle for the crown against the Austrian candidate and established the longest-lasting elective dynasty.' \nDoctor of history looked at his diploma on the wall, disgusted with himself. In the new schoolbook, he couldn't write the most obvious resemblance between Wendland and Denmark."

While most of the data was compiled without major issues, one thing continued to haunt him. Nationality. How, in such a state, was one to define who one really was, when even the state itself and its leader didn't seem to know for certain?\n\n-  Leaving it open-ended was a mistake. What possessed me to decide that the box on the form for national affiliation should be an open question? - Olaf grumbled time and again, sipping his third coffee alongside his fourth energy drink at a very late hour.\n- Maybe I'll just sort it somehow...\n\nBut no approach yielded sensible results. Every time someone wrote down a different term for the same thing, yet at the same time, it could be interpreted as a separate identity. In the end, Olaf concluded he had to start from the basics if he was to make any attempt at narrowing down the range of answers.\n\n- How am I even supposed to interpret someone writing here that they identify as a potato, a combat helicopter, or a Tibetan fox? This isn't about gender identity, so why the jokes?! Unless... actually. A refusal to answer, or an answer written satirically. That'll sift out a few entries.\n\nThat didn't even put a dent in the overwhelming stack of queries waiting for him.\n- Okay, then. Foreigners. Those other...foreigners. Ukrainians. Easy. Russians. Lithuanians. Jews. Romani. That's fine. Germans. Okay. Wait...it's not...German...it's...GERMANIC? What the hell does that supposed to mean?! Is he...a German of Germanic faith...or Germanic as in some ancient barbarian tribe? It's the same shit all over again, GODS.\nSo, even these were not as easy to catalogize as they would seem. Olaf spent another three hours trying to sort all German-ish people into one stack before he started overlapping them with the Norse stack.\n- This is bullshit. I didn't even get to those who wrote 'Viking' in there. IT'S A GOD-DAMN VERB, NOT AN IDENTITY. Maybe...I could publish two censuses? Oh, they would've sent me for sensitivity training nonetheless because we had to be inclusive. How am I supposed to single out every possible combination where it looks like an autism spectrum?!

The parish priest, Father Sławomir Mazurkiewicz, let him in when he was still shocked and exhausted after he escaped from a brute named Brandr. \nThe priest of Bierzwnik offered him everything he needed and even asked Paweł to return to his calling as his unofficial vicar to heal the banished priest's soul. Michniewicz refused the offer. He didn't want to go against the official Church hierarchy even under special circumstances. That and he still felt guilty because he had been broken and had left the faithful to the wrath of Northmen. \n- I'm not ready. Maybe later. - He said after each time Mazurkiewicz brought up the matter. - My mind needs to be clear. \nThat was easier said than done. Each night, he had woken up, reminding himself of the sack of Kamień Pomorski. He spent a lot of time looking at the window in case a Viking patrol was heading towards the church, and never went too far from any hiding spots, just in case. He even asked Father Sławomir if he had any plan if the invader decided to plunder his parish this time. \n- Look - Michniewicz had answered him then - I appreciate your concern and understand you've been through so much pain. But my humble church is not of the same rank as the Cathedral of St. John. It's neither as rich in artifacts nor as important as a symbol. Besides, now the Vikings need to rule the land they conquer. They can't keep plundering it. Father Sławomir seemed to be right. Paweł grew to appreciate his new home. He dared to venture outside the parish and help with the housework and found some comfort in the lives of the saints, who faced persecution. He liked reading them at the nearby lakes. \nHe later regretted letting his guard down. \nWhen he returned from one such trip to Lake Bierzwnik, he noticed a crowd with spears and torches waiting in front of the parish. He froze for a good moment, but then clenched his fist, made a sign of a cross, and approached the crowd. \nThe Vikings were stealing all that glittered from the Church, as well as the items local archaeologists have brought to exhibit. What they took, they threw to the gathered civilians. Then they dragged Father Sławomir out of the church. Maybe so he can serve as a thrall. Maybe to kill. Michniewicz decided to act this time. \n- Hey! - he shouted at the top of his lungs, and all of the sacrilegious plunderers looked at him - Leave him alone! \nThe captured priest took his chance and headbutted the Viking holding him in the nose. Mazurkiewicz began running, and another raider rushed to chase him \n- Leave him be! - their leader ordered - Here we've got a hardy specimen with much more potential.\nPaweł became slave once more..."

He contemplated how he found himself in the situation. \nAfter he had escaped from captivity, he took refuge in various Western Pomeranian parishes, knowing that if the Vikings searched him and found a thrall’s mark on his chest, he would be enslaved again or put to death. Besides, he had to see for himself what the so-called amnesty for the Catholic Church looks like. People were more likely to accept a 'rational secular policy’ than an oppressive regime. Their goal is still the same: to turn away people from Christ; create a spiritual void so their dead religion can fill the hearts of Poles in due time. And even if they didn’t have their ulterior motives, it wouldn’t be just to forgive them for their past crimes. \nHe realised that when he entered Postomino. \nThe new regime arrogantly advised priests to start Sunday Schools near the churches. But that can hardly be achieved when the local church was burned down during the initial raids. Postomino was near the shore, so its inhabitants and their neighbours knew first-handly the fury of hungry Vikings more than the Western Pomeranians living further from the sea. When he arrived there, Paweł disguised himself as a beggar to observe the villagers. He lived there for a few weeks. The atmosphere was tense between the local population and the Viking peacekeepers. One day, they must’ve erupted. And they did. One day, the now homeless parish priest of Postomino was severely beaten by the unknown assailants. Obviously, the pagans were blamed. Soon, an anti-Norse protest gathered in front of the police station. The Vikings surprisingly were rather defensive, but it could be explained by the numerical advantage of the protestors. Paweł was sure that the protester would turn violent. He worried that he would not be violent enough. And that, he learned time and time again, would mean death. \n- As the priest of the Catholic Church - he finally shouted - Strike them! Slay them in the name of God, before they call for a retaliatory raid. That was all the crowd needed. The wave of stone-throwing protesters swarmed the Vikings, even though the defenders opened fire and wounded some of the protesters. \n- Those involved in what happened here have to escape to the woods. We can’t win regular warfare against them - Michniewicz quickly rose to the leadership position. \nThat’s how he found himself in the ruins of the Church, praying for guidance. He was interrupted by a hand on his shoulder."

Wheras he took on activism for the democratic socialist cause best way he knew how: By disseminating industrial know-how to like-minded warlord states in fallen nations. \n\n So when he put half his life savings into machinery fit to make weapons and more machinery, and the other half to smuggling himself into Jomsborg, he expected to seed an industrial war machine to a harbinger of socialism in a nation that needed it most.\n\nInstead, he ended up in a Dark Age Viking reenactment center, gone too far.\n\nInstead of embracing technology to bring about peace and prosperity for workers of the world, the directive from the top, coming from a bearded barbarian, broad and grand in posture, flanked by two women hanging their heads down like concubines in Ottoman harem. Samael felt trapped. In place of revolution, he was bound to serve a raider economy, and instead of network-centric and coordinated force, he was made to forge last-century weaponry, both beautified in runes and rugged.\n\nIn competent hands, these weapons would do just fine. But in hands of a long-bearded mouth-breather, grunting like a Neanderthal above a comparably frail Samael as he was calibrating the metal lathe.

The chiefdom was dying, and to prevent its demise, it needed more farmers; more former Vikings ready to leave their lives of raiding and pillaging behind and settle down. \n\n- Give me the good news, Olav. Any claimants yet? \n- Not... necessarily, hersir. But we'll continue searching. Haakon still has some contacts among the Vikings. If you increase the settlers' bounty, we could try to plead our case with them. \n- Olav, it's been two months. You cannot tell me that not a single person applied. We are literally giving them free land.

Statues, runes, fulfilled lives, content peoples. Triumphant marches of conquerors. Now, without pain, he was going up. It was Adrian’s moment. Together with his brothers in arms in column, he marched through Poland renewed. With this Adrian knew, he was gonna be golden.\n\nAs the mania faded, he saw a lake, pondering what further conquests awaited him after realizing his inevitable dream. With Norns at his side, and at side of his vision, who was against him? Nothing but a humble priest, like so many that turned martyrs by Jomsborg’s axe. And then he heard himself say the words.

They unite through purpose. And then we'll have them at our gates and you berserkers will get to live out your Varangian Guard act... but make no mistake, our walls are not that of Miklagard. You'll have an easier time drinking that mead off the table, than raiding without any strategy or organisation.\n\n- The first order of business is ransoming Swen. - the young jarl retorted.\n- You mean breaking him out?! - a grizzled berserker of a jarl answered.\n- But first, we must rally...\n - and soon enough the commotion grew beyond telling the voices apart, or Zawisza's control. She was facing. Recounting mantras about men being the problem. She was egging Zandberg to organize this sorry band of glorified bandits into a real military, but she was asking herself now if they don't need a whole new leadership first...\nWHAM! - The table and everything on it shook drastically. A man of short hair and mighty beard rose, his fur shoulderwear doubling his presence. His eyes were that of what they loved the most: the icy gaze of a harsh ruler.\n- Swen... is held by an entire battalion of men. My scouts have the location and basic assessment. Any one of you is welcome to step into the henbane mist and die trying to break him out. Or, we get him out. We get organized, we embrace the chain of command, we fight as an army, a force that can not only raid but conquer. This country any other we please! Whom of you sees Cnut the Great, Harald Hardrade, as no true northmen? These men conquered nations, or died trying like real warriors. They are our way forward...\n- Christians, the lot of them. I knew your heart wasn't of the North - the old berserker scoffed, and immediately his beard was seized by Zandberg and pulled close to his face\n You can leave us right now, if you're going to call Hardrade Christian again. He was partial to Jesus, yes, but he always syncretized him alongside the Old Gods.\nHe let go of him and returned to his seat\n- They were at the dusk of the Viking age because the Viking Age could no longer cope with pressure of increasingly organised Europe. But make no mistake... their legacy lives on in them. And it will be in us. Because we won't be scattered like roaming bandits, we will prevail. Now let me show you, how we will prevail\n\nZawisza sighed in relief. Just when she lost hope, it turned out one man kept his head."

 unification.76.desc: "Years ago, back when Eurokommissariats were first created, leftist agitators and politicians were deemed a thorn in Tusk's side. Among their leaders was Adrian Zandberg, who soon went missing under suspicious circumstances. Nobody knew what happened to him afterward, yet eventually, he returned to unleash hell upon us all. His great army of socialists and Vikings invaded the western shore, smashing all liberal and fascist resistance, creating a state combining Scandinavian social democracy and Nordic paganism. Many cities belonging to neighboring cliques were soon set ablaze, bearing witness to a new way to redistribute wealth - bloody coastal raids. While definitely a brutal method, due to this stolen cash, the Folkerepublikken's citizens maintain that the Viking welfare state has truly enhanced their living standards over the times of Westpolen. Now, both capitalists and Christians are hunted down, their bodies turned into blood eagles, serving as grim examples of the madness engulfing Poland."

 POLITICS_HALFDAN_SANDBJERG_DESC: "There was a man who dreamt of a better Poland. Of social justice and equality. Of a peaceful struggle for rights and against exploitation. This man navigated carefully in the sea of politics, trying to balance the needs of people and requirements of liberal democracy. All these efforts proved to be in vain. \n\nThe EU intervention, seeming auspicious at first, brought nothing but further misery to Poland. The gates to a just, equitable European society were just as before, closed shut. Adrian Zandberg began to criticize the occupational government, and the angry masses heeded his words too eagerly. Tusk ordered his imprisonment and handed him over to some of the most despicable thugs he could foster. Zandberg never disclosed the details, but he escaped the prison as a different man. \n\nHe got to the shores of Bornholm and gazed upon the sea. He ran from beyond the sea, yes, but his origins were here, in the North. His blood boiled, his soul yearned for revenge. What good was there in the constant squabbling and striving to bring forward a civil, non-violent popular change? He was the survivor, the warrior, the Northman - a Viking. If Poland has failed to become a fair, humane country, that's too bad for Poland. \n\nSandbjerg wants to start with an axe and end with a helping hand. The redistribution of wealth can be done by force alone, and Sandbjerg draws it from many sources - starting from deranged neopagans, through disillusioned revolutionaries, ending on radicalized social democrats; whoever willing to fight will get their share. There is no simple answer to whether this is an unorthodox interpretation of socialism or simple warlordism, although time will bring an answer to that query. \n\nFor now, §0the storm is coming from the north, and the Poles are going to wither.§!"
