After his public denunciations of EKs' inner patologies and shady deals ultimately resulted in his arrest and a police raid on his house, Zandberg made  a speech on how not even the EU is able to save the failed concept that is Poland, and that in order to build a respectable state, Polish identity as a whole needs  to be replaced with a more noble, Nordic one."

Among their  leaders was Adrian Zandberg, who soon went missing under suspicious circumstances. Nobody knew what happened to him afterward, yet eventually, he returned to  unleash hell upon us all. His great army of socialists and Vikings invaded the western shore, smashing all liberal and fascist resistance, creating a state  combining Scandinavian social democracy and Nordic paganism. Many cities belonging to the neighboring cliques were soon set ablaze, bearing witness to a new way to  redistribute wealth - bloody coastal raids. While definitely a brutal method, due to this stolen cash, the Folkerepublikken's citizens maintain that this ecological  welfare state truly enhanced their living standard compared to the times of Westpolen. Now both capitalists and Christians are hunted down, their bodies turned into  blood eagles, serving as grim examples of the madness engulfing Poland."

 POLITICS_HALFDAN_SANDBJERG_DESC: "There was a man who dreamt of a better Poland. Of social justice and equality. Of a peaceful struggle for rights and against  exploitation. This man navigated carefully in the sea of politics, trying to balance the needs of people and requirements of liberal democracy. All these efforts  proved to be in vain. \n\nThe EU intervention, seeming auspicious at first, brought nothing but further misery to Poland. The gates to a just, equitable European  society were just as before, closed shut. Adrian Zandberg began to criticize the occupational government, and the angry masses heeded his words too eagerly. Tusk  ordered his imprisonment and handed him over to some of the most despicable thugs he could foster. Zandberg never disclosed the details, but he escaped the prison  as a different man. \n\nHe got to the shores of Bornholm and gazed upon the sea. He ran from beyond the sea, yes, but his origins were here, in the North. His blood  boiled, his soul yearned for revenge. What good was there in the constant squabbling and striving to bring forward a civil, non-violent popular change? He was the  survivor, the warrior, the Northman - a Viking. If Poland has failed to become a fair, humane country, that's too bad for Poland. \n\nSandbjerg wants to start with  an axe and end with a helping hand. The redistribution of wealth can be done by force alone, and Sandbjerg draws it from many sources - starting from deranged  neopagans, through disillusioned revolutionaries, ending on radicalized social democrats; whoever willing to fight will get their share. There is no simple answer  to whether this is an unorthodox interpretation of socialism or simple warlordism, although time will bring an answer to that query. \n\nFor now, §0the storm is  coming from the north, and the Poles are going to wither.§!"
