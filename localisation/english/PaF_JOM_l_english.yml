 JOM_ny_saga: "Ný Saga"
 JOM_ny_saga_desc: "Enter the story of gods and heroes, where the improbable meets the impossible, where the tale begins with an exiled man with ambitions reaching the stars. This man is destined to travel beyond the sea to meet his faith. He's going to achieve greatness, like every hero does. Of course, one can be great and venerated, as well as one can be great and feared. Alas, everyone has their dark side. And this journey shall not be an easy feat, as the inner demons and outside threats will block any rays of hope. It's a story about finding their own identity. About ordinary humans battling the giants. About a man with a fire in his eyes, who wants to revolutionize his country in ways unimaginable. This change shall come with the tides. Tides that will sweep the rotten liberalism out of the face of Midgard. This is the saga of Adrian Zandberg."
 
 JOM_folkvangr_enclave: "Fólkvangr Enclave"
 JOM_folkvangr_enclave_desc: "Far from the fjords and frozen hearths of the North, they came - those who would not kneel to foreign kings, nor abandon the gods of their fathers. Cast into exile, they carved a refuge from stone and wind, and named it Fólkvangr, after the sacred field where half of the honoured dead rest beneath Freyja's gaze.\n\nIn this strange land, the spirit of the North endures. The scent of pine smoke drifts through the air, mingling with the ring of hammers on steel. Mead is poured in hand-carved halls, sagas are recited as gospel, and children learn to carry both shield and verse.\n\nFor the day will come when the horn sounds, and Ragnarök begins."
 
 JOM_who_am_i: "Who Am I?"
 JOM_who_am_i_desc: "Halfdan Sandbjerg. Harald. Adrian Zandberg.\nThe names swirled like mist in his mind. Was he a Viking or a politician? A raider or a man of the people? A distant land called to him across the sea. Should he sail for it, sword in hand? Plunder its riches? Set its shores ablaze in glory and wrath? No... no, it was different. That land - he knew it. He remembered its rivers, its sorrows, its people. But not who he had been among them. He must help them. He must take from them. He must become... something new. But still the question burned behind his eyes, as cold as the northern wind:\n\n§RWho is he?"
 
 JOM_what_am_i_doing: "What Am I Doing?"
 JOM_what_am_i_doing_desc: "Sandbjerg’s main concern was not the cold, nor the hunger, nor even the war drums echoing in the Bornholm island. It was the question that gnawed at his soul - what was he actually doing? He was a jarl, yes. He led bloodthirsty warriors across the shattered coastlines of the Baltic, promising gold, glory, and a place in the halls of Valhalla. They drank to his name. They sang of his victories. His banners flew high over ruined towns. But as the fires burned and the ships returned heavy with spoils, doubt clung to him like salt on the wind.\nWas he truly born to raid?\nOr was there still a man, Adrian Zandberg, somewhere beneath the helm and beard?\n\nHe could not answer.\n\n§RHe could only sail forward."
 
 JOM_assembling_banners: "Assembling the Banners"
 JOM_assembling_banners_desc: "We must reclaim our land and return to the beloved embrace of beautiful Poland, shamelessly taken from us by treacherous, honorless rats. But to achieve this goal, we need people: brave, strong warriors who, under Jarl Sandbjerg's command, will reclaim what is rightfully ours. The time has come to send out the call to all refugees; the Gjallarhorn sounds, summoning them to battle. May Thor forge their hearts into those warriors who are ready to answer Odin’s call. Sandbjerg will lead us back to the soil that bore us, the land so vilely stolen from us."

 JOM_invigilaltion_from_kaupmannahofn_desc: "We miscalculated; the Danes turned out to be neither as naive nor as gullible as we had anticipated. They did not buy the tale that we are just poor refugees from a shattered homeland. Perhaps setting up a camp filled with Viking shields, banners, and weapons was not the most tactically sound way to conceal our true intentions. And now, they dare to send in inspectors, hoping to catch us red-handed. Let them try, but they will not dig us out that easily; Odin will protect us from their malicious approach to our cause. "
 
 JOM_smuggling_resources: "Smuggling Resources and Weapons"
 JOM_smuggling_resources_desc: "We already have an army, but they will not be throwing stones at the enemy or surviving on sunlight and empty promises from their commanders. We need weapons, food, and uniforms, and we cannot expect support from the Danish. Unlike the Max Kolonko Americanists, we do not have the luxury of a powerful American ally providing resources freely. We must arm and feed ourselves. While we can produce some supplies ourselves, we may need to consider resorting to the black market if necessary. If we are to survive and carve out a future worth fighting for, we must be as ruthless in logistics as we are in battle."

Gods will clash, brother against brother, and mankind shall be swept away in the fire of their fury.\n\nSo spoke the old sagas, and now it comes to pass in the shattered lands of the Eurokommissariats. Strife boils like storm-tossed seas, when the unjust lords tear at each other with iron and spite.\n\nNow is the hour foretold.\nNow we take up our axes, as our forebears did,\nAnd with steel and wrath,\nWe bring ruin to the false kings and burn their thrones to ash."

 JOM_looting_churches_desc: "Even now, after war and thunder have swept across Pomerania, the old churches remain heavy with gold. War has passed like a winter storm, but within these stone halls, wealth still clings to the shadows - chalices, reliquaries, tapestries, untouched by hunger, untouched by loss.\n\nMany wonder how such treasures stayed untouched when so much else was broken. How the altars stayed polished, while villages were burned, and children grew up with empty stomachs.\n\nAmong those who now wander through the vast coastal lands, there are whispers about the church's riches. What good is the gold serving while sealed away in tombs of faith, when the living have nothing?"

 JOM_germanic_equipment: "Germanic Equipment"
 JOM_germanic_equipment_desc: "When Ragnarök swept through the land of Pomerania, it came not with glory, but with fire, blood, and steel. The Saxon invaders, unready for the fury that fell upon them, fled before our advance. In their retreat, they left behind weapons, armour, and gear - precious tools forged for war, now claimed by our mighty Vikings. What they abandoned in fear shall now fuel our wrath. Their iron feeds our forges, their steel arms our warriors. From the ashes of their defeat, we rise stronger, guided by the will of the old gods and the unyielding north wind. "

 JOM_retake_jomsborg: "Retake Jomsborg"
 JOM_retake_jomsborg_desc: "The winds have blown us off course, and we landed where we did not intend, yet perhaps fate was kind. The shore of Bornholm that greeted us was not the one we sought, but it gave us shelter and time to gather our strength.\n\nNow, we must set our course true once more. Jomsborg must be reclaimed.\n\nThat isle is no mere rock in the sea; it is sacred land, soaked in the blood and honor of our ancestors. It is where the runes were first carved into stone, and where Thor’s hammer shielded the free folk against tyrants. Jomsborg is the heart of our saga, and it shall beat once more. "

 JOM_northern_flank: "Northern Flank"
 JOM_northern_flank_desc: "We can see Jomsborg right in front of us. Our Viking spirit urges us to strike immediately, without considering the potential dangers. However, it would be unwise to assault an area where we are already expected; there will be many future opportunities to prove ourselves worthy of a place in Valhalla. The best strategy is to approach from the North by capturing the city of Dziwnów, which will confuse our enemies who are prepared for a frontal attack on their positions. Although we will have to travel some distance, with Odin's strength on our side, it will be worth it."

 JOM_direct_strike: "Direct Strike at the City"
 JOM_direct_strike_desc: "To Helheim with that! Who needs strategy when the blood of berserkers boils in our veins? Our warriors will tear through the dissenters like wolves through sheep. Let them cower behind their walls; it will not save them. Jomsborg lies just beyond the river, close enough to taste their fear.\n\nWhat force could ever stop us? It is our birthright, our sacred ground. We shall take it not with caution, but with fury, steel, and the thunderous roar of unchained warriors. Let the earth shake beneath our boots, Jomsborg will fall by dawn."

 JOM_back_in_home: "Back in Our Ancestral Home"
 JOM_back_in_home_desc: "Our sacred city has been retaken from the Wends, and at long last, we can walk its grounds not as strangers, but as heirs. The festival fires are lit once more, and the banners of our forefathers rise high above the old burial mounds. We may now visit the tomb of Harald Bluetooth without shame, speak the names of our ancestors aloud, and feel the spirits stir. Let the drums thunder and the horns sound across the hills, Jomsborg is ours again. Let no enemy set foot here again, for now and always, it stands as a beacon of the North reborn."

 JOM_memories_of_past: "Memories of the Past"
 JOM_memories_of_past_desc: "Our jarl, Halfdan Sandbjerg, walks these fertile lands with pride, but shadows linger around him. Whispers among the people suggest that he was once imprisoned by the Germans, tormented by their ruthless regime. It is said that the iron forged in that suffering shaped the mighty warrior we follow today, a man who was broken, reforged, and set free upon the world. His fury led us to victory, and his vision carved our path through ice and fire. However, some fear that ghosts of his past are stirring again, that old pain gnaws at his heart, and buried truths claw their way to the surface from the dark. Let us pray that the gods fortify his spirit before it shatters."

 JOM_tyr_chosen_desc: "Our warriors march under the blessing of Tyr himself, the god of war. With such divine favour upon them, they shall stand unbroken against the greatest beasts the land of the Wends can summon. No fang nor steel shall shake their shield-wall. Their hearts beat to the rhythm of old sagas, and their blades carry the weight of righteous fury. Let the enemy send giants, let the earth split and roar - the sons of the North shall not yield. They fight not only for victory, but for glory, for memory, and for the eternal place in Valhalla."

 JOM_fury_of_berserkers: "Fury of the Berserkers"
 JOM_fury_of_berserkers_desc: "When Thor called them to battle, they did not hesitate. For them, honour was victory, and nothing held meaning but the spilled blood of foes and the pride of their shield-brothers, who fought not for gold nor glory, but to live free beneath open skies.\n\nAnd when darkness fell upon the earth, when silence crept among the cold and still forms of the fallen, they knelt. With bloodied hands and weary breath, they gave thanks to the gods, for sacred might, for unyielding spirit, and for the strength to stand while others fell. Their song was not of sorrow; it was for struggle, for survival, for the fire that burned within them still."

 JOM_forging_spears: "Forging the Spears and Axes"
 JOM_forging_spears_desc: "Our strongest berserkers could rip a Wend apart with their bare hands, as wolves tear flesh from a bone. But not all warriors carry such fury in their veins. Many still need steel - not for fear, but for honour, for the joy of battle, and for the weight of a blade in hand.\n\nThe forges of the old world are cold and lifeless, and not many factories remain to feed our Viking might. So we turn to the ways of our ancestors. In the smoke of village smithies, beneath hammers and fire, we shall shape our weapons anew, axeheads from scrap, and blades from iron."

 JOM_shields_from_vendland: "Shieldmaidens of Vendland"
 JOM_shields_from_vendland_desc: "Our shieldmaidens stand equal to the fiercest berserkers. With fire in their hearts and steel in their hands, they fight with the same unyielding courage and grim resolve as any warrior of the North. The gods see no difference in blood spilled for honour, and neither shall we.\n\nNo one should question their place. They have earned the right to stand in the shieldwall, to swing axe and sword, and to carve their path to Valhalla with fury and pride. The shieldbearers, our daughters, sisters, and mothers, shall be the unshaken backbone of our war effort. In battle, they are not women. They are wolves. "

 JOM_shield_wall_perfected: "Shield Wall Perfected"
 JOM_shield_wall_perfected_desc: "The shield wall doctrine, used in every battle, is highly effective. However, a modern adaptation could enhance our war efforts to the point where every man and woman in Pomerania would fear our horns and thirst for battle. By refining our tactics and adapting them for the modern battlefield, we can unleash a war machine that is rooted in tradition yet sharpened by necessity. Mastery on the battlefield will not only lead us to victory but also make Odin and the other gods proud. Dying in battle is the greatest honor, but fighting for our future and our offspring is the sacred duty that binds us to both our past and our destiny."

 JOM_cutting_trees_for_fleet: "Clearing Forests for Ships"
 JOM_cutting_trees_for_fleet_desc: "Along the western shores of Pomerania lie vast, ancient forests - deep and sacred, but their time has come. If we are to raise the great fleet we swore to the gods and our ancestors, the trees must fall. There can be no mercy, only axe and flame.\n\nOne hundred drakkars were promised - longships to carry us across the waters, back to the land of Western Pomerania. To reclaim and fulfil the saga written in our blood and history. The forests shall feed the forges, the shipyards shall thunder with toil, and from the roots of Midgard itself shall rise the legendary fleet that would make the Gods proud. "

 JOM_hit_run_doctrine: "Hit-and-Run Raids Doctrine"
 JOM_hit_run_doctrine_desc: "The strength of our kin has always been in the storm we bring - sudden, fierce, and gone before the dust can settle. We strike like thunder from a clear sky, with no warning, no mercy. One moment, the land is quiet; the next, the clash of steel, the roar of warriors, and fire licking the heavens.\n\nWe raid swiftly and vanish even swifter. While our foes scramble to understand what has happened, we are far away, sails full, laughing with the wind. And when they think they are safe again... we return, in another place, at another time, with the same fury."

 JOM_riverine_warfare: "Riverine Warfare"
 JOM_riverine_warfare_desc: "Langskips of every kind were crafted with such fierce brilliance that they could sail not only the vast, raging seas, but even reach the gods-forsaken shores of far-off Vinland, and glide just as easily through narrow fjords and winding rivers. Their hulls were built for both ocean wrath and inland cunning.\n\nThe Baltic lies behind us now, its waves conquered and forgotten. But ahead... ahead lies a land split by rivers, winding like serpents through the heart of our destiny. And just as before, our longships shall bear us forward, swift and silent, as axes bear down upon the necks of kings."

 JOM_fjm_karl_marx: "FJM Karl Marx"
 JOM_fjm_karl_marx_desc: "Our warband stands strong, an unbroken host of mighty Vikings, ready to seize the winding rivers of Pomerania with our fleet of proud drakkars. However, we are missing something. A longship worthy of sagas yet to be sung, leading our fleet like Fenrir at the head of the storm. We shall forge a vessel the likes of which Midgard has never seen, the mightiest drakkar ever carved from timber and iron. Named after the biggest advocate of basic workers' rights, Karl Marx, the vessel will make even Tyr himself proud. Let the rivers tremble beneath its keel."

 JOM_friggs_care: "Frigg's Care"
 JOM_friggs_care_desc: "Those who can no longer lift an axe or a shield shall never be cast aside. They are the hearth-keepers, the wisdom-bearers - the backbone of our tribe. It is they who raise the next generation of shieldmaidens and berserkers, who keep the fires burning when the warband marches to distant shores.\n\nLet none forget their sacrifice, for it is written in both scar and deed. And may Frigg, wise and gentle, bless them with strength and peace, so that when the horns fall silent and the swords are sheathed, we have a home worthy of our triumphs, and a people still standing to welcome us back."

 JOM_redistribute_loot: "Redistribution of Loot"
 JOM_redistribute_loot_desc: "The spoils of battle are not only for the Jarls. What our warriors seize with axe and fire must be shared with the folk. Let every man, woman, and child taste the fruits of our raids. When gold flows to all, no quarrels arise over how it was won. Thus, we stay strong, bound by blood, honour, and shared purpose. A true Viking victory is not measured by what one man takes, but by the feasting of the whole clan. Our strength is not only in the fury of the berserker, but in the bond of the shield wall and the unity of our people. That is how we shall endure."

 JOM_of_fish_and_mead: "Of Fish and Mead"
 JOM_of_fish_and_mead_desc: "The Viking diet was simple and harsh, shaped by the cold lands and the struggle to grow crops in the stony soil of the North.\n\nNow, we find ourselves in a similar plight. Until better days come, until the next harvest season, we must endure as our ancestors did: living off the fish of the sea, the honey from our hives, and whatever roots, berries, or wild herbs we can gather.\n\nIt may not be a feast fit for the gods, but it shall be enough to keep us strong, proud, and ready for the battles ahead."

 JOM_free_thralls: "Free the Thralls"
 JOM_free_thralls_desc: "The Vikings of old held an ambivalent view of slavery... but we shall not bear such a stain. Though we wear the furs and wield the axes of our ancestors, we care about the oppressed. We are not conquerors alone; we are a liberation army.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must march upon the reeducation camps across the former lands of the Eurokommissariats. We shall break their gates, tear down their fences, and set free every soul within. Political prisoners, forced laborers, and all those chained by the German yoke shall walk free again."

 JOM_power_of_njoar: "Power of Njörðr"
 JOM_power_of_njoar_desc: "Njörðr, warden of wind and wave, shall be the one to whom we offer our toil. As he calms storms and guides ships to safe shores, so too shall he guide our hands as we harness the breath of the sea and the song of the skies.\n\nLet the windmills turn in his name, and the waters flow with his blessing. May his favor bring us warmth in the frostbitten dark and light in the long winter nights. In his might, we shall not burn forests nor dig deep into the bones of the earth, but rise with the power of nature itself, as true sons and daughters of the North."

 JOM_establish_trades_routes: "Establish the Sea Trades Routes"
 JOM_establish_trades_routes_desc: "The sea is a gift from the gods, and it offers us more than just an escape from the madness ashore. Aye, we could raise our sails and vanish into the horizon, leaving the land of the Wends behind in smoke and ruin, but there is greater glory to achieve.\n\nWith wind at our backs and Njordr’s blessing, we shall begin to trade, modest at first - small ships, scattered goods. But in time, our voyages shall become the sole lifeline between the world and this shattered coast. Then it will be we who name the price. Riches shall flow to those bold enough to brave the waves, and no one braves them like the sons and daughters of the North."

 jomsborg.3.desc: "Every few days, more news about EKW's downfall reach us. Today's news, however, have been... quite unorthodox. Apparently, Pomeranian regional  media are informing about... a Viking raid on Kamień Pomorski. \n\nThe norsemen were led by Adrian Zandberg (apparently referred to as Halfdan Sandbjerg by his  men), whom it looks like have finally returned back to the country after his exodus to Bornholm following the conflict between him and the Eurokommissariat's  government. After his public denunciations of EKs' inner patologies and shady deals ultimately resulted in his arrest and a police raid on his house, Zandberg made  a speech on how not even the EU is able to save the failed concept that is Poland, and that in order to build a respectable state, Polish identity as a whole needs  to be replaced with a more noble, Nordic one."

 jomsborg.5.t: "In the Hall of the Carmine Jarl"
 jomsborg.5.desc: "Far away from all the chaos of the European mainland, surrounded by the cold and tempestuous waters of the Baltic, a Danish island of Bornholm had its place. It's a calm and peaceful islet where life goes on slowly, away from busy center of Denmark. In their bliss, or maybe ignorance and blind trust, the islanders of Bornholm gave refuge to a group of refugees from Poland. Plenty of time has passed since the European intervention took place and numerous boats disembarked upon beaches near Svaneke. Locals, at first somewhat concerned, have eased their tense outlook after the leader of the Poles - Adrian Zandberg greeted them in their native Danish tounge, despite the welcoming speech being simple and very rusty. \n \n To not cause any trouble, the refuges formed a small commune just outside the town, building wooden huts out of any scraps they could scrounge up. As months passed the settlement grew in size, soon named Folkvangr, after the mythical refuge for fallen warriors ruled by goddess Freyja. Entirety of the village centered itself around the longhouse built out of discarded shipping containers - Sessrúmnir, where the Carmine Jarl held his meetings, and after dark planned his grand return. With a growing population soon came a need for a blacksmith, fishermen, shipwrights and traders who knew at least three words in Danish. Albeit small and desolate, the village of Folkvangr held an indominable spirit of determination, as each evening, when the sun set, the villagers gathered around the campfire to sing tales of the old lands, the ones stolen from them, and the ones they will take back. \n \n With time, the viking spirit started to spread throughout the community, as they all gravitated to the wise, yet sometimes unstable leader. As his mental strain increased, no doubt caused by years of unsuccessful attempts of peacefully taking over and improving the state of Poland, soon cracks started to show. The new identity of Halfdan Sandbjerg took root in the cracks of his mind, a stern viking high chief who would not bend a knee to anyone was needed to unite his broken, but faithful warriors and bring them back into glorious warfare against western invaders. \n \n With his personality shifted, a Great Temple of Odin was raised beside the longhouse, where Gothis appointed by him would lead ceremonies in the name of the Allfather. The adamant high chief Sandbjerg now looks upon his fledging settlement of lost but faithful souls, as he stands upon a hill, watching yet another drakkar take shape in the \"shipyard\". Soon the Viking warriors of Folkvangr shall sail south, and write a saga worthy of Valhalla!"

But the gods are silent. They might as well be dead. \n\n - No mortal man can bear the weight of the millions... Face the Fenrir and the Jormungandr... But you, Harald? What about you?

 jomsborg.8.t: "Odin's Ravens are watching"
 jomsborg.8.desc: "Quiet skies above Bornholm, normally cloudy and peaceful, were broken by loud juddering of a helicopter. Rotor blades slashed through the morning fog as the Danish Royal Coast Guard aircraft made its way towards the anomalous settlement on the Eastern coast of the Island. Aboard it, sat Mikkel Rasmunsen, deputy officer of Capital Region Administration, a person not important enough to hold a position in the Copenhagen council, yet important enough to be sent out to investigate reports about a weird village somewhere in the Baltic backwaters of the Kingdom. He sat in the back of a Coast Guard helicopter with a folder full of wild descriptions of a \"wild Norsemen LARP Group\" setting up a permanent settlement outside Sveneke in one hand, and his temples in another. He cursed to himself that this is not what he spent years on best Copenhagen universities for. Soon however his angry meditation was interrupted by the pilot. \n \n - Deputy, sir, we're almost there. \n \n Looking outside the window, his eyes widened and eyebrows lifted high. Reports weren't exaggarated, it truly was a ragtag group of Viking LARPers living in a real norse temple tribe, however crude. The arrival of a \"shrieking silver bird\" caused quite a commotion in the village, as both men, women and children crowded outside their wood-mud huts pointing, waving and cowering before the \"monster\". \n \n - Put us down, I need to see this up close. - Mikkel spoke, in a feat of bewildered curiosity. \n - Yes, sir. - Pilot responded, proceeding to set down the helicopter upon an empty field nearby the village. \n \n As the rotors kicked up clouds of dust around the landing site, nearly all wildly infatuated villagers surrounded the aircraft, some bearing crude, rusty axes in their shaking hands. Mikkel opened the sliding side door as soon as the helicopter's wheels touched the ground, holding onto his folder tightly. Women and children shouted in fear, as the man in black exited the \"bird's belly\". The Danish deputy truly looked out of place in his suit, surrounded by unshaven Viking cosplayers covered in blankets and ripped up carpets. The remaining bravest of the men formed a shaking shield wall formation, and braced for a fight. Thankfully before anything bad happened, a tall and burly man emerged from the formation, other warriors cowered before him in respect. \n \n - Vælkomin outsider! - his boomy voice echoed around as he spread his arms in welcome, speaking very crude Danish. - Allfather be praised, messenger of Huginn and Muninn, I welcome you to Folkvangr! \n \n The atmosphere surrounding the landing site eased quickly, as shields and axes were lowered. Mikkel stood quite shocked, but quickly snapped back, fixed his suit and approached the Jarl who bore a long Carmine cape. Chief of the tribe was nearly elated, that his actions brought the attention of Odin's Ravens, as he led the deputy towards the longhouse in the center of the village. Mikkel reckoned, it would be in his best interest to simply play along and report what he saw afterwards."

 jomsborg.26.desc: "At the crossing of three roads, dozens of huskarls and shieldmaidens had gathered. Standing in a wide circle, they shouted and cursed, their voices rising louder than the crashing of the nearby sea. At the center of their scorn stood a gaunt figure clad in a tattered uniform - Aleksander Jabłonowski. Wojciech Olszański as was his true name. Lizard as he was called by his enemies and some “friends”. Though wearied by years of war and wandering, he stood tall, clinging to what pride he still possessed. In one hand he held a nicked sword, in the other, a weathered leather shield. He said nothing, lost in the memory of battles - those fought before the cameras, and those waged in forests and scorched villages. Then a great roar thundered through the air, silencing the crowd. The silence was broken only by the slow, heavy beat of footsteps. Into the ring stepped Halfdan, taller than any man, clad in the hide of a bear, an axe in each hand. Beside him walked his retainer, who stopped between the two warriors, unrolled a scroll, and read aloud:\n\n- Wojciech Olszański, you have been challenged to holmgang by Halfdan Sandbjerg, for evil deeds done against the people of Wendland and the republic they held dear. You shall fight with chosen weapons. Broken shields may not be replaced. The duel ends in death, and the victor shall claim the spoils of the fallen.\n\nWith that, the warriors stepped closer, face to face, waiting for the Norse herald to leave the circle. The Dane struck first, swinging from above, but Wojciech caught the blow on his shield and countered with a slash from the right. Halfdan leapt aside and struck again, another downward blow, again blocked. The crowd howled anew, hurling curses at the one called out.\nWojciech thrust his blade forward, but Halfdan stepped back, caught the sword between the haft and blade of his axe, and wrenched it free, hurling it to the edge of the ring. So fierce was the move that Halfdan stumbled, unbalanced, leaving his guard open. Olszański seized the moment - he swung, and with all his fury, smashed the shield into the Dane's head. Halfdan staggered backward, dazed.\n\nSeeing his foe charge, Lizard surged forward - but the Dane, now enraged, charged as well, raining blows upon the already-weak shield. Wojciech heard the wood split - a terrible crack - and then he was on the ground, beneath the towering Viking. Halfdan cast aside his axes. He leapt onto his foe, striking his head again.\nAnd again. And again. And again.\nThen - silence.\n\nAnd Wojciech found himself upon a green meadow, beneath a sky untouched by smoke.\nAround him stood his comrades.\nAnd his wife.\nHis kin."

 unification.76.t: "[GetNewspaper]Folkerepublikken Jomsborg conquers West Pomerania!"
 unification.76.desc: "Years ago, back when Eurokommissariats were first created, leftist agitators and politicians were deemed a thorn in Tusk's side. Among their  leaders was Adrian Zandberg, who soon went missing under suspicious circumstances. Nobody knew what happened to him afterward, yet eventually, he returned to  unleash hell upon us all. His great army of socialists and Vikings invaded the western shore, smashing all liberal and fascist resistance, creating a state  combining Scandinavian social democracy and Nordic paganism. Many cities belonging to the neighboring cliques were soon set ablaze, bearing witness to a new way to  redistribute wealth - bloody coastal raids. While definitely a brutal method, due to this stolen cash, the Folkerepublikken's citizens maintain that this ecological  welfare state truly enhanced their living standard compared to the times of Westpolen. Now both capitalists and Christians are hunted down, their bodies turned into  blood eagles, serving as grim examples of the madness engulfing Poland."

 POLITICS_HALFDAN_SANDBJERG_DESC: "There was a man who dreamt of a better Poland. Of social justice and equality. Of a peaceful struggle for rights and against  exploitation. This man navigated carefully in the sea of politics, trying to balance the needs of people and requirements of liberal democracy. All these efforts  proved to be in vain. \n\nThe EU intervention, seeming auspicious at first, brought nothing but further misery to Poland. The gates to a just, equitable European  society were just as before, closed shut. Adrian Zandberg began to criticize the occupational government, and the angry masses heeded his words too eagerly. Tusk  ordered his imprisonment and handed him over to some of the most despicable thugs he could foster. Zandberg never disclosed the details, but he escaped the prison  as a different man. \n\nHe got to the shores of Bornholm and gazed upon the sea. He ran from beyond the sea, yes, but his origins were here, in the North. His blood  boiled, his soul yearned for revenge. What good was there in the constant squabbling and striving to bring forward a civil, non-violent popular change? He was the  survivor, the warrior, the Northman - a Viking. If Poland has failed to become a fair, humane country, that's too bad for Poland. \n\nSandbjerg wants to start with  an axe and end with a helping hand. The redistribution of wealth can be done by force alone, and Sandbjerg draws it from many sources - starting from deranged  neopagans, through disillusioned revolutionaries, ending on radicalized social democrats; whoever willing to fight will get their share. There is no simple answer  to whether this is an unorthodox interpretation of socialism or simple warlordism, although time will bring an answer to that query. \n\nFor now, §0the storm is  coming from the north, and the Poles are going to wither.§!"
