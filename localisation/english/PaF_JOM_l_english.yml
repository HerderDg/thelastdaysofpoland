jomsborg.3.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]A Viking Invasion?!"
jomsborg.3.desc:0 "Every few days, more news about EKW's downfall reach us. Today's news, however, have been... quite unorthodox. Apparently, Pomeranian regional media are informing about... a Viking raid on Kamień Pomorski. \n\nThe norsemen were led by Adrian Zandberg (apparently referred to as Halfdan Sandbjerg by his men), whom it looks like finally returned back to the country after his exodus to Bornholm following the conflict between him and the Eurokommissariat's government. After his public denunciations of EKs' inner patologies and shady deals ultimately resulted in his arrest and a police raid on his house, Zandberg made a speech on how not even the EU is able to save the failed concept that is Poland, and that in order to build a respectable state, Polish identity as a whole needs to be replaced with a more noble, Nordic one."

POLITICS_HALFDAN_SANDBJERG_DESC:0 "There was a man who dreamt of better Poland. Of social justice and equality. Of a peaceful struggle for rights and agains exploitation. This man navigated carefully in the sea of politics, trying to balance the needs of people and requirements of liberal democracy. All these efforts proved in vain. \n\nThe UE intervention, seeming auspicious at first, brought nothing but further misery to Poland. The gates to a just, equitable, European society were, just as before, closed shut. Adrian Zandberg begun to criticise the occupational government, and the angry massess heeded his words too eagerly. Tusk ordered his inprisonment and handed him over to some of most despicable thugs he could foster. Zandberg never disclosed the details, but he escaped the prison as a different man. \n\nHe got to the shores of Bornholm and gazed upon the sea. He ran from beyond the sea, yes, but his orgins were here, in the North. His blood boiled, his soul yearned for revenge. What good was there in the constant squabbling and striving to bring forward a civil, non-violent popular change? He was the survivor, the warrior, the Northman - a Viking. If Poland has failed to become a fair, humane country, that's too bad for Poland. \n\nSandbjerg wants to start with an axe and end with a helping hand. The redistribution of wealth can be done by force alone, and Sandbjerg draws it from many sources - starting from deranged neopagans, through disillusioned revolutionaries, ending on radicalised socialdemocrats. Whoever willing to fight will get their share. There is no simple answer whether this is an unorthodox interpretation of socialism or simple warlordism, although time will bring an answer to that. \n\nFor now, §0the storm is coming from the north, and the Poles are going to wither.§!"
