Apparently, Pomeranian regional  media are informing about... a Viking raid on Kamień Pomorski. \n\nThe norsemen were led by Adrian Zandberg (apparently referred to as Halfdan Sandbjerg by his  men), whom it looks like have finally returned back to the country after his exodus to Bornholm following the conflict between him and the Eurokommissariat's  government. After his public denunciations of EKs' inner patologies and shady deals ultimately resulted in his arrest and a police raid on his house, Zandberg made  a speech on how not even the EU is able to save the failed concept that is Poland, and that in order to build a respectable state, Polish identity as a whole needs  to be replaced with a more noble, Nordic one."

 jomsborg.5.t: "In the Hall of the Carmine Jarl"
 jomsborg.5.desc: "Far away from all the chaos of the European mainland, surrounded by the cold and tempestuous waters of the Baltic, a Danish island of Bornholm had its place. It's a calm and peaceful islet where life goes on slowly, away from busy center of Denmark. In their bliss, or maybe ignorance and blind trust, the islanders of Bornholm gave refuge to a group of refugees from Poland. Plenty of time has passed since the European intervention took place and numerous boats disembarked upon beaches near Svaneke. Locals, at first somewhat concerned, have eased their tense outlook after the leader of the Poles - Adrian Zandberg greeted them in their native Danish tounge, despite the welcoming speech being simple and very rusty. \n \n To not cause any trouble, the refuges formed a small commune just outside the town, building wooden huts out of any scraps they could scrounge up. As months passed the settlement grew in size, soon named Folkvangr, after the mythical refuge for fallen warriors ruled by goddess Freyja. Entirety of the village centered itself around the longhouse built out of discarded shipping containers - Sessrúmnir, where the Carmine Jarl held his meetings, and after dark planned his grand return. With a growing population soon came a need for a blacksmith, fishermen, shipwrights and traders who knew at least three words in Danish. Albeit small and desolate, the village of Folkvangr held an indominable spirit of determination, as each evening, when the sun set, the villagers gathered around the campfire to sing tales of the old lands, the ones stolen from them, and the ones they will take back. \n \n With time, the viking spirit started to spread throughout the community, as they all gravitated to the wise, yet sometimes unstable leader. As his mental strain increased, no doubt caused by years of unsuccessful attempts of peacefully taking over and improving the state of Poland, soon cracks started to show. The new identity of Halfdan Sandbjerg took root in the cracks of his mind, a stern viking high chief who would not bend a knee to anyone was needed to unite his broken, but faithful warriors and bring them back into glorious warfare against western invaders. \n \n With his personality shifted, a Great Temple of Odin was raised beside the longhouse, where Gothis appointed by him would lead ceremonies in the name of the Allfather. The adamant high chief Sandbjerg now looks upon his fledging settlement of lost but faithful souls, as he stands upon a hill, watching yet another drakkar take shape in the \"shipyard\". Soon the Viking warriors of Folkvangr shall sail south, and write a saga worthy of Valhalla!"

 jomsborg.8.t: "Odin's Ravens are watching"
 jomsborg.8.desc: "Quiet skies above Bornholm, normally cloudy and peaceful, were broken by loud juddering of a helicopter. Rotor blades slashed through the morning fog as the Danish Royal Coast Guard aircraft made its way towards the anomalous settlement on the Eastern coast of the Island. Aboard it, sat Mikkel Rasmunsen, deputy officer of Capital Region Administration, a person not important enough to hold a position in the Copenhagen council, yet important enough to be sent out to investigate reports about a weird village somewhere in the Baltic backwaters of the Kingdom. He sat in the back of a Coast Guard helicopter with a folder full of wild descriptions of a \"wild Norsemen LARP Group\" setting up a permanent settlement outside Sveneke in one hand, and his temples in another. He cursed to himself that this is not what he spent years on best Copenhagen universities for. Soon however his angry meditation was interrupted by the pilot. \n \n - Deputy, sir, we're almost there. \n \n Looking outside the window, his eyes widened and eyebrows lifted high. Reports weren't exaggarated, it truly was a ragtag group of Viking LARPers living in a real norse temple tribe, however crude. The arrival of a \"shrieking silver bird\" caused quite a commotion in the village, as both men, women and children crowded outside their wood-mud huts pointing, waving and cowering before the \"monster\". \n \n - Put us down, I need to see this up close. - Mikkel spoke, in a feat of bewildered curiosity. \n - Yes, sir. - Pilot responded, proceeding to set down the helicopter upon an empty field nearby the village. \n \n As the rotors kicked up clouds of dust around the landing site, nearly all wildly infatuated villagers surrounded the aircraft, some bearing crude, rusty axes in their shaking hands. Mikkel opened the sliding side door as soon as the helicopter's wheels touched the ground, holding onto his folder tightly. Women and children shouted in fear, as the man in black exited the \"bird's belly\". The Danish deputy truly looked out of place in his suit, surrounded by unshaven Viking cosplayers covered in blankets and ripped up carpets. The remaining bravest of the men formed a shaking shield wall formation, and braced for a fight. Thankfully before anything bad happened, a tall and burly man emerged from the formation, other warriors cowered before him in respect. \n \n - Vælkomin outsider! - his boomy voice echoed around as he spread his arms in welcome, speaking very crude Danish. - Allfather be praised, messenger of Huginn and Muninn, I welcome you to Folkvangr! \n \n The atmosphere surrounding the landing site eased quickly, as shields and axes were lowered. Mikkel stood quite shocked, but quickly snapped back, fixed his suit and approached the Jarl who bore a long Carmine cape. Chief of the tribe was nearly elated, that his actions brought the attention of Odin's Ravens, as he led the deputy towards the longhouse in the center of the village. Mikkel reckoned, it would be in his best interest to simply play along and report what he saw afterwards."

 unification.76.desc: "Years ago, back when Eurokommissariats were first created, leftist agitators and politicians were deemed a thorn in Tusk's side. Among their  leaders was Adrian Zandberg, who soon went missing under suspicious circumstances. Nobody knew what happened to him afterward, yet eventually, he returned to  unleash hell upon us all. His great army of socialists and Vikings invaded the western shore, smashing all liberal and fascist resistance, creating a state  combining Scandinavian social democracy and Nordic paganism. Many cities belonging to the neighboring cliques were soon set ablaze, bearing witness to a new way to  redistribute wealth - bloody coastal raids. While definitely a brutal method, due to this stolen cash, the Folkerepublikken's citizens maintain that this ecological  welfare state truly enhanced their living standard compared to the times of Westpolen. Now both capitalists and Christians are hunted down, their bodies turned into  blood eagles, serving as grim examples of the madness engulfing Poland."

 POLITICS_HALFDAN_SANDBJERG_DESC: "There was a man who dreamt of a better Poland. Of social justice and equality. Of a peaceful struggle for rights and against  exploitation. This man navigated carefully in the sea of politics, trying to balance the needs of people and requirements of liberal democracy. All these efforts  proved to be in vain. \n\nThe EU intervention, seeming auspicious at first, brought nothing but further misery to Poland. The gates to a just, equitable European  society were just as before, closed shut. Adrian Zandberg began to criticize the occupational government, and the angry masses heeded his words too eagerly. Tusk  ordered his imprisonment and handed him over to some of the most despicable thugs he could foster. Zandberg never disclosed the details, but he escaped the prison  as a different man. \n\nHe got to the shores of Bornholm and gazed upon the sea. He ran from beyond the sea, yes, but his origins were here, in the North. His blood  boiled, his soul yearned for revenge. What good was there in the constant squabbling and striving to bring forward a civil, non-violent popular change? He was the  survivor, the warrior, the Northman - a Viking. If Poland has failed to become a fair, humane country, that's too bad for Poland. \n\nSandbjerg wants to start with  an axe and end with a helping hand. The redistribution of wealth can be done by force alone, and Sandbjerg draws it from many sources - starting from deranged  neopagans, through disillusioned revolutionaries, ending on radicalized social democrats; whoever willing to fight will get their share. There is no simple answer  to whether this is an unorthodox interpretation of socialism or simple warlordism, although time will bring an answer to that query. \n\nFor now, §0the storm is  coming from the north, and the Poles are going to wither.§!"
