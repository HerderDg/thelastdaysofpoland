 JOM_ny_saga: "Ný Saga"
 JOM_ny_saga_desc: "Enter the story of gods and heroes, where the improbable meets the impossible, where the tale begins with an exiled man with ambitions reaching the stars. This man is destined to travel beyond the sea to meet his faith. He's going to achieve greatness, like every hero does. Of course, one can be great and venerated, as well as one can be great and feared. Alas, everyone has their dark side. And this journey shall not be an easy feat, as the inner demons and outside threats will block any rays of hope. It's a story about finding their own identity. About ordinary humans battling the giants. About a man with a fire in his eyes, who wants to revolutionize his country in ways unimaginable. This change shall come with the tides. Tides that will sweep the rotten liberalism out of the face of Midgard. This is the saga of Adrian Zandberg."
 
 JOM_folkvangr_enclave: "Fólkvangr Enclave"
 JOM_folkvangr_enclave_desc: "Far from the fjords and frozen hearths of the North, they came - those who would not kneel to foreign kings, nor abandon the gods of their fathers. Cast into exile, they carved a refuge from stone and wind, and named it Fólkvangr, after the sacred field where half of the honoured dead rest beneath Freyja's gaze.\n\nIn this strange land, the spirit of the North endures. The scent of pine smoke drifts through the air, mingling with the ring of hammers on steel. Mead is poured in hand-carved halls, sagas are recited as gospel, and children learn to carry both shield and verse.\n\nFor the day will come when the horn sounds, and Ragnarök begins."
 
 JOM_who_am_i: "Who Am I?"
 JOM_who_am_i_desc: "Halfdan Sandbjerg. Harald. Adrian Zandberg.\nThe names swirled like mist in his mind. Was he a Viking or a politician? A raider or a man of the people? A distant land called to him across the sea. Should he sail for it, sword in hand? Plunder its riches? Set its shores ablaze in glory and wrath? No... no, it was different. That land - he knew it. He remembered its rivers, its sorrows, its people. But not who he had been among them. He must help them. He must take from them. He must become... something new. But still the question burned behind his eyes, as cold as the northern wind:\n\n§RWho is he?"
 
 JOM_what_am_i_doing: "What Am I Doing?"
 JOM_what_am_i_doing_desc: "Sandbjerg's main concern was not the cold, nor the hunger, nor even the war drums echoing in the Bornholm island. It was the question that gnawed at his soul - what was he actually doing? He was a jarl, yes. He led bloodthirsty warriors across the shattered coastlines of the Baltic, promising gold, glory, and a place in the halls of Valhalla. They drank to his name. They sang of his victories. His banners flew high over ruined towns. But as the fires burned and the ships returned heavy with spoils, doubt clung to him like salt on the wind.\nWas he truly born to raid?\nOr was there still a man, Adrian Zandberg, somewhere beneath the helm and beard?\n\nHe could not answer.\n\n§RHe could only sail forward."
 
 JOM_assembling_banners: "Assembling the Banners"
 JOM_assembling_banners_desc: "We must reclaim our land and return to the beloved embrace of beautiful Poland, shamelessly taken from us by treacherous, honorless rats. But to achieve this goal, we need people: brave, strong warriors who, under Jarl Sandbjerg's command, will reclaim what is rightfully ours. The time has come to send out the call to all refugees; the Gjallarhorn sounds, summoning them to battle. May Thor forge their hearts into those warriors who are ready to answer Odin's call. Sandbjerg will lead us back to the soil that bore us, the land so vilely stolen from us."

 JOM_invigilaltion_from_kaupmannahofn_desc: "We miscalculated; the Danes turned out to be neither as naive nor as gullible as we had anticipated. They did not buy the tale that we are just poor refugees from a shattered homeland. Perhaps setting up a camp filled with Viking shields, banners, and weapons was not the most tactically sound way to conceal our true intentions. And now, they dare to send in inspectors, hoping to catch us red-handed. Let them try, but they will not dig us out that easily; Odin will protect us from their malicious approach to our cause. "
 
 JOM_smuggling_resources: "Smuggling Resources and Weapons"
 JOM_smuggling_resources_desc: "We already have an army, but they will not be throwing stones at the enemy or surviving on sunlight and empty promises from their commanders. We need weapons, food, and uniforms, and we cannot expect support from the Danish. Unlike the Max Kolonko Americanists, we do not have the luxury of a powerful American ally providing resources freely. We must arm and feed ourselves. While we can produce some supplies ourselves, we may need to consider resorting to the black market if necessary. If we are to survive and carve out a future worth fighting for, we must be as ruthless in logistics as we are in battle."

Gods will clash, brother against brother, and mankind shall be swept away in the fire of their fury.\n\nSo spoke the old sagas, and now it comes to pass in the shattered lands of the Eurokommissariats. Strife boils like storm-tossed seas, when the unjust lords tear at each other with iron and spite.\n\nNow is the hour foretold.\nNow we take up our axes, as our forebears did,\nAnd with steel and wrath,\nWe bring ruin to the false kings and burn their thrones to ash."

War has passed like a winter storm, but within these stone halls, wealth still clings to the shadows - chalices, reliquaries, tapestries, untouched by hunger, untouched by loss.\n\nMany wonder how such treasures stayed untouched when so much else was broken. How the altars stayed polished, while villages were burned, and children grew up with empty stomachs.\n\nAmong those who now wander through the vast coastal lands, there are whispers about the church's riches. What good is the gold serving while sealed away in tombs of faith, when the living have nothing?"

 JOM_germanic_equipment: "Germanic Equipment"
 JOM_germanic_equipment_desc: "When Ragnarök swept through the land of Pomerania, it came not with glory, but with fire, blood, and steel. The Saxon invaders, unready for the fury that fell upon them, fled before our advance. In their retreat, they left behind weapons, armour, and gear - precious tools forged for war, now claimed by our mighty Vikings. What they abandoned in fear shall now fuel our wrath. Their iron feeds our forges, their steel arms our warriors. From the ashes of their defeat, we rise stronger, guided by the will of the old gods and the unyielding north wind. "

 JOM_retake_jomsborg: "Retake Jomsborg"
 JOM_retake_jomsborg_desc: "The winds have blown us off course, and we landed where we did not intend, yet perhaps fate was kind. The shore of Bornholm that greeted us was not the one we sought, but it gave us shelter and time to gather our strength.\n\nNow, we must set our course true once more. Jomsborg must be reclaimed.\n\nThat isle is no mere rock in the sea; it is sacred land, soaked in the blood and honor of our ancestors. It is where the runes were first carved into stone, and where Thor's hammer shielded the free folk against tyrants. Jomsborg is the heart of our saga, and it shall beat once more. "

 JOM_northern_flank: "Northern Flank"
 JOM_northern_flank_desc: "We can see Jomsborg right in front of us. Our Viking spirit urges us to strike immediately, without considering the potential dangers. However, it would be unwise to assault an area where we are already expected; there will be many future opportunities to prove ourselves worthy of a place in Valhalla. The best strategy is to approach from the North by capturing the city of Dziwnów, which will confuse our enemies who are prepared for a frontal attack on their positions. Although we will have to travel some distance, with Odin's strength on our side, it will be worth it."

 JOM_direct_strike: "Direct Strike at the City"
 JOM_direct_strike_desc: "To Helheim with that! Who needs strategy when the blood of berserkers boils in our veins? Our warriors will tear through the dissenters like wolves through sheep. Let them cower behind their walls; it will not save them. Jomsborg lies just beyond the river, close enough to taste their fear.\n\nWhat force could ever stop us? It is our birthright, our sacred ground. We shall take it not with caution, but with fury, steel, and the thunderous roar of unchained warriors. Let the earth shake beneath our boots, Jomsborg will fall by dawn."

 JOM_back_in_home: "Back in Our Ancestral Home"
 JOM_back_in_home_desc: "Our sacred city has been retaken from the Wends, and at long last, we can walk its grounds not as strangers, but as heirs. The festival fires are lit once more, and the banners of our forefathers rise high above the old burial mounds. We may now visit the tomb of Harald Bluetooth without shame, speak the names of our ancestors aloud, and feel the spirits stir. Let the drums thunder and the horns sound across the hills, Jomsborg is ours again. Let no enemy set foot here again, for now and always, it stands as a beacon of the North reborn."

 JOM_memories_of_past: "Memories of the Past"
 JOM_memories_of_past_desc: "Our jarl, Halfdan Sandbjerg, walks these fertile lands with pride, but shadows linger around him. Whispers among the people suggest that he was once imprisoned by the Germans, tormented by their ruthless regime. It is said that the iron forged in that suffering shaped the mighty warrior we follow today, a man who was broken, reforged, and set free upon the world. His fury led us to victory, and his vision carved our path through ice and fire. However, some fear that ghosts of his past are stirring again, that old pain gnaws at his heart, and buried truths claw their way to the surface from the dark. Let us pray that the gods fortify his spirit before it shatters."

 JOM_first_althing: "First Althing"
 JOM_first_althing_desc: "At last, our situation in Pomerania stands firm. We have seized enough land to plant the roots of our new realm. In response, Jarl Halfdan has summoned the first Althing, a gathering meant to forge the path toward stability and prosperity.\n\nBut let the scribes talk, and the wise mutter in circles. For the warriors of the north, this is but pretense. What we crave is war. A holy crusade to tear the chains from the Pomeranian lands, chains forged by Christians, liberals, and treacherous Wends. Let them tremble, as our mighty warriors will make their regimes crumble. Till Valhall!"

 JOM_skeggold: "Skeggold! Skálmold!"
 JOM_skeggold_desc: "The winds of change blow with rising fury. The hour draws near - when wolves shall tear asunder those who dared call themselves gods of these lands. From the North comes a tide of reckoning, bearing on its axes the doom of Saxon oppressors and Wendish pretenders alike. Drums. The drums of war echo through the deepest hollows of this land. It is time.\nTime for our heroes to complete the apocalyptic work begun long ago - to end this cruel war, and lead us to the green meadows of Gimlé, where no shadow may follow.\n\nWe are coming.\n\nAxe-age, sword-age - shields are cloven -\nWind-age, wolf-age, before the world collapses;\nNo one will show mercy to another."

 JOM_expand_coastline: "Expand the Coastline"
 JOM_expand_coastline_desc: "On our eastern border lies a mockery of justice, a gilded haven carved out by the treacherous Wends, where only the richest of their kind may feast, while their common folk are left to rot in squalor. A so-called vacation country, built on the sweat and blood of the forgotten.\n\nIt is our sacred duty, blessed by Thor's thunderous wrath, to bring ruin to their pleasure resorts. We shall storm their hotels, tear down their false idols, and seize what was hoarded. The riches of the elite shall be returned to those who truly deserve them - the sons and daughters of Pomerania."

 JOM_ground_assault: "Ground Assault"
 JOM_ground_assault_desc: "The Great Heathen Host has sailed only once; now our axes must strike upon solid ground. We will march in broad formation, shoulder to shoulder, along the entire frontier, ensuring that no corner of these lands remains unclaimed. From the whispering marshes to the rolling hills, our warband advances as one thunderous tide, liberating every hidden glen and hotel in our path. Pinnastrond will fall, and with it, every bourgeoisie. Let the earth tremble beneath our feet, and may the wind carry our battle cry: the North returns, and none shall stand in its way."

 JOM_pinnastrond_raid: "Naval Raid at Pinnastrond"
 JOM_pinnastrond_raid_desc: "Two hundred drakkars will thunder like a storm as they approach this coastal city, their dragon-prows cutting through the waves toward the pale sands of Pinnastrond. At dawn, we will pour ashore in unbroken ranks, shields locked and axes bared, causing the gilded promenades of the Kurortstaat to quake beneath our boots. No enemy line will withstand our fury; no walls will stand against the roar of our horns. In a single, thunderous blow, we will claim every spa, every pier, and every hotel. With that, this war will come to an end. Let the sagas record this day: how the North reclaimed what rightfully belonged to the people!"

 JOM_vacation_over: "Vacation is Over!"
 JOM_vacation_over_desc: "The Pinnastrond and its golden shores are now ours. The days of extravagant vacations are over; no more idle lounging for the elite while the people suffer. Our Viking banners now fly high above the former luxury hotels, which were once the playgrounds of the wealthy.\n\nNow, these lands serve a new purpose. No longer symbols of excess, they will be seized, reclaimed, and repurposed to benefit the general population. The wealth of the coast will be taken from the privileged and shared among the common folk, warriors, workers, and those who cannot afford to live in acceptable conditions."

 JOM_tyr_chosen: "Tyr's Chosen"
 JOM_tyr_chosen_desc: "Our warriors march under the blessing of Tyr himself, the god of war. With such divine favour upon them, they shall stand unbroken against the greatest beasts the land of the Wends can summon. No fang nor steel shall shake their shield-wall. Their hearts beat to the rhythm of old sagas, and their blades carry the weight of righteous fury. Let the enemy send giants, let the earth split and roar - the sons of the North shall not yield. They fight not only for victory, but for glory, for memory, and for the eternal place in Valhalla."

 JOM_fury_of_berserkers: "Fury of the Berserkers"
 JOM_fury_of_berserkers_desc: "When Thor called them to battle, they did not hesitate. For them, honour was victory, and nothing held meaning but the spilled blood of foes and the pride of their shield-brothers, who fought not for gold nor glory, but to live free beneath open skies.\n\nAnd when darkness fell upon the earth, when silence crept among the cold and still forms of the fallen, they knelt. With bloodied hands and weary breath, they gave thanks to the gods, for sacred might, for unyielding spirit, and for the strength to stand while others fell. Their song was not of sorrow; it was for struggle, for survival, for the fire that burned within them still."

 JOM_forging_spears: "Forging the Spears and Axes"
 JOM_forging_spears_desc: "Our strongest berserkers could rip a Wend apart with their bare hands, as wolves tear flesh from a bone. But not all warriors carry such fury in their veins. Many still need steel - not for fear, but for honour, for the joy of battle, and for the weight of a blade in hand.\n\nThe forges of the old world are cold and lifeless, and not many factories remain to feed our Viking might. So we turn to the ways of our ancestors. In the smoke of village smithies, beneath hammers and fire, we shall shape our weapons anew, axeheads from scrap, and blades from iron."

 JOM_shields_from_vendland: "Shieldmaidens of Vendland"
 JOM_shields_from_vendland_desc: "Our shieldmaidens stand equal to the fiercest berserkers. With fire in their hearts and steel in their hands, they fight with the same unyielding courage and grim resolve as any warrior of the North. The gods see no difference in blood spilled for honour, and neither shall we.\n\nNo one should question their place. They have earned the right to stand in the shieldwall, to swing axe and sword, and to carve their path to Valhalla with fury and pride. The shieldbearers, our daughters, sisters, and mothers, shall be the unshaken backbone of our war effort. In battle, they are not women. They are wolves. "

 JOM_shield_wall_perfected: "Shield Wall Perfected"
 JOM_shield_wall_perfected_desc: "The shield wall doctrine, used in every battle, is highly effective. However, a modern adaptation could enhance our war efforts to the point where every man and woman in Pomerania would fear our horns and thirst for battle. By refining our tactics and adapting them for the modern battlefield, we can unleash a war machine that is rooted in tradition yet sharpened by necessity. Mastery on the battlefield will not only lead us to victory but also make Odin and the other gods proud. Dying in battle is the greatest honor, but fighting for our future and our offspring is the sacred duty that binds us to both our past and our destiny."

 JOM_cutting_trees_for_fleet: "Clearing Forests for Ships"
 JOM_cutting_trees_for_fleet_desc: "Along the western shores of Pomerania lie vast, ancient forests - deep and sacred, but their time has come. If we are to raise the great fleet we swore to the gods and our ancestors, the trees must fall. There can be no mercy, only axe and flame.\n\nOne hundred drakkars were promised - longships to carry us across the waters, back to the land of Western Pomerania. To reclaim and fulfil the saga written in our blood and history. The forests shall feed the forges, the shipyards shall thunder with toil, and from the roots of Midgard itself shall rise the legendary fleet that would make the Gods proud. "

 JOM_hit_run_doctrine: "Hit-and-Run Raids Doctrine"
 JOM_hit_run_doctrine_desc: "The strength of our kin has always been in the storm we bring - sudden, fierce, and gone before the dust can settle. We strike like thunder from a clear sky, with no warning, no mercy. One moment, the land is quiet; the next, the clash of steel, the roar of warriors, and fire licking the heavens.\n\nWe raid swiftly and vanish even swifter. While our foes scramble to understand what has happened, we are far away, sails full, laughing with the wind. And when they think they are safe again... we return, in another place, at another time, with the same fury."

 JOM_riverine_warfare: "Riverine Warfare"
 JOM_riverine_warfare_desc: "Langskips of every kind were crafted with such fierce brilliance that they could sail not only the vast, raging seas, but even reach the gods-forsaken shores of far-off Vinland, and glide just as easily through narrow fjords and winding rivers. Their hulls were built for both ocean wrath and inland cunning.\n\nThe Baltic lies behind us now, its waves conquered and forgotten. But ahead... ahead lies a land split by rivers, winding like serpents through the heart of our destiny. And just as before, our longships shall bear us forward, swift and silent, as axes bear down upon the necks of kings."

 JOM_fjm_karl_marx: "FJM Karl Marx"
 JOM_fjm_karl_marx_desc: "Our warband stands strong, an unbroken host of mighty Vikings, ready to seize the winding rivers of Pomerania with our fleet of proud drakkars. However, we are missing something. A longship worthy of sagas yet to be sung, leading our fleet like Fenrir at the head of the storm. We shall forge a vessel the likes of which Midgard has never seen, the mightiest drakkar ever carved from timber and iron. Named after the biggest advocate of basic workers' rights, Karl Marx, the vessel will make even Tyr himself proud. Let the rivers tremble beneath its keel."

 JOM_friggs_care: "Frigg's Care"
 JOM_friggs_care_desc: "Those who can no longer lift an axe or a shield shall never be cast aside. They are the hearth-keepers, the wisdom-bearers - the backbone of our tribe. It is they who raise the next generation of shieldmaidens and berserkers, who keep the fires burning when the warband marches to distant shores.\n\nLet none forget their sacrifice, for it is written in both scar and deed. And may Frigg, wise and gentle, bless them with strength and peace, so that when the horns fall silent and the swords are sheathed, we have a home worthy of our triumphs, and a people still standing to welcome us back."

 JOM_redistribute_loot: "Redistribution of Loot"
 JOM_redistribute_loot_desc: "The spoils of battle are not only for the Jarls. What our warriors seize with axe and fire must be shared with the folk. Let every man, woman, and child taste the fruits of our raids. When gold flows to all, no quarrels arise over how it was won. Thus, we stay strong, bound by blood, honour, and shared purpose. A true Viking victory is not measured by what one man takes, but by the feasting of the whole clan. Our strength is not only in the fury of the berserker, but in the bond of the shield wall and the unity of our people. That is how we shall endure."

 JOM_of_fish_and_mead: "Of Fish and Mead"
 JOM_of_fish_and_mead_desc: "The Viking diet was simple and harsh, shaped by the cold lands and the struggle to grow crops in the stony soil of the North.\n\nNow, we find ourselves in a similar plight. Until better days come, until the next harvest season, we must endure as our ancestors did: living off the fish of the sea, the honey from our hives, and whatever roots, berries, or wild herbs we can gather.\n\nIt may not be a feast fit for the gods, but it shall be enough to keep us strong, proud, and ready for the battles ahead."

 JOM_free_thralls: "Free the Thralls"
 JOM_free_thralls_desc: "The Vikings of old held an ambivalent view of slavery... but we shall not bear such a stain. Though we wear the furs and wield the axes of our ancestors, we care about the oppressed. We are not conquerors alone; we are a liberation army.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must march upon the reeducation camps across the former lands of the Eurokommissariats. We shall break their gates, tear down their fences, and set free every soul within. Political prisoners, forced laborers, and all those chained by the German yoke shall walk free again."

 JOM_power_of_njordr: "Power of Njörðr"
 JOM_power_of_njordr_desc: "Njörðr, warden of wind and wave, shall be the one to whom we offer our toil. As he calms storms and guides ships to safe shores, so too shall he guide our hands as we harness the breath of the sea and the song of the skies.\n\nLet the windmills turn in his name, and the waters flow with his blessing. May his favor bring us warmth in the frostbitten dark and light in the long winter nights. In his might, we shall not burn forests nor dig deep into the bones of the earth, but rise with the power of nature itself, as true sons and daughters of the North."

 JOM_establish_trades_routes: "Establish the Sea Trades Routes"
 JOM_establish_trades_routes_desc: "The sea is a gift from the gods, and it offers us more than just an escape from the madness ashore. Aye, we could raise our sails and vanish into the horizon, leaving the land of the Wends behind in smoke and ruin, but there is greater glory to achieve.\n\nWith wind at our backs and Njordr's blessing, we shall begin to trade, modest at first - small ships, scattered goods. But in time, our voyages shall become the sole lifeline between the world and this shattered coast. Then it will be we who name the price. Riches shall flow to those bold enough to brave the waves, and no one braves them like the sons and daughters of the North."

 JOM_great_serpent: "The Great Serpent Jörmungandr"
 JOM_great_serpent_desc: "The great serpent Jormungandr, wearing the guise of chieftain Tusk, coils himself around our native land, seeking to strangle all sparks of defiance that rise against him and his hordes.\nHis venom has poisoned all life in these lands, and his fangs have pierced through the very sinews of a once-proud people, binding them in an iron grip.\n\nFor all his wicked deeds - for the injustice dealt to our chieftain Sandbjerg and to our kin - he shall pay. And payment shall be in blood, for he is a merchant of slaughter, a peddler of ruin. So shall justice be done, when the villain tastes the edge of his own blade. And we - we shall strike the head from the invading beast, ending this age of terror.\n\nFreedom gained from this malicious wyrm shall be sweeter than the best meads."

 JOM_heartless_liberals: "Heartless Liberals"
 JOM_heartless_liberals_desc: "You - who bore banners of liberation,\nYou - who cloaked their true faces and slithered through the shadows, as cunning as the Trickster himself.\nYou deceived the folk who saw in you salvation, counting on the arm of justice to never reach you, sheltered by the might of the Southerner hordes.\n\nBut now we - we bring judgment. We accuse you of betraying the gods, \nOf betraying all that we hold dear, of betraying your own blood and name.\nLoki himself would call you kin.\nBut the people - they will not forget.\nAnd we… we shall let them pass their sentence.\nFor the law we fight for must bear teeth -\nAnd all who turned their eyes from wickedness shall suffer.\nAnd those who gave the orders...\n\nThere can be only one verdict."

But you must not yield to this cruel turning of fate.\n\nYou are our Germanic brothers.\nAwake!\nAwake - and remember your roots, reaching deep into the foundations of Yggdrasil.\nLook inward, to the soul within, and hear the voice of the Allfather!\nIn this dreadful storm, do you not hear Thor striking his anvil?\nDo you not feel the grace of Frigg when your thoughts turn to kin and hearth?\n\nThere is still hope for your redemption. Join us.\nReclaim the legacy of your true ancestors - and Midgard shall be made whole once more. Together."

 JOM_blood_eagle_traitors_desc: "From the great eyrie of eagles you claim your line. Upon your banners soared the eagle.\nAnd behind its wings you hid your cruelties. Wielding it as shield and spear alike.\nThat single symbol was to bend the people's knee, to force the land itself to bow to your will.\nBut you bled the eagle dry, and cursed it to wear a cloak of shame for all eternity.\n\nSo shall your fate be the eagle's. The blood-eagle.\n\nThere can be no mercy for those who sold their kin into chains, all for the pale illusion of power. No skald shall sing your name. No mother shall speak of you but to warn her child.\nAnd the gods shall never again let you cross the gates of Valhalla."

 JOM_burstaborg_siege_desc: "At the mouth of the Oder stands a stone-born monstrosity, named Szczecin by men.\nWithin the walls of this giant dwells hoarded treasure, piled high by the greedy hands of the outlaws from Hansa. How many swords and axes, how many winters' worth of bread could be bought with such a mountain of gold?\n\nNot even the dwarves of legend matched the lust of the bankers and merchants who bartered souls for silver in this cursed place. To seize this hold is no mere raid - It is the turning of the tide, a blow that grants us the river's heart and carves open the veins of Wendia. But the gold…the gold cries louder than the river itself. For our folk await not just conquest, but justice. And justice weighs its scales in coin and flame alike."

 JOM_summer_gone: "Summer is Ending"
 JOM_summer_gone_desc: "Not all that glitters is gold, and not all born in Szczecin are sold. In the bowels of that stony giant, dwell some who still follow the red northern star - that old sign of freedom, equality, and brotherhood, carried southward by the Summer Union.\n\nAmong their ranks walk many who might yet stand beside us, shoulder to shoulder. They served a false tyrant, but not by choice. Now we offer them that freedom: To cast down hollow idols and embrace the truth that Allfather Odin whispers to all who dare listen with open hearts.\n\nIt will take many moons, and the Oder will run long before they earn the right to be called sons and daughters of the North. But should their will prove pure, clear as glacial spring - then our hearths shall open, and our kin shall call them family."

 JOM_sack_the_city_desc: "There is no scent sweeter than that of a burning city at dawn. This… this is what justice smells like. Too much gold has been hoarded in the coffers of the mighty lords of Szczecin for our warriors to pass by in silence. Behind their walls lie many homes - and in them, the innocent. The gods have forbidden us from touching them. Vengeance must be reserved for those who poisoned this land with their decaying creed, for those who fattened their bellies on the backs of the weary.\n\nWhen the day is done, a crimson glow will rise over Burstaborg, and the guilty shall drown in their own blood. Yet the morning that follows - that sacred dawn - shall bring rebirth.\nAnd with it, a purging fire to cleanse us all from the mistakes of the past."

Thor, in his thunderous glory, and Njordr, lord of winds and tides, guided us to this shore, that we may fulfill our fate.\nYet in the heart of the city - in Burstaborg - lies a gift far greater than even the most faithful skald could dream:\n\nForges. Colossal forges that spew forth iron beasts. Forges that could build ships to sail not just the sea - but the Nine Realms themselves! We must awaken their fire again, stoke the flame beneath their ancient hearths. For only Odin knows what monstrous marvels our master-smiths shall forge. And the metal they shape - by sweat, by blood, by prayer - shall endure even the wrath of Surtr himself."

Its harbors and shipyards are the key to forging a fleet worthy of our ambitions, a fleet that will secure our dominance across the Baltic.\n\nBut there is more at stake than ships and salt winds. The cursed sons of Germania may yet seek to crawl back to these shores like wretched draugar. That cannot be allowed. By Odin's will, this land shall never again bow to foreign rule.\n\nNot all is lost to treachery; the red banners still fly over the city.

With a single, thundering battle cry, our warriors shall storm their halls like wolves in the night, and with one mighty swing of our axes, we will bring their dominion to ruin.

 JOM_wolfs_holmgang_desc: "Aleksander Jabłonowski, known as Jaszczur, is often labeled as a traitor, spy, and enemy of the people. He has betrayed his country and acted against his own people, making it difficult to find any redeeming qualities in him. However, one aspect we cannot overlook is his bravery. The holmgang, a traditional duel, between Jarl Halfdan and Jabłonowski will occur soon. It is said that Jaszczur faces this challenge without fear, preparing for the fight with a smile. His courage is reminiscent of the bravest warriors of Odin. May the Gods protect our Jarl and grant him the strength of Thor to defeat this madman. "

In the dense woods, they lurk like wolves too cowardly to show their fangs. Their ambushes strike swiftly and cruelly, felling even our fiercest berserkers before they can lift their axes. It is war without glory and without honor.\n\nThis reeks of Loki's mischief, serving as a test of spirit and resolve. Our men dread those cursed forests, for there is no shield wall, no war cry, only silence, traps, and death lurking behind. But we are sons of the North, and though they slither in the darkness, we shall meet them with fire and wrath until their cunning is no more."

Let no one despair, for in the eyes of the gods, hardship is merely a forge in which true warriors are shaped. Those who emerge from the shadowed forests, bloodied but unbroken, shall earn glory beyond measure. The weak will fall, while the worthy shall rise. What emerges from these cursed woods will not be an ordinary raider, but a hardened champion of Odin, a chosen of Tyr, blessed by Freyja's gaze. Let the trials begin; from them will rise the fiercest warriors of our age and seal the doom of the Lizardman."

Let us cast them beyond the ocean, back to their land of greed and deceit. Let Thor's hammer fall upon them, and let our axes sing with vengeance. Their false gods will not save them when the storm of the North crashes down."

There shall be no escape, no salvation. Not a single boat carrying reinforcements or supplies will slip through our grip.\n\nWe will cast a net of steel and fire across the waters, and once caught, the Skrælingar shall not be freed.

We will send forth our warriors with steel. Enlightenment will not come from empty debates, but from the sound of bone fracturing and axes striking the earth.

It is here, on these fertile plains and gentle hills, that we must begin to rebuild. We will discard the false comfort of agrotourism like a broken shield and restore the land to its true purpose: to feed our people. We will move the herds, build longhouses of stone and timber, and till the soil with the strength of many warriors.

As they are our northern kin, there should be no obstacle in reaching an understanding. In truth, their commander, Chieftain Hellebjerg, holds little love for the chains of UN central command. He yearns for freedom, a warrior's freedom, to act without hesitation, without foreign whispers dulling his axe.\n\nLet the blue helmets gleam with the fury of the old gods.

And we must seize this moment.\n\n We shall extract all that is useful from this so-called humanitarian mission. Let the United Nations grumble and gnash their teeth; their distant fury matters little compared to the steel and supplies we can gain on the ground.

They will not take arms in our battles, but they shall guard the lifelines of our new realm, the supply routes, key strongholds, and vital ports. The gods demand order through strength, and through this pact, the fury of the North shall march unbroken. "

Grand ceremonies will blaze like the fires of Muspelheim, with festivals roaring to the beat of war drums, and joyous feasts celebrating the endless victories carved into our fate.

Lofn, gentle goddess of forbidden bonds, offers shelter to even the most scorned, to those cast aside by fear and ignorance. And if the gods, in all their wisdom, do not judge the heart of a soul - then neither shall we. What matters is not how one walks, but whether their hands build rather than destroy, whether they stand by their kin when the storms howl loudest.\n\nSome warriors - hard of heart and quick to wrath - may scoff at such mercy. But only because they have not listened to the deeper verses of the sagas. It is the duty of a wise chieftain to open their eyes - not with blade, but with truth. We cannot demand that all love alike, nor force the heart to change. But if we turn from division, and instead stand side by side in our reverence for the gods, then there shall be no need for laws, no cause for quarrel.\n\nOnly kinship."

Equality forged in fire, not parchment. It is the way of the world - as it was, as it should be.\n\nElse, we stoke the fire of false war between the sexes, kindled by those who profit from division. Some speak to young women of flawless beauty, of waiting for princes, of golden chains dressed as gifts. They lie. A woman need not wait.

They belong to those chosen - to our priests who walk the misted paths of spirit, and to our warriors who must see beyond the veil in the heat of battle.\n\nFor such substances do not only harden the sinew and awaken the blood - they open the eye of the soul.

Any soul bold enough to dream of limiting Halfdan's mandate will now face not only the voice of the commons…but the Commonwealth of Jarls, rooted in oaths, bloodlines, and flame-tempered loyalty.

He was born on Danish soil.\n\nThe pattern is clear - example upon example, root upon root - the fate of the Wends is knotted deep within the saga of the northern tribes. We must reclaim that truth, not bury it. We belong to the great tree of history, and the hour has come to bind its branches once more under the banner of the raven and the watchful eye of the Allfather.

An era of glory, of gold, mead and of splendorous feasts came crumbling down, all because of one cunning strategist. A snake in the body of a man. With humiliation wrought upon the north came the encroachment of a foreign God, strangling the souls and minds of once great warriors, shackling them and rendering them slaves.\n\nYet those days, those most glorious of days, may return once more! Hymns of spilled blood, of scarred bodies and of unparalleled treasures will be sung until the days of Ragnarök, and for one day more, ever after, so long as we live, even if our Gods fall. We will be the new wave of glorious plunder, as our predecessors once reigned! "

The corpus, deep beneath the ribs and away from our beloved naval home makes them complacent, makes them believe that they are safe. They grow soft within their inland holds, they don't bother with defending what they hold dear. We'll strike deep, between the ribs, between the folds of their brain to let loose fear. True fear."

After his public denunciations of EKs' inner patologies and shady deals ultimately resulted in his arrest and a police raid on his house, Zandberg made  a speech on how not even the EU is able to save the failed concept that is Poland, and that in order to build a respectable state, Polish identity as a whole needs  to be replaced with a more noble, Nordic one."

 jomsborg.5.desc: "Far away from all the chaos of the European mainland, surrounded by the cold and tempestuous waters of the Baltic, a Danish island of Bornholm had its place. It's a calm and peaceful islet where life goes on slowly, away from busy center of Denmark. In their bliss, or maybe ignorance and blind trust, the islanders of Bornholm gave refuge to a group of refugees from Poland. Plenty of time has passed since the European intervention took place and numerous boats disembarked upon beaches near Svaneke. Locals, at first somewhat concerned, have eased their tense outlook after the leader of the Poles - Adrian Zandberg greeted them in their native Danish tounge, despite the welcoming speech being simple and very rusty. \n \n To not cause any trouble, the refuges formed a small commune just outside the town, building wooden huts out of any scraps they could scrounge up. As months passed the settlement grew in size, soon named Folkvangr, after the mythical refuge for fallen warriors ruled by goddess Freyja. Entirety of the village centered itself around the longhouse built out of discarded shipping containers - Sessrúmnir, where the Carmine Jarl held his meetings, and after dark planned his grand return. With a growing population soon came a need for a blacksmith, fishermen, shipwrights and traders who knew at least three words in Danish. Albeit small and desolate, the village of Folkvangr held an indominable spirit of determination, as each evening, when the sun set, the villagers gathered around the campfire to sing tales of the old lands, the ones stolen from them, and the ones they will take back. \n \n With time, the viking spirit started to spread throughout the community, as they all gravitated to the wise, yet sometimes unstable leader. As his mental strain increased, no doubt caused by years of unsuccessful attempts of peacefully taking over and improving the state of Poland, soon cracks started to show. The new identity of Halfdan Sandbjerg took root in the cracks of his mind, a stern viking high chief who would not bend a knee to anyone was needed to unite his broken, but faithful warriors and bring them back into glorious warfare against western invaders. \n \n With his personality shifted, a Great Temple of Odin was raised beside the longhouse, where Gothis appointed by him would lead ceremonies in the name of the Allfather. The adamant high chief Sandbjerg now looks upon his fledging settlement of lost but faithful souls, as he stands upon a hill, watching yet another drakkar take shape in the \"shipyard\". Soon the Viking warriors of Folkvangr shall sail south, and write a saga worthy of Valhalla!"

 jomsborg.8.desc: "Quiet skies above Bornholm, normally cloudy and peaceful, were broken by loud juddering of a helicopter. Rotor blades slashed through the morning fog as the Danish Royal Coast Guard aircraft made its way towards the anomalous settlement on the Eastern coast of the Island. Aboard it, sat Mikkel Rasmunsen, deputy officer of Capital Region Administration, a person not important enough to hold a position in the Copenhagen council, yet important enough to be sent out to investigate reports about a weird village somewhere in the Baltic backwaters of the Kingdom. He sat in the back of a Coast Guard helicopter with a folder full of wild descriptions of a \"wild Norsemen LARP Group\" setting up a permanent settlement outside Sveneke in one hand, and his temples in another. He cursed to himself that this is not what he spent years on best Copenhagen universities for. Soon however his angry meditation was interrupted by the pilot. \n \n - Deputy, sir, we're almost there. \n \n Looking outside the window, his eyes widened and eyebrows lifted high. Reports weren't exaggarated, it truly was a ragtag group of Viking LARPers living in a real norse temple tribe, however crude. The arrival of a \"shrieking silver bird\" caused quite a commotion in the village, as both men, women and children crowded outside their wood-mud huts pointing, waving and cowering before the \"monster\". \n \n - Put us down, I need to see this up close. - Mikkel spoke, in a feat of bewildered curiosity. \n - Yes, sir. - Pilot responded, proceeding to set down the helicopter upon an empty field nearby the village. \n \n As the rotors kicked up clouds of dust around the landing site, nearly all wildly infatuated villagers surrounded the aircraft, some bearing crude, rusty axes in their shaking hands. Mikkel opened the sliding side door as soon as the helicopter's wheels touched the ground, holding onto his folder tightly. Women and children shouted in fear, as the man in black exited the \"bird's belly\". The Danish deputy truly looked out of place in his suit, surrounded by unshaven Viking cosplayers covered in blankets and ripped up carpets. The remaining bravest of the men formed a shaking shield wall formation, and braced for a fight. Thankfully before anything bad happened, a tall and burly man emerged from the formation, other warriors cowered before him in respect. \n \n - Vælkomin outsider! - his boomy voice echoed around as he spread his arms in welcome, speaking very crude Danish. - Allfather be praised, messenger of Huginn and Muninn, I welcome you to Folkvangr! \n \n The atmosphere surrounding the landing site eased quickly, as shields and axes were lowered. Mikkel stood quite shocked, but quickly snapped back, fixed his suit and approached the Jarl who bore a long Carmine cape. Chief of the tribe was nearly elated, that his actions brought the attention of Odin's Ravens, as he led the deputy towards the longhouse in the center of the village. Mikkel reckoned, it would be in his best interest to simply play along and report what he saw afterwards."

 jomsborg.9.desc: "Fire of the forge beamed an aura of comforting heat, among the chill winds of western Baltic. Villagers gathered around the broken container which housed the melting kiln, watching as the work in the smithy continued every day, preparing weapons and armour for the upcoming invasion. Any item even vaguely metallic in nature that wasn't bolted to the ground by the Danish natives of the island, was subsequently acquired and repurposed by the Folkvangr host. Scrap melted in the steel kiln was the backbone of the settlements rearmament effort. \n \n Sitting on a stump nearby, an experienced warrior Bjorn was taking a moment to sharpen his trusty axe. The forge running day and night, required large amounts of wood and him, among other warriors on rotation helped in cutting wood logs for the fire. Each slide of the whetstone sent sparks onto the chilled ground. He longed for a return to the lands he, along with the rest of the tribe were exiled from, so each day he volunteered for extra work, to ensure the success of upcoming strife. Focused on his axe, and somewhat sleep deprived for weeks on end, he failed to notice the towering figure approaching him. \n \n - Ver heill ok sæll, Brother Bjorn. - A deep voice greeted him, bringing him up to attention. \n - Hail Jarl Halfdan! - He got up and holstered his axe, after which he placed his hand on his chest and bowed his head, noticing none other than the Chief of the tribe. \n - No need for bowing, brother. - Jarl quite roughly pat Bjorn's shoulder and gave him a reassuring smile from underneath his burly beard. - I had hoped you'd have some time to speak, in the Longhouse. \n - For you, anything, my Jarl. - He nodded, and followed his leader. \n \n With each step, the chainmail of the Jarl, made out of melted pots and pans clanged, magnifying his already dominating presence. His carmine cape flapped in the chilly seashore breeze. \n - The gods have noticed your sacrifice for the cause, and so have I. - Jarl spoke calmly, as the two arrived at the Longhouse. - You've been at my side longer than most. \n - Yes, Chief, even before the heathenous bastards exiled us. - His fists tightened, at the sheer thought. \n - Soon, my brother, soon. - he said reassuringly as the two entered through the doors. \n \n Inside, a group of elite warriors awaited them, bearing carmine shields and gjermundbu helmets. The troope bowed their heads before the Jarl, as he turned to Bjorn. \n - I wish for you, to join the ranks of my huskarls, and fight our foes in the name of Odin. \n - I'd be honoured to, my Jarl. - Bjorn bowed as Halfdan Sandbjerg himself, bestowed a housecarl helmet upon his head. \n The warriors cheered three times, \"skál! skál! skál!\", welcoming a new face among their ranks."

A village on the coast of the Baltic Sea like any other, made its living from tourism, however after the Eurocorps intervention, whole industry went silent seemingly overnight. Nowadays it's populated by a fraction of its original inhabitants, people either too proud, or too poor to leave and try to find a way to live in the new reality. \n \n Jan, a young adult native to the village, layed upon his bed and stared at the ceiling. He remained behind in a decrepid wooden hut to take care of his sickly grandma, after his brother disappeared, and his friends scattered among towns and cities of the region. In his insomnia induced rambling, he cursed the political establishment that led to how the country ended up. He rolled onto his side, and looked at the wall, onto which he taped an old, faded poster, carmine shade of which brought him peace, and reminded him of the time he and his brother used to be volunteers for Razem Party, years ago. Maybe this nostalgia was what made him believe in the rumours coursing throughout the village and beyond. That the exiled leader is very much still around, and has not forsaken his mission. With a sigh, he got up and rubbed his sleep deprived eyes. Stealthily, he snuck out of the hut, and walked towards the beach, hoping that the sea would bring him some respite. He sat down on the cold sand, and closed his eyes, listening to waves break against the shore. In this moment, he only wished for a sign, that things will change soon. \n \n Suddenly, he heard a sound of old wood hitting the sand. He opened his eyes, and saw a truly unusual sight, a boat, with a crudely carved dragon head on the bow. Two burly, bearded men clad in rough carpets coloured with carmine paint, jumped out and pulled the boat ashore. Jan was taken aback, but, the familiarly painted capes worn by the sailors ignited something in him. He ran up to them, tripping on the sand dunes. \n \n - Brother Ivarr, I'm glad to see you once more. - One of the men kneeled beside him, and reached his hand forward. \n - Zygmunt? Is that you, brother? - Jan took his hand, he remembered that face . \n - Agmundr now, brother. - The two siblings embraced tightly. - Odin be praised you're alright. \n - Where have you been? What's going on with this get-up? - Jan spoke in shocked surprise. \n - No time for explanation, brother, trust in Mimir's wisdom, and prepare for our return. Spread the word, Agent of Loki, for your past efforts haven't been forgotten. \n \n Ivarr stood up, with renewed determination. With a stern look on his face he nodded to his brother. Now him, alongside countless past volunteers were activated as sleeper agents, sowing a seed of revolution, before the return of the Carmine Jarl."

 jomsborg.26.t: "The End of the White Wolf"
 jomsborg.26.desc: "At the crossing of three roads, dozens of huskarls and shieldmaidens had gathered. Standing in a wide circle, they shouted and cursed, their voices rising louder than the crashing of the nearby sea. At the center of their scorn stood a gaunt figure clad in a tattered uniform - Aleksander Jabłonowski. Wojciech Olszański as was his true name. Lizard as he was called by his enemies and some \"friends\". Though wearied by years of war and wandering, he stood tall, clinging to what pride he still possessed. In one hand he held a nicked sword, in the other, a weathered leather shield. He said nothing, lost in the memory of battles - those fought before the cameras, and those waged in forests and scorched villages. Then a great roar thundered through the air, silencing the crowd. The silence was broken only by the slow, heavy beat of footsteps. Into the ring stepped Halfdan, taller than any man, clad in the hide of a bear, an axe in each hand. Beside him walked his retainer, who stopped between the two warriors, unrolled a scroll, and read aloud:\n\n- Wojciech Olszański, you have been challenged to holmgang by Halfdan Sandbjerg, for evil deeds done against the people of Wendland and the republic they held dear. You shall fight with chosen weapons. Broken shields may not be replaced. The duel ends in death, and the victor shall claim the spoils of the fallen.\n\nWith that, the warriors stepped closer, face to face, waiting for the Norse herald to leave the circle. The Dane struck first, swinging from above, but Wojciech caught the blow on his shield and countered with a slash from the right. Halfdan leapt aside and struck again, another downward blow, again blocked. The crowd howled anew, hurling curses at the one called out.\nWojciech thrust his blade forward, but Halfdan stepped back, caught the sword between the haft and blade of his axe, and wrenched it free, hurling it to the edge of the ring. So fierce was the move that Halfdan stumbled, unbalanced, leaving his guard open. Olszański seized the moment - he swung, and with all his fury, smashed the shield into the Dane's head. Halfdan staggered backward, dazed.\n\nSeeing his foe charge, Lizard surged forward - but the Dane, now enraged, charged as well, raining blows upon the already-weak shield. Wojciech heard the wood split - a terrible crack - and then he was on the ground, beneath the towering Viking. Halfdan cast aside his axes. He leapt onto his foe, striking his head again.\nAnd again. And again. And again.\nThen - silence.\n\nAnd Wojciech found himself upon a green meadow, beneath a sky untouched by smoke.\nAround him stood his comrades.\nAnd his wife.\nHis kin."

 unification.76.t: "[GetNewspaper]Folkerepublikken Jomsborg conquers West Pomerania!"
 unification.76.desc: "Years ago, back when Eurokommissariats were first created, leftist agitators and politicians were deemed a thorn in Tusk's side. Among their  leaders was Adrian Zandberg, who soon went missing under suspicious circumstances. Nobody knew what happened to him afterward, yet eventually, he returned to  unleash hell upon us all. His great army of socialists and Vikings invaded the western shore, smashing all liberal and fascist resistance, creating a state  combining Scandinavian social democracy and Nordic paganism. Many cities belonging to the neighboring cliques were soon set ablaze, bearing witness to a new way to  redistribute wealth - bloody coastal raids. While definitely a brutal method, due to this stolen cash, the Folkerepublikken's citizens maintain that this ecological  welfare state truly enhanced their living standard compared to the times of Westpolen. Now both capitalists and Christians are hunted down, their bodies turned into  blood eagles, serving as grim examples of the madness engulfing Poland."

 POLITICS_HALFDAN_SANDBJERG_DESC: "There was a man who dreamt of a better Poland. Of social justice and equality. Of a peaceful struggle for rights and against  exploitation. This man navigated carefully in the sea of politics, trying to balance the needs of people and requirements of liberal democracy. All these efforts  proved to be in vain. \n\nThe EU intervention, seeming auspicious at first, brought nothing but further misery to Poland. The gates to a just, equitable European  society were just as before, closed shut. Adrian Zandberg began to criticize the occupational government, and the angry masses heeded his words too eagerly. Tusk  ordered his imprisonment and handed him over to some of the most despicable thugs he could foster. Zandberg never disclosed the details, but he escaped the prison  as a different man. \n\nHe got to the shores of Bornholm and gazed upon the sea. He ran from beyond the sea, yes, but his origins were here, in the North. His blood  boiled, his soul yearned for revenge. What good was there in the constant squabbling and striving to bring forward a civil, non-violent popular change? He was the  survivor, the warrior, the Northman - a Viking. If Poland has failed to become a fair, humane country, that's too bad for Poland. \n\nSandbjerg wants to start with  an axe and end with a helping hand. The redistribution of wealth can be done by force alone, and Sandbjerg draws it from many sources - starting from deranged  neopagans, through disillusioned revolutionaries, ending on radicalized social democrats; whoever willing to fight will get their share. There is no simple answer  to whether this is an unorthodox interpretation of socialism or simple warlordism, although time will bring an answer to that query. \n\nFor now, §0the storm is  coming from the north, and the Poles are going to wither.§!"
