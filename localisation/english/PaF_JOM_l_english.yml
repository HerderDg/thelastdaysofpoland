 JOM_ny_saga_desc: "Enter the story of gods and heroes, where the improbable meets the impossible, where the tale begins with an exiled man with ambitions reaching the stars. This man is destined to travel beyond the sea to meet his faith. He's going to achieve greatness, like every hero does. Of course, one can be great and venerated, as well as one can be great and feared. Alas, everyone has their dark side. And this journey shall not be an easy feat, as the inner demons and outside threats will block any rays of hope. It's a story about finding their own identity. About ordinary humans battling the giants. About a man with a fire in his eyes, who wants to revolutionize his country in ways unimaginable. This change shall come with the tides. Tides that will sweep the rotten liberalism out of the face of Midgard. This is the saga of Adrian Zandberg."

 JOM_folkvangr_enclave_desc: "Far from the fjords and frozen hearths of the North, they came - those who would not kneel to foreign kings, nor abandon the gods of their fathers. Cast into exile, they carved a refuge from stone and wind, and named it Fólkvangr, after the sacred field where half of the honoured dead rest beneath Freyja's gaze.\n\nIn this strange land, the spirit of the North endures. The scent of pine smoke drifts through the air, mingling with the ring of hammers on steel. Mead is poured in hand-carved halls, sagas are recited as gospel, and children learn to carry both shield and verse.\n\nFor the day will come when the horn sounds, and Ragnarök begins."
 
 JOM_who_am_i: "Who Am I?"
 JOM_who_am_i_desc: "Halfdan Sandbjerg. Harald. Adrian Zandberg.\nThe names swirled like mist in his mind. Was he a Viking or a politician? A raider or a man of the people? A distant land called to him across the sea. Should he sail for it, sword in hand? Plunder its riches? Set its shores ablaze in glory and wrath? No... no, it was different. That land - he knew it. He remembered its rivers, its sorrows, its people. But not who he had been among them. He must help them. He must take from them. He must become... something new. But still the question burned behind his eyes, as cold as the northern wind:\n\n§RWho is he?"
 
 JOM_what_am_i_doing: "What Am I Doing?"
 JOM_what_am_i_doing_desc: "Sandbjerg's main concern was not the cold, nor the hunger, nor even the war drums echoing in the Bornholm island. It was the question that gnawed at his soul - what was he actually doing? He was a jarl, yes. He led bloodthirsty warriors across the shattered coastlines of the Baltic, promising gold, glory, and a place in the halls of Valhalla. They drank to his name. They sang of his victories. His banners flew high over ruined towns. But as the fires burned and the ships returned heavy with spoils, doubt clung to him like salt on the wind.\nWas he truly born to raid?\nOr was there still a man, Adrian Zandberg, somewhere beneath the helm and beard?\n\nHe could not answer.\n\n§RHe could only sail forward."

But to achieve this goal, we need people: brave, strong warriors who, under Jarl Sandbjerg's command, will reclaim what is rightfully ours. The time has come to send out the call to all refugees; the Gjallarhorn sounds, summoning them to battle. May Thor forge their hearts into those warriors who are ready to answer Odin's call. Sandbjerg will lead us back to the soil that bore us, the land so vilely stolen from us."

They did not buy the tale that we are just poor refugees from a shattered homeland. Perhaps setting up a camp filled with Viking shields, banners, and weapons was not the most tactically sound way to conceal our true intentions. And now, they dare to send in inspectors, hoping to catch us red-handed. Let them try, but they will not dig us out that easily; Odin will protect us from their malicious approach to our cause. "

Unlike the Max Kolonko Americanists, we do not have the luxury of a powerful American ally providing resources freely. We must arm and feed ourselves. While we can produce some supplies ourselves, we may need to consider resorting to the black market if necessary.

Strife boils like storm-tossed seas, when the unjust lords tear at each other with iron and spite.\n\nNow is the hour foretold.\nNow we take up our axes, as our forebears did,\nAnd with steel and wrath,\nWe bring ruin to the false kings and burn their thrones to ash."

War has passed like a winter storm, but within these stone halls, wealth still clings to the shadows - chalices, reliquaries, tapestries, untouched by hunger, untouched by loss.\n\nMany wonder how such treasures stayed untouched when so much else was broken. How the altars stayed polished, while villages were burned, and children grew up with empty stomachs.\n\nAmong those who now wander through the vast coastal lands, there are whispers about the church's riches. What good is the gold serving while sealed away in tombs of faith, when the living have nothing?"

 JOM_germanic_equipment: "Germanic Equipment"
 JOM_germanic_equipment_desc: "When Ragnarök swept through the land of Pomerania, it came not with glory, but with fire, blood, and steel. The Saxon invaders, unready for the fury that fell upon them, fled before our advance. In their retreat, they left behind weapons, armour, and gear - precious tools forged for war, now claimed by our mighty Vikings. What they abandoned in fear shall now fuel our wrath. Their iron feeds our forges, their steel arms our warriors. From the ashes of their defeat, we rise stronger, guided by the will of the old gods and the unyielding north wind. "

 JOM_retake_jomsborg: "Retake Jomsborg"
 JOM_retake_jomsborg_desc: "The winds have blown us off course, and we landed where we did not intend, yet perhaps fate was kind. The shore of Bornholm that greeted us was not the one we sought, but it gave us shelter and time to gather our strength.\n\nNow, we must set our course true once more. Jomsborg must be reclaimed.\n\nThat isle is no mere rock in the sea; it is sacred land, soaked in the blood and honor of our ancestors. It is where the runes were first carved into stone, and where Thor's hammer shielded the free folk against tyrants. Jomsborg is the heart of our saga, and it shall beat once more. "

 JOM_northern_flank: "Northern Flank"
 JOM_northern_flank_desc: "We can see Jomsborg right in front of us. Our Viking spirit urges us to strike immediately, without considering the potential dangers. However, it would be unwise to assault an area where we are already expected; there will be many future opportunities to prove ourselves worthy of a place in Valhalla. The best strategy is to approach from the North by capturing the city of Dziwnów, which will confuse our enemies who are prepared for a frontal attack on their positions. Although we will have to travel some distance, with Odin's strength on our side, it will be worth it."

 JOM_direct_strike: "Direct Strike at the City"
 JOM_direct_strike_desc: "To Helheim with that! Who needs strategy when the blood of berserkers boils in our veins? Our warriors will tear through the dissenters like wolves through sheep. Let them cower behind their walls; it will not save them. Jomsborg lies just beyond the river, close enough to taste their fear.\n\nWhat force could ever stop us? It is our birthright, our sacred ground. We shall take it not with caution, but with fury, steel, and the thunderous roar of unchained warriors. Let the earth shake beneath our boots, Jomsborg will fall by dawn."

 JOM_back_in_home: "Back in Our Ancestral Home"
 JOM_back_in_home_desc: "Our sacred city has been retaken from the Wends, and at long last, we can walk its grounds not as strangers, but as heirs. The festival fires are lit once more, and the banners of our forefathers rise high above the old burial mounds. We may now visit the tomb of Harald Bluetooth without shame, speak the names of our ancestors aloud, and feel the spirits stir. Let the drums thunder and the horns sound across the hills, Jomsborg is ours again. Let no enemy set foot here again, for now and always, it stands as a beacon of the North reborn."

 JOM_memories_of_past: "Memories of the Past"
 JOM_memories_of_past_desc: "Our jarl, Halfdan Sandbjerg, walks these fertile lands with pride, but shadows linger around him. Whispers among the people suggest that he was once imprisoned by the Germans, tormented by their ruthless regime. It is said that the iron forged in that suffering shaped the mighty warrior we follow today, a man who was broken, reforged, and set free upon the world. His fury led us to victory, and his vision carved our path through ice and fire. However, some fear that ghosts of his past are stirring again, that old pain gnaws at his heart, and buried truths claw their way to the surface from the dark. Let us pray that the gods fortify his spirit before it shatters."

 JOM_first_althing: "First Althing"
 JOM_first_althing_desc: "At last, our situation in Pomerania stands firm. We have seized enough land to plant the roots of our new realm. In response, Jarl Halfdan has summoned the first Althing, a gathering meant to forge the path toward stability and prosperity.\n\nBut let the scribes talk, and the wise mutter in circles. For the warriors of the north, this is but pretense. What we crave is war. A holy crusade to tear the chains from the Pomeranian lands, chains forged by Christians, liberals, and treacherous Wends. Let them tremble, as our mighty warriors will make their regimes crumble. Till Valhall!"

 JOM_skeggold: "Skeggold! Skálmold!"

From the North comes a tide of reckoning, bearing on its axes the doom of Saxon oppressors and Wendish pretenders alike. Drums. The drums of war echo through the deepest hollows of this land. It is time.\nTime for our heroes to complete the apocalyptic work begun long ago - to end this cruel war, and lead us to the green meadows of Gimlé, where no shadow may follow.\n\nWe are coming.\n\nAxe-age, sword-age - shields are cloven -\nWind-age, wolf-age, before the world collapses;\nNo one will show mercy to another."

 JOM_expand_coastline: "Expand the Coastline"
 JOM_expand_coastline_desc: "On our eastern border lies a mockery of justice, a gilded haven carved out by the treacherous Wends, where only the richest of their kind may feast, while their common folk are left to rot in squalor. A so-called vacation country, built on the sweat and blood of the forgotten.\n\nIt is our sacred duty, blessed by Thor's thunderous wrath, to bring ruin to their pleasure resorts. We shall storm their hotels, tear down their false idols, and seize what was hoarded. The riches of the elite shall be returned to those who truly deserve them - the sons and daughters of Pomerania."

 JOM_ground_assault: "Ground Assault"

We will march in broad formation, shoulder to shoulder, along the entire frontier, ensuring that no corner of these lands remains unclaimed. From the whispering marshes to the rolling hills, our warband advances as one thunderous tide, liberating every hidden glen and hotel in our path. Pinnastrond will fall, and with it, every bourgeoisie. Let the earth tremble beneath our feet, and may the wind carry our battle cry: the North returns, and none shall stand in its way."

 JOM_pinnastrond_raid: "Naval Raid at Pinnastrond"
 JOM_pinnastrond_raid_desc: "Two hundred drakkars will thunder like a storm as they approach this coastal city, their dragon-prows cutting through the waves toward the pale sands of Pinnastrond. At dawn, we will pour ashore in unbroken ranks, shields locked and axes bared, causing the gilded promenades of the Kurortstaat to quake beneath our boots. No enemy line will withstand our fury; no walls will stand against the roar of our horns. In a single, thunderous blow, we will claim every spa, every pier, and every hotel. With that, this war will come to an end. Let the sagas record this day: how the North reclaimed what rightfully belonged to the people!"

 JOM_vacation_over: "Vacation is Over!"
 JOM_vacation_over_desc: "The Pinnastrond and its golden shores are now ours. The days of extravagant vacations are over; no more idle lounging for the elite while the people suffer. Our Viking banners now fly high above the former luxury hotels, which were once the playgrounds of the wealthy.\n\nNow, these lands serve a new purpose. No longer symbols of excess, they will be seized, reclaimed, and repurposed to benefit the general population. The wealth of the coast will be taken from the privileged and shared among the common folk, warriors, workers, and those who cannot afford to live in acceptable conditions."

 JOM_tyr_chosen: "Tyr's Chosen"
 JOM_tyr_chosen_desc: "Our warriors march under the blessing of Tyr himself, the god of war. With such divine favour upon them, they shall stand unbroken against the greatest beasts the land of the Wends can summon. No fang nor steel shall shake their shield-wall. Their hearts beat to the rhythm of old sagas, and their blades carry the weight of righteous fury. Let the enemy send giants, let the earth split and roar - the sons of the North shall not yield. They fight not only for victory, but for glory, for memory, and for the eternal place in Valhalla."

 JOM_fury_of_berserkers: "Fury of the Berserkers"
 JOM_fury_of_berserkers_desc: "When Thor called them to battle, they did not hesitate. For them, honour was victory, and nothing held meaning but the spilled blood of foes and the pride of their shield-brothers, who fought not for gold nor glory, but to live free beneath open skies.\n\nAnd when darkness fell upon the earth, when silence crept among the cold and still forms of the fallen, they knelt. With bloodied hands and weary breath, they gave thanks to the gods, for sacred might, for unyielding spirit, and for the strength to stand while others fell. Their song was not of sorrow; it was for struggle, for survival, for the fire that burned within them still."

 JOM_forging_spears: "Forging the Spears and Axes"
 JOM_forging_spears_desc: "Our strongest berserkers could rip a Wend apart with their bare hands, as wolves tear flesh from a bone. But not all warriors carry such fury in their veins. Many still need steel - not for fear, but for honour, for the joy of battle, and for the weight of a blade in hand.\n\nThe forges of the old world are cold and lifeless, and not many factories remain to feed our Viking might. So we turn to the ways of our ancestors. In the smoke of village smithies, beneath hammers and fire, we shall shape our weapons anew, axeheads from scrap, and blades from iron."

 JOM_shields_from_vendland: "Shieldmaidens of Vendland"
 JOM_shields_from_vendland_desc: "Our shieldmaidens stand equal to the fiercest berserkers. With fire in their hearts and steel in their hands, they fight with the same unyielding courage and grim resolve as any warrior of the North. The gods see no difference in blood spilled for honour, and neither shall we.\n\nNo one should question their place. They have earned the right to stand in the shieldwall, to swing axe and sword, and to carve their path to Valhalla with fury and pride. The shieldbearers, our daughters, sisters, and mothers, shall be the unshaken backbone of our war effort. In battle, they are not women. They are wolves. "

 JOM_shield_wall_perfected: "Shield Wall Perfected"
 JOM_shield_wall_perfected_desc: "The shield wall doctrine, used in every battle, is highly effective. However, a modern adaptation could enhance our war efforts to the point where every man and woman in Pomerania would fear our horns and thirst for battle. By refining our tactics and adapting them for the modern battlefield, we can unleash a war machine that is rooted in tradition yet sharpened by necessity. Mastery on the battlefield will not only lead us to victory but also make Odin and the other gods proud. Dying in battle is the greatest honor, but fighting for our future and our offspring is the sacred duty that binds us to both our past and our destiny."

 JOM_cutting_trees_for_fleet: "Clearing Forests for Ships"
 JOM_cutting_trees_for_fleet_desc: "Along the western shores of Pomerania lie vast, ancient forests - deep and sacred, but their time has come. If we are to raise the great fleet we swore to the gods and our ancestors, the trees must fall. There can be no mercy, only axe and flame.\n\nOne hundred drakkars were promised - longships to carry us across the waters, back to the land of Western Pomerania. To reclaim and fulfil the saga written in our blood and history. The forests shall feed the forges, the shipyards shall thunder with toil, and from the roots of Midgard itself shall rise the legendary fleet that would make the Gods proud. "

 JOM_hit_run_doctrine: "Hit-and-Run Raids Doctrine"
 JOM_hit_run_doctrine_desc: "The strength of our kin has always been in the storm we bring - sudden, fierce, and gone before the dust can settle. We strike like thunder from a clear sky, with no warning, no mercy. One moment, the land is quiet; the next, the clash of steel, the roar of warriors, and fire licking the heavens.\n\nWe raid swiftly and vanish even swifter. While our foes scramble to understand what has happened, we are far away, sails full, laughing with the wind. And when they think they are safe again... we return, in another place, at another time, with the same fury."

 JOM_riverine_warfare: "Riverine Warfare"
 JOM_riverine_warfare_desc: "Langskips of every kind were crafted with such fierce brilliance that they could sail not only the vast, raging seas, but even reach the gods-forsaken shores of far-off Vinland, and glide just as easily through narrow fjords and winding rivers. Their hulls were built for both ocean wrath and inland cunning.\n\nThe Baltic lies behind us now, its waves conquered and forgotten. But ahead... ahead lies a land split by rivers, winding like serpents through the heart of our destiny. And just as before, our longships shall bear us forward, swift and silent, as axes bear down upon the necks of kings."

 JOM_fjm_karl_marx: "FJM Karl Marx"
 JOM_fjm_karl_marx_desc: "Our warband stands strong, an unbroken host of mighty Vikings, ready to seize the winding rivers of Pomerania with our fleet of proud drakkars. However, we are missing something. A longship worthy of sagas yet to be sung, leading our fleet like Fenrir at the head of the storm. We shall forge a vessel the likes of which Midgard has never seen, the mightiest drakkar ever carved from timber and iron. Named after the biggest advocate of basic workers' rights, Karl Marx, the vessel will make even Tyr himself proud. Let the rivers tremble beneath its keel."

 JOM_friggs_care: "Frigg's Care"
 JOM_friggs_care_desc: "Those who can no longer lift an axe or a shield shall never be cast aside. They are the hearth-keepers, the wisdom-bearers - the backbone of our tribe. It is they who raise the next generation of shieldmaidens and berserkers, who keep the fires burning when the warband marches to distant shores.\n\nLet none forget their sacrifice, for it is written in both scar and deed. And may Frigg, wise and gentle, bless them with strength and peace, so that when the horns fall silent and the swords are sheathed, we have a home worthy of our triumphs, and a people still standing to welcome us back."

 JOM_redistribute_loot: "Redistribution of Loot"
 JOM_redistribute_loot_desc: "The spoils of battle are not only for the Jarls. What our warriors seize with axe and fire must be shared with the folk. Let every man, woman, and child taste the fruits of our raids. When gold flows to all, no quarrels arise over how it was won. Thus, we stay strong, bound by blood, honour, and shared purpose. A true Viking victory is not measured by what one man takes, but by the feasting of the whole clan. Our strength is not only in the fury of the berserker, but in the bond of the shield wall and the unity of our people. That is how we shall endure."

 JOM_of_fish_and_mead: "Of Fish and Mead"
 JOM_of_fish_and_mead_desc: "The Viking diet was simple and harsh, shaped by the cold lands and the struggle to grow crops in the stony soil of the North.\n\nNow, we find ourselves in a similar plight. Until better days come, until the next harvest season, we must endure as our ancestors did: living off the fish of the sea, the honey from our hives, and whatever roots, berries, or wild herbs we can gather.\n\nIt may not be a feast fit for the gods, but it shall be enough to keep us strong, proud, and ready for the battles ahead."

 JOM_free_thralls: "Free the Thralls"
 JOM_free_thralls_desc: "The Vikings of old held an ambivalent view of slavery... but we shall not bear such a stain. Though we wear the furs and wield the axes of our ancestors, we care about the oppressed. We are not conquerors alone; we are a liberation army.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must march upon the reeducation camps across the former lands of the Eurokommissariats. We shall break their gates, tear down their fences, and set free every soul within. Political prisoners, forced laborers, and all those chained by the German yoke shall walk free again."

 JOM_power_of_njordr: "Power of Njörðr"
 JOM_power_of_njordr_desc: "Njörðr, warden of wind and wave, shall be the one to whom we offer our toil. As he calms storms and guides ships to safe shores, so too shall he guide our hands as we harness the breath of the sea and the song of the skies.\n\nLet the windmills turn in his name, and the waters flow with his blessing. May his favor bring us warmth in the frostbitten dark and light in the long winter nights. In his might, we shall not burn forests nor dig deep into the bones of the earth, but rise with the power of nature itself, as true sons and daughters of the North."

 JOM_establish_trades_routes: "Establish the Sea Trade Routes"
 JOM_establish_trades_routes_desc: "The sea is a gift from the gods, and it offers us more than just an escape from the madness ashore. Aye, we could raise our sails and vanish into the horizon, leaving the land of the Wends behind in smoke and ruin, but there is greater glory to achieve.\n\nWith wind at our backs and Njordr's blessing, we shall begin to trade, modest at first - small ships, scattered goods. But in time, our voyages shall become the sole lifeline between the world and this shattered coast. Then it will be we who name the price. Riches shall flow to those bold enough to brave the waves, and no one braves them like the sons and daughters of the North."

 JOM_great_serpent: "The Great Serpent Jörmungandr"
 JOM_great_serpent_desc: "The great serpent Jormungandr, wearing the guise of chieftain Tusk, coils himself around our native land, seeking to strangle all sparks of defiance that rise against him and his hordes.\nHis venom has poisoned all life in these lands, and his fangs have pierced through the very sinews of a once-proud people, binding them in an iron grip.\n\nFor all his wicked deeds - for the injustice dealt to our chieftain Sandbjerg and to our kin - he shall pay. And payment shall be in blood, for he is a merchant of slaughter, a peddler of ruin. So shall justice be done, when the villain tastes the edge of his own blade. And we - we shall strike the head from the invading beast, ending this age of terror.\n\nFreedom gained from this malicious wyrm shall be sweeter than the best meads."

 JOM_heartless_liberals: "Heartless Liberals"
 JOM_heartless_liberals_desc: "You - who bore banners of liberation,\nYou - who cloaked their true faces and slithered through the shadows, as cunning as the Trickster himself.\nYou deceived the folk who saw in you salvation, counting on the arm of justice to never reach you, sheltered by the might of the Southerner hordes.\n\nBut now we - we bring judgment. We accuse you of betraying the gods, \nOf betraying all that we hold dear, of betraying your own blood and name.\nLoki himself would call you kin.\nBut the people - they will not forget.\nAnd we... we shall let them pass their sentence.\nFor the law we fight for must bear teeth -\nAnd all who turned their eyes from wickedness shall suffer.\nAnd those who gave the orders...\n\nThere can be only one verdict."

 JOM_convert_settlers: "Conversions of the Settlers"
 JOM_convert_settlers_desc: "You were summoned not to preserve, but to break - to shatter what once stood here,\nTo reclaim what your forebears lost, to raise a new world from the ruins of the old.\nYou are victims of the zeitgeist, burdened with the weight of choices made far from these shores. But you must not yield to this cruel turning of fate.\n\nYou are our Germanic brothers.\nAwake!\nAwake - and remember your roots, reaching deep into the foundations of Yggdrasil.\nLook inward, to the soul within, and hear the voice of the Allfather!\nIn this dreadful storm, do you not hear Thor striking his anvil?\nDo you not feel the grace of Frigg when your thoughts turn to kin and hearth?\n\nThere is still hope for your redemption. Join us.\nReclaim the legacy of your true ancestors - and Midgard shall be made whole once more. Together."

 JOM_blood_eagle_traitors: "Blood Eagle for the Traitors"
 JOM_blood_eagle_traitors_desc: "From the great eyrie of eagles you claim your line. Upon your banners soared the eagle.\nAnd behind its wings you hid your cruelties. Wielding it as shield and spear alike.\nThat single symbol was to bend the people's knee, to force the land itself to bow to your will.\nBut you bled the eagle dry, and cursed it to wear a cloak of shame for all eternity.\n\nSo shall your fate be the eagle's. The blood-eagle.\n\nThere can be no mercy for those who sold their kin into chains, all for the pale illusion of power. No skald shall sing your name. No mother shall speak of you but to warn her child.\nAnd the gods shall never again let you cross the gates of Valhalla."

 JOM_burstaborg_siege: "Siege of Burstaborg"
 JOM_burstaborg_siege_desc: "At the mouth of the Oder stands a stone-born monstrosity, named Szczecin by men.\nWithin the walls of this giant dwells hoarded treasure, piled high by the greedy hands of the outlaws from Hansa. How many swords and axes, how many winters' worth of bread could be bought with such a mountain of gold?\n\nNot even the dwarves of legend matched the lust of the bankers and merchants who bartered souls for silver in this cursed place. To seize this hold is no mere raid - It is the turning of the tide, a blow that grants us the river's heart and carves open the veins of Wendia. But the gold...the gold cries louder than the river itself. For our folk await not just conquest, but justice. And justice weighs its scales in coin and flame alike."

 JOM_summer_gone: "Summer is Ending"
 JOM_summer_gone_desc: "Not all that glitters is gold, and not all born in Szczecin are sold. In the bowels of that stony giant, dwell some who still follow the red northern star - that old sign of freedom, equality, and brotherhood, carried southward by the Summer Union.\n\nAmong their ranks walk many who might yet stand beside us, shoulder to shoulder. They served a false tyrant, but not by choice. Now we offer them that freedom: To cast down hollow idols and embrace the truth that Allfather Odin whispers to all who dare listen with open hearts.\n\nIt will take many moons, and the Oder will run long before they earn the right to be called sons and daughters of the North. But should their will prove pure, clear as glacial spring - then our hearths shall open, and our kin shall call them family."

 JOM_sack_the_city: "§RSACK THE CITY§!"
 JOM_sack_the_city_desc: "There is no scent sweeter than that of a burning city at dawn. This... this is what justice smells like. Too much gold has been hoarded in the coffers of the mighty lords of Szczecin for our warriors to pass by in silence. Behind their walls lie many homes - and in them, the innocent. The gods have forbidden us from touching them. Vengeance must be reserved for those who poisoned this land with their decaying creed, for those who fattened their bellies on the backs of the weary.\n\nWhen the day is done, a crimson glow will rise over Burstaborg, and the guilty shall drown in their own blood. Yet the morning that follows - that sacred dawn - shall bring rebirth.\nAnd with it, a purging fire to cleanse us all from the mistakes of the past."

 JOM_steel_longships: "Steel Longships from the Shipyards"
 JOM_steel_longships_desc: "Our dragon-ships, which carried us across the shadowed sea, are no mere vessels - they are the will of the gods made manifest. Thor, in his thunderous glory, and Njordr, lord of winds and tides, guided us to this shore, that we may fulfill our fate.\nYet in the heart of the city - in Burstaborg - lies a gift far greater than even the most faithful skald could dream:\n\nForges. Colossal forges that spew forth iron beasts. Forges that could build ships to sail not just the sea - but the Nine Realms themselves! We must awaken their fire again, stoke the flame beneath their ancient hearths. For only Odin knows what monstrous marvels our master-smiths shall forge. And the metal they shape - by sweat, by blood, by prayer - shall endure even the wrath of Surtr himself."

 JOM_islanders_of_swinmunnir: "Islanders Of Svinmunnir"
 JOM_islanders_of_swinmunnir_desc: "Svinmunnir stands as the second great pillar of our seafaring strength after Szczecin. Its harbors and shipyards are the key to forging a fleet worthy of our ambitions, a fleet that will secure our dominance across the Baltic.\n\nBut there is more at stake than ships and salt winds. The cursed sons of Germania may yet seek to crawl back to these shores like wretched draugar. That cannot be allowed. By Odin's will, this land shall never again bow to foreign rule.\n\nNot all is lost to treachery; the red banners still fly over the city. The leftist clans hold power, and if guided by wisdom, there may be words instead of war."

 JOM_companions_of_socialism: "Companions of Socialism"
 JOM_companions_of_socialism_desc: "Many former members of the SLD, who have long wandered in the fog of forgotten ideals, now see the flame of true faith burning bright once more. They come forth, heads bowed, ready to cast aside old, hollow dogmas and embrace the righteous Nordic path. If they are willing to swear their oaths before the gods and take up axe or plough for our cause, then let them find a place in our halls. Even the lost may serve the will of Odin and work to accomplish the true vision of Nordic Socialism."

 JOM_heregeld_or_enlistment: "Heregeld or Enlistment"
 JOM_heregeld_or_enlistment_desc: "In recognition of their past loyalty to the ideals of socialism, we offer the people of Svinmunnir a final choice. They may pay the heregeld, a tribute for the forging of our longships and the sharpening of our spears, or they can take up shield and axe to join our warbands in glorious battle. Those who choose to fight will earn their place in the sagas, while those who pay will still serve our cause. Let it be clear: in this age of fire and storm, no one shall remain indifferent to our cause. "

 JOM_our_window_to_world: "Our Window to the World"
 JOM_our_window_to_world_desc: "Svinmunnir, as has been made clear, is our window to the world and now the gateway to our destiny. With its extensive transshipment docks, formidable naval facilities, and the gas terminal that fuels not only ships but also the fire in our hearts, it encompasses everything a true seafarer and modern Viking could dream of.\n\nThis city is a stronghold, a place of creation, and a launching point for many drakkars. From here, our longships will again command the seas, our warriors will journey to distant shores, and our Vikings will return with wealth to support our people."

 JOM_falling_nidhoggr: "Falling the Níðhöggr"
 JOM_falling_nidhoggr_desc: "These so-called Brothers Comrades are foes not only of the people but also blasphemers in the eyes of the old gods. Maciej Poręba, Eugeniusz Sendecki, and Aleksander Jabłonowski will taste the wrath of Thor when our hammers crash down upon their skulls.\n\nTheir petty empire of lies and fascist pride will crumble beneath our feet. With a single, thundering battle cry, our warriors shall storm their halls like wolves in the night, and with one mighty swing of our axes, we will bring their dominion to ruin. Let the ravens feast, for the gods have chosen our path, and no tyrant shall stand in our way."

 JOM_wolfs_holmgang: "The Wolf's Holmgang"
 JOM_wolfs_holmgang_desc: "Aleksander Jabłonowski, known as Jaszczur, is often labeled as a traitor, spy, and enemy of the people. He has betrayed his country and acted against his own people, making it difficult to find any redeeming qualities in him. However, one aspect we cannot overlook is his bravery. The holmgang, a traditional duel, between Jarl Halfdan and Jabłonowski will occur soon. It is said that Jaszczur faces this challenge without fear, preparing for the fight with a smile. His courage is reminiscent of the bravest warriors of Odin. May the Gods protect our Jarl and grant him the strength of Thor to defeat this madman. "

 JOM_hammer_of_rainbow_vikings: "Hammer of Rainbow Vikings"
 JOM_hammer_of_rainbow_vikings_desc: "The Lizardman's forces wage war not like true warriors, but like shadows in the night. In the dense woods, they lurk like wolves too cowardly to show their fangs. Their ambushes strike swiftly and cruelly, felling even our fiercest berserkers before they can lift their axes. It is war without glory and without honor.\n\nThis reeks of Loki's mischief, serving as a test of spirit and resolve. Our men dread those cursed forests, for there is no shield wall, no war cry, only silence, traps, and death lurking behind. But we are sons of the North, and though they slither in the darkness, we shall meet them with fire and wrath until their cunning is no more."

 JOM_forge_of_warriors: "Forge of the Warriors"
 JOM_forge_of_warriors_desc: "Though the Lizardman's army is cursed and treacherous, it serves as a crucible where only the strongest will endure. Let no one despair, for in the eyes of the gods, hardship is merely a forge in which true warriors are shaped. Those who emerge from the shadowed forests, bloodied but unbroken, shall earn glory beyond measure. The weak will fall, while the worthy shall rise. What emerges from these cursed woods will not be an ordinary raider, but a hardened champion of Odin, a chosen of Tyr, blessed by Freyja's gaze. Let the trials begin; from them will rise the fiercest warriors of our age and seal the doom of the Lizardman."

 JOM_push_back_skraelings: "Pushing Back the Skraelings"

Funded with silver from the foul halls of Trump's America, they now crawl along the coasts, mimicking our raids, and might, but without the honor and blessing of the gods.\n\nThey bring fear like a fog, creeping and choking, but we shall answer with fire and fury. Let us cast them beyond the ocean, back to their land of greed and deceit. Let Thor's hammer fall upon them, and let our axes sing with vengeance.

There shall be no escape, no salvation. Not a single boat carrying reinforcements or supplies will slip through our grip.\n\nWe will cast a net of steel and fire across the waters, and once caught, the Skrælingar shall not be freed.

We will send forth our warriors with steel. Enlightenment will not come from empty debates, but from the sound of bone fracturing and axes striking the earth.

We will discard the false comfort of agrotourism like a broken shield and restore the land to its true purpose: to feed our people. We will move the herds, build longhouses of stone and timber, and till the soil with the strength of many warriors.

And we must seize this moment.\n\n We shall extract all that is useful from this so-called humanitarian mission. Let the United Nations grumble and gnash their teeth; their distant fury matters little compared to the steel and supplies we can gain on the ground.

Many times, history has witnessed the artificial forging of nations - patched together with lies or force, crumbling under the weight of their own absurdity. But this... this is different. This is a natural synthesis. The awakening of a primal fragment within us all - an elemental truth glimpsed only by those brave enough to peer deep into the human soul, beyond lineage, beyond ancestry.\n\nTo be Jomswend is not to be born - it is to become. A creation so pure, so precise, that it calls out to those lost in the fog of modernity. It is a new pantheon - Nordic in essence, modern in unity - where belonging is forged not by geography, but by belief. Belief in the ideals. Loyalty to the community. Readiness to defend it - against the rot from beyond.\nYou are not Jomswend because your parents were.\nYou are Jomswend because you choose to be."

A temple not of light, but of blood - spilled by the innocent, forgotten by the world. They drape themselves in the rags of holiness, speak of service to God, preach of sacred morality - yet behind the altar lies exploitation, and in the confession booth, control.\n\nYou bewitched an entire people, turned them into a herd of docile sheep, ripe for milking - their gold, their sweat, their dignity. You call yourselves shepherds, but all you ever did was feed on the flock. You speak with false tongues on matters you neither understand nor have right to judge. You dictate thought, limit freedom, shackle will. You dare claim the voice of the One True God. But Odin said no such thing. The gods of old watch you from high halls - and they spit in your direction.\n\nTheir message is clear. Their wrath, stirring.\nFor every chain you placed upon us— you will pay in iron."

This is no superstition, no quaint tale buried by the march of capital and concrete. This is a living gift, a thread that ties spirit to spirit, allowing those chosen to gaze beyond skin and bone, into the very essence of a being - its energy, its aura, its pain. They read the signs etched in stone and soil, in the wind whispering through the branches, in the howls of beasts and the paths of stars. From these voices of nature, they learn of what was, what aches now, and what shadows or light lie ahead.\n\nThrough them, the gods speak. They offer omens, warnings, and blessings - but it is up to us to listen, to understand, and to shape our fate from the truth they reveal."

 JOM_rebirth_of_old_faith_desc: "The faith of our ancestors has faded into a spiritual fog. Yes - there are many who call themselves Norse pagans. Ásatrú. Nordic folk believers. But too often, these paths are poisoned - twisted by the far right, or emptied of meaning, turned into lifeless rituals with no soul behind them. Even the gods... Even Odin, Thor, Freyja -  have been sold like cheap trinkets. Dragged into comic books, turned into mascots, stripped of mystery, turned into noise for the masses. Ask around - everyone's heard of the Vikings. Few believe they ever prayed, or bled, or wept for their gods as we do now. Few feel the sacred breath of the old ways still stirring in their chests.\n\nBut we do. And we must restore it. Not as an echo, but as a living, burning truth to be centralized, renewed, and carried across the world. Because the nordic spark lives in all of us - buried, maybe, but never gone. It is a truth born of nature, and it is time to awaken it."

 JOM_magical_rituals: "Religious and Magical Rituals"

And sure - our modern world may scoff at that. They call themselves too enlightened for symbols, too civilized for blood. But maybe... every now and then, a sheep must be offered. Or an enemy. A little ancient fire never hurt a society that's forgotten how to feel.\n\nAt first, they'll look at us like we're mad. But that will change. It always does. When they see that our path leads to victory, to order, to a future forged in unity and purpose, they'll understand: That what binds our people isn't just faith in the gods - but faith in the power all around us, and above all, in each other. Bound not by law or contract, but by blood, ritual, unbreakable brotherhood and friendship. Because friendship is magic."

A call that comes not from the mouths of men, but from deep within. Our faith speaks to them. Not through sermons or slogans, but through the pulse of the earth, the whisper of wind across stone, the roar of a storm that sounds like memory. They come to us in droves - tired of being owned, tired of kneeling to hollow men. They cast off their collars, and walk barefoot into the truth.\n\nIt's heartening. It's powerful. And - truth be told - it's more than we expected. We'll need more temples than we dared dream. More priests. More hands to guide, to build, to teach. Because this faith - our faith - is not a Sunday affair. It is not a habit. It is a people, a living force, a bond that stretches across blood, sky, and bone."

Hidden veins of artisanal tradition, subtle techniques, local craftworks that still glow with ancient spirit. We must fan those embers - let them burn bright again.\n\nTo build our industry is to shield our people. To forge arms is to forge security. Every hammer strike, every nail driven, every barrel sealed is not just for today - it is an offering to the future of Jomsborg.

There will be no more backdoor subsidies for corporate interests. We will halt the sell-off of municipal housing and invest significantly in renovating what remains, giving tenants real control over their buildings.\n\nAt the same time, we will empower residents by supporting housing cooperatives, breaking up large structures, and limiting leadership terms to prevent stagnation. Public land will be used to serve communities, not for private gain. "

 jomsborg.3.desc: "Every few days, more news about EKW's downfall reach us. Today's news, however, have been... quite unorthodox. Apparently, Pomeranian regional  media are informing about... a Viking raid on Kamień Pomorski. \n\nThe norsemen were led by Adrian Zandberg (apparently referred to as Halfdan Sandbjerg by his  men), whom it looks like have finally returned back to the country after his exodus to Bornholm following the conflict between him and the Eurokommissariat's  government. After his public denunciations of EKs' inner patologies and shady deals ultimately resulted in his arrest and a police raid on his house, Zandberg made  a speech on how not even the EU is able to save the failed concept that is Poland, and that in order to build a respectable state, Polish identity as a whole needs  to be replaced with a more noble, Nordic one."

 jomsborg.4.t: "Valkiries Calling"
 jomsborg.4.desc: "A battered, robust man stands upon the shores of Bornholm. His eyes are fixed on the south, to the lands that caused him much pain. That didn't stop him, however. Like a true warrior, he emerged stronger. The beatings from guards hardened his flesh. Fights with other prisoners helped him refine his technique. Through the bloodied eyes, he could see much clearer than before. He finally saw how the mask of humanity falls from capital, revealing the face of Fáfnir. He realised the system needed to be burned down to the ground and built anew.\nHis lust for vengeance didn't, however, blind him to the reality. The Eurolǫg still controlled a vast portion of his second homeland. He was sure the fragile order would soon crumble, but... It's been two years, and the German order seems unmovable. That gives time for his All-Army to grow and train, but they, too, grow restless. Restless and too massive to feed without terrorizing the local population. Because of Grucela, unsure at first at the idea of invasion, now urges haste and perhaps strike at the Vistula estuary region or sail through the strait of Piława. He doesn't realize it would be too dangerous. Besides, it has to be Wolin. Thankfully, his war leader, Adam Kościelak, agrees with him on that matter wholeheartedly. Biejat and Zawisza prefer to remain silent on that matter, although on the last council meeting, she snarkily noticed that, soon, they'll have to conquer Bornholm and declare independence.\nAt least the immediate problems eclipsed the long-term challenges that gnawed at his mind. The creation of his Great Northern Army and transforming Poland into an ideal society was, fortunately, a headache of tomorrow. Still, that wasn't the greatest of his worries. It has become apparent that despite dedication to moots and cooperation of equals, the future of the movement rested on him alone - the Carmine Jarl of Fólkvangr. People perceived him and admired him as a monarch. However, he knew all too well what happens when so much relies on a powerful individual. While he was sure he couldn't be corrupted, he started to believe his mind was slipping. He found ancient runes written in the soil and in his journal, despite not learning them before. Sometimes, when he stood on the shore, he often saw sea monsters on the horizon, and when he looked at the water, he found his reflection to be blurry despite the water being still."

 jomsborg.5.desc: "Far away from all the chaos of the European mainland, surrounded by the cold and tempestuous waters of the Baltic, a Danish island of Bornholm had its place. It's a calm and peaceful islet where life goes on slowly, away from busy center of Denmark. In their bliss, or maybe ignorance and blind trust, the islanders of Bornholm gave refuge to a group of refugees from Poland. Plenty of time has passed since the European intervention took place and numerous boats disembarked upon beaches near Svaneke. Locals, at first somewhat concerned, have eased their tense outlook after the leader of the Poles - Adrian Zandberg greeted them in their native Danish tounge, despite the welcoming speech being simple and very rusty. \n \n To not cause any trouble, the refuges formed a small commune just outside the town, building wooden huts out of any scraps they could scrounge up. As months passed the settlement grew in size, soon named Folkvangr, after the mythical refuge for fallen warriors ruled by goddess Freyja. Entirety of the village centered itself around the longhouse built out of discarded shipping containers - Sessrúmnir, where the Carmine Jarl held his meetings, and after dark planned his grand return. With a growing population soon came a need for a blacksmith, fishermen, shipwrights and traders who knew at least three words in Danish. Albeit small and desolate, the village of Folkvangr held an indominable spirit of determination, as each evening, when the sun set, the villagers gathered around the campfire to sing tales of the old lands, the ones stolen from them, and the ones they will take back. \n \n With time, the viking spirit started to spread throughout the community, as they all gravitated to the wise, yet sometimes unstable leader. As his mental strain increased, no doubt caused by years of unsuccessful attempts of peacefully taking over and improving the state of Poland, soon cracks started to show. The new identity of Halfdan Sandbjerg took root in the cracks of his mind, a stern viking high chief who would not bend a knee to anyone was needed to unite his broken, but faithful warriors and bring them back into glorious warfare against western invaders. \n \n With his personality shifted, a Great Temple of Odin was raised beside the longhouse, where Gothis appointed by him would lead ceremonies in the name of the Allfather. The adamant high chief Sandbjerg now looks upon his fledging settlement of lost but faithful souls, as he stands upon a hill, watching yet another drakkar take shape in the \"shipyard\". Soon the Viking warriors of Folkvangr shall sail south, and write a saga worthy of Valhalla!"

 jomsborg.8.desc: "Quiet skies above Bornholm, normally cloudy and peaceful, were broken by loud juddering of a helicopter. Rotor blades slashed through the morning fog as the Danish Royal Coast Guard aircraft made its way towards the anomalous settlement on the Eastern coast of the Island. Aboard it, sat Mikkel Rasmunsen, deputy officer of Capital Region Administration, a person not important enough to hold a position in the Copenhagen council, yet important enough to be sent out to investigate reports about a weird village somewhere in the Baltic backwaters of the Kingdom. He sat in the back of a Coast Guard helicopter with a folder full of wild descriptions of a \"wild Norsemen LARP Group\" setting up a permanent settlement outside Sveneke in one hand, and his temples in another. He cursed to himself that this is not what he spent years on best Copenhagen universities for. Soon however his angry meditation was interrupted by the pilot. \n \n - Deputy, sir, we're almost there. \n \n Looking outside the window, his eyes widened and eyebrows lifted high. Reports weren't exaggarated, it truly was a ragtag group of Viking LARPers living in a real norse temple tribe, however crude. The arrival of a \"shrieking silver bird\" caused quite a commotion in the village, as both men, women and children crowded outside their wood-mud huts pointing, waving and cowering before the \"monster\". \n \n - Put us down, I need to see this up close. - Mikkel spoke, in a feat of bewildered curiosity. \n - Yes, sir. - Pilot responded, proceeding to set down the helicopter upon an empty field nearby the village. \n \n As the rotors kicked up clouds of dust around the landing site, nearly all wildly infatuated villagers surrounded the aircraft, some bearing crude, rusty axes in their shaking hands. Mikkel opened the sliding side door as soon as the helicopter's wheels touched the ground, holding onto his folder tightly. Women and children shouted in fear, as the man in black exited the \"bird's belly\". The Danish deputy truly looked out of place in his suit, surrounded by unshaven Viking cosplayers covered in blankets and ripped up carpets. The remaining bravest of the men formed a shaking shield wall formation, and braced for a fight. Thankfully before anything bad happened, a tall and burly man emerged from the formation, other warriors cowered before him in respect. \n \n - Vælkomin outsider! - his boomy voice echoed around as he spread his arms in welcome, speaking very crude Danish. - Allfather be praised, messenger of Huginn and Muninn, I welcome you to Folkvangr! \n \n The atmosphere surrounding the landing site eased quickly, as shields and axes were lowered. Mikkel stood quite shocked, but quickly snapped back, fixed his suit and approached the Jarl who bore a long Carmine cape. Chief of the tribe was nearly elated, that his actions brought the attention of Odin's Ravens, as he led the deputy towards the longhouse in the center of the village. Mikkel reckoned, it would be in his best interest to simply play along and report what he saw afterwards."

Villagers gathered around the broken container which housed the melting kiln, watching as the work in the smithy continued every day, preparing weapons and armour for the upcoming invasion. Any item even vaguely metallic in nature that wasn't bolted to the ground by the Danish natives of the island, was subsequently acquired and repurposed by the Folkvangr host. Scrap melted in the steel kiln was the backbone of the settlements rearmament effort. \n \n Sitting on a stump nearby, an experienced warrior Bjorn was taking a moment to sharpen his trusty axe. The forge running day and night, required large amounts of wood and him, among other warriors on rotation helped in cutting wood logs for the fire. Each slide of the whetstone sent sparks onto the chilled ground. He longed for a return to the lands he, along with the rest of the tribe were exiled from, so each day he volunteered for extra work, to ensure the success of upcoming strife. Focused on his axe, and somewhat sleep deprived for weeks on end, he failed to notice the towering figure approaching him. \n \n - Ver heill ok sæll, Brother Bjorn. - A deep voice greeted him, bringing him up to attention. \n - Hail Jarl Halfdan! - He got up and holstered his axe, after which he placed his hand on his chest and bowed his head, noticing none other than the Chief of the tribe. \n - No need for bowing, brother. - Jarl quite roughly pat Bjorn's shoulder and gave him a reassuring smile from underneath his burly beard. - I had hoped you'd have some time to speak, in the Longhouse. \n - For you, anything, my Jarl. - He nodded, and followed his leader. \n \n With each step, the chainmail of the Jarl, made out of melted pots and pans clanged, magnifying his already dominating presence. His carmine cape flapped in the chilly seashore breeze. \n - The gods have noticed your sacrifice for the cause, and so have I. - Jarl spoke calmly, as the two arrived at the Longhouse. - You've been at my side longer than most. \n - Yes, Chief, even before the heathenous bastards exiled us. - His fists tightened, at the sheer thought. \n - Soon, my brother, soon. - he said reassuringly as the two entered through the doors. \n \n Inside, a group of elite warriors awaited them, bearing carmine shields and gjermundbu helmets. The troope bowed their heads before the Jarl, as he turned to Bjorn. \n - I wish for you, to join the ranks of my huskarls, and fight our foes in the name of Odin. \n - I'd be honoured to, my Jarl. - Bjorn bowed as Halfdan Sandbjerg himself, bestowed a housecarl helmet upon his head. \n The warriors cheered three times, \"skál! skál! skál!\", welcoming a new face among their ranks."

A village on the coast of the Baltic Sea like any other, made its living from tourism, however after the Eurocorps intervention, whole industry went silent seemingly overnight. Nowadays it's populated by a fraction of its original inhabitants, people either too proud, or too poor to leave and try to find a way to live in the new reality. \n \n Jan, a young adult native to the village, layed upon his bed and stared at the ceiling. He remained behind in a decrepid wooden hut to take care of his sickly grandma, after his brother disappeared, and his friends scattered among towns and cities of the region. In his insomnia induced rambling, he cursed the political establishment that led to how the country ended up. He rolled onto his side, and looked at the wall, onto which he taped an old, faded poster, carmine shade of which brought him peace, and reminded him of the time he and his brother used to be volunteers for Razem Party, years ago. Maybe this nostalgia was what made him believe in the rumours coursing throughout the village and beyond. That the exiled leader is very much still around, and has not forsaken his mission. With a sigh, he got up and rubbed his sleep deprived eyes. Stealthily, he snuck out of the hut, and walked towards the beach, hoping that the sea would bring him some respite. He sat down on the cold sand, and closed his eyes, listening to waves break against the shore. In this moment, he only wished for a sign, that things will change soon. \n \n Suddenly, he heard a sound of old wood hitting the sand. He opened his eyes, and saw a truly unusual sight, a boat, with a crudely carved dragon head on the bow. Two burly, bearded men clad in rough carpets coloured with carmine paint, jumped out and pulled the boat ashore. Jan was taken aback, but, the familiarly painted capes worn by the sailors ignited something in him. He ran up to them, tripping on the sand dunes. \n \n - Brother Ivarr, I'm glad to see you once more. - One of the men kneeled beside him, and reached his hand forward. \n - Zygmunt? Is that you, brother? - Jan took his hand, he remembered that face . \n - Agmundr now, brother. - The two siblings embraced tightly. - Odin be praised you're alright. \n - Where have you been? What's going on with this get-up? - Jan spoke in shocked surprise. \n - No time for explanation, brother, trust in Mimir's wisdom, and prepare for our return. Spread the word, Agent of Loki, for your past efforts haven't been forgotten. \n \n Ivarr stood up, with renewed determination. With a stern look on his face he nodded to his brother. Now him, alongside countless past volunteers were activated as sleeper agents, sowing a seed of revolution, before the return of the Carmine Jarl."

In normal circumstances, a few loud Poles on motorboats and jet skis would've resulted in a laugh from the proud German naval officer. But these circumstances weren't normal. The German army occupied hostile lands and was attacked from all sides. In this moment, the motorboats were as fierce as every drakkar, the shouting men were as good as any berserker. Among them was Oskar Węgorz, who recently changed his name to Öskuldr Ormríbrók and soon would try to prove himself in a baptism of battle.\nThe shores of Poland were getting closer and closer. Oskyldr couldn't wait to return to strike with vengeance at those who attacked Poland and at those who made it weak in the first place. His heart started beating faster.\nJust as the war council had expected, the Germans were too preoccupied with fighting against the land forces to expect a naval invasion. Good. Öskuldr and his squadmates started preparing a Molotov cocktail as the driver of his motorboat was getting closer to the Euroadmilarity's watercraft. When they got close enough, the flaming bottles flew towards the enemy boat, engulfing it with fire. The first point was scored. The Germans realised what was going on, but were too busy with retreating to secure positions to defend themselves. Only the sentries were able to fire consistently. Fortunately, Öskuldr's squad had a dedicated rifleman, who was able to answer lead with lead. Still, there was no time for careful dispatch of the coastal guard. The Germans had the invaders outgunned, and that meant the Norsemen had to advance right now before the defenders had a chance to regroup.\nWith a loud shout, Öskuldr, axe in hand, rushed to the beach with many other Vikings to chase the retreating Germans. Above his head flew the thrown axes, arrows, and few occasional bullets. He caught up to a wounded German soldier and cleft his head before he could shoot. With no time to appreciate the kill, he ran towards the enemy's sandbag wall toward a soldier, too preoccupied with shooting another attacker to notice Norseman's charge. For that, an axe crushed his head. Öskuldr jumped through the sandbags and struck another soldier. This one managed to block the attack with his carbine. With all his strength, the Viking pulled the carbine out of the German's hand thanks to the hooked blade of his weapon. He hit eurosoldier's nose with his forehead and followed with an axe strike at the stomach. His opponent fell to the ground. Öskuldr looked at the beach. His brothers in arms succeeded in other parts of the coast. The sound of a brass horn signalled a success."

 jomsborg.12.desc: "Father Paweł Michniewicz often prayed that God would topple the Germans and drive them away from Poland. He harboured hatred in his heart. He now realised there were worse evils to plague the land of Gryffins. The ones that come from the sea. After he heard of the heathens' advance and their marauding campaign, he realised that. He tried to atone for his anger by offering shelter for the wounded soldiers of the Admiralty. Even then, he didn't feel purified.\nI did it out of fear - he once said to his confessor, Father Marek Kuligowski - Out of fear and because I calculated that the Lizard Union would not come to our rescue in time. That's not how true regret should look.\nIf he was guilty of sin, let him answer for it! Would God strike at the heart of Pomeranian Christianity solely because of one parish's misdeeds?\nThe Norsemen came during the night. The screams of the last demoralized German soldiers protecting the church could be heard behind the church doors. After the Vikings were done with the defenders, they began striking at the church door with their axes.\n*Crack*\nFather Michniewicz made his last prayers.\n*Crack*\nThe wild screams of the invaders terrified all those who came to find solace and protection in the church.\n*Crack*\nThey broke through. Those who tried to resist them were cut down. Then they turned against the wounded. No German was to be left alive.\nSomething in Paweł broke. He left everyone to fend for themselves. He ran to the farthest depth of the church. He hid behind the sculpture of an archangel Michael. In those brief moments of refuge, he didn't find any peace. He could hear steps getting louder and louder. With them came the sound of looting. Priest, dripping in sweat, tried to calm his breath so they wouldn't find him. The Vikings passed him and headed to the crypts of Pomeranian dukes.\nFather Paweł decided to remain hidden. Trying to connect his thoughts, he devised a plan to get to his family in Unibórz.\nWe missed one - the Viking, who finished the grave robbing, unfortunately noticed the hiding priest.\nThe other reached toward the priest and grabbed him. One hit with an armored glove prevented Paweł from resisting. They dragged him through the main church hall, where he saw the Vikings trying to undo 900 years of Pomeranian Christian history.\nThe Viking that caught him raised a hammer over the priests head."

A harsh fever combined with the wounds he received during the fighting, as well as a wariness that came from planning the invasion, took its toll. He had to heal in his bed.\nStill, a guilty conscience was more nagging than the physical ailments. In the dark of the night, he woke up and decided he needed to see the necropolis. He departed without his guards and departed in a simple nightshirt.\nOn top of the hill, he saw burial mounds marked with white stones and an extinguished fireplace - a sign of his followers' finished Blót. He looked closer at the remaining embers. To his surprise, they formed words written in runes - ARALD CVRMSVN. Only now did he feel how cold it was outside. Something wasn't right. The dead were upset.\nHe saw the ashes coming from the mounds and forming a whirlwind. Jarl covered his eyes with his arms.\nThen, before him, 13 undead draugrs formed from the ashes. One king with rotten teeth and 12 huskarls with ropes hanging from their necks.\n- We are Harald Gormson, known as Bluetooth, king of the Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, and Aldinburg. You have rejected the calling of Odin - harsh, hissing voice came from the undead mouth.\n- I am Adrian Zanberg, and I know you. -Jarl replied with stounch voice- Who are you to talk about the will of Odin. You disregarded him to follow Christ.\n- I did, and for that, my soul, our soul, lies in Hel, wasting with other weaklings. The same awaits you as well unless you accept my spirit and let your true nature take reign.\n- I would never do that.\n- You almost did. Back in the prison. Remember the blinding berserker's rage when you defended yourself in fights. It was your true nature trying to communicate with you.\n- I know you.  You want to bring destruction, death, and rape upon all of the world. I want to help people. Elevate them from suffering.\n- Look around. All those things are already here in Wendland. Only by accepting your destiny will you be able to show your subjects how to survive in this new age.\nZandberg couldn't find a response to this.\n- Think of their afterlife as well. What good is 50 years of comfort, if it results in millennia of darkness of Hel? You want to help people? Help me. Let my soul enter your empty husk of a body, so I can find redemption as a warrior.\nJarl's silence was enough of a response to the apparition.\n-I know, you'll make the right decision. As a sign of my goodwill, accept the gift I brought you from Eir.\nJarl woke up in his bed. Drenched in sweat, but in impeccable health."

He rarely attended feasts or sang with his fellow warriors.\nSome thought that he wouldn't rest until all of the German menace was driven back through the Oder. Still, some of the jarl's excesses made people doubt that ferociousness guided him.\n\nZandberg stood at the entrance to the training camp for a discreet inspection. Men stationed there were training hand-to-hand combat in two teams. One team quickly incapacitated most of the other. Only one fighter remained. He wasn't going to give up, and the other team ganged up on him.\n-I give up - he shouted, lying on the ground, kicked and beaten by his opponents.\n-Enough! - Zandberg wanted to shout, but the words froze in his mouth. He knew the image of a helpless victim being beaten all too well. His heart began racing in his chest. His breath quickened.\n-Stop this! - He finally managed to utter the words. More panicked than anyone expected. The fight stopped as everyone turned their heads toward the jarl. The camp leader probably scolded the winning team. Zandberg wasn't sure as he walked out of the camp, marching quickly.\n\n- The Mighty Dane lies on the floor! - That's how Zandberg's torturer began every interrogation. Why was he hearing his raspy voice again? - Tell me the name of the leader of the Szczecin Razem cell.\nThen came the collective beatings.\n\n- The Mighty Dane lies on the floor! Tell me where Grucela is hiding?\nA kick to the head.\n\n- The Mighty Dane lies on the floor! Tell me where Bosak is hiding?\nA punch to the gut. \nRunning amok, Zandberg finally found himself in his personal tent. Inside, he tried to stabilize his breath, but the images, the sensations wouldn't go away. The pain of the beatings, the sights of other prisoners being tortured. The crooked smile of the torturer.\n-Damn bastard tore a hole in my head after all... If I see him again, I'll carve him one of his own! - Zandberg thought trying to find some reassurance. The momentary euphoria of the imaginary retribution passed as quickly as it appeared - Is there no end to this torment?\n'You know the truth...'\nZandberg couldn't register who was talking to him."

For some time, she urged Zandberg to remember the egalitarian ideals of the Razem party... and of course the moot traditions of the Vikings. After days of continuous lobbying, jarl finally gave in.\nZawisza hoped it was an apt time to avoid the catastrophe. \n- Hello, would you like to support me in the coming moot? - She handed a flier to one of the warriors. Among the men in wolf skin and linen tunics she stood out like a sore thumb in a dark blue jacket.\n- Umm, I'm sorry - the man struggled to comprehend the contents on the paper. That's what bothered Zawisza. What's so complicated about 35-hour work day and lower retirement age. - I'm not interested in politics.\nThe next person she asked, a berserker, was even worse.\n- Sorry, lady. I'll follow Sandbjerg, not some socialist.\nIt looked like the carmine on the banners had faded more than she initially expected.\n- Equal sharing of loot! Thank you for signing my petition. - Magdalena Biejat smiled with her pearly white teeth to every passing Viking - Greater role of Althing! Thank you.\nHer colleague opted to mold her appearance to the new reality. Instead of a more usual dark blue jacket and trousers, she wore a marine green dress stylized for the Middle Ages. She seemed to gather more attention, but who knows how many of her supporters will stand with her when pushes comes to shove.\n\n- The time of Althing has come! - The beginning of deliberation has been announced. By Kościelak no less.\nAnother disappointment. Zawisza had hoped that the speeches they gave would move the hearts and minds of the soldiers as well as the common sense of Zandberg, but he was nowhere to be seen. Instead, he appointed Kościelak as the master of ceremony, clearly to win his favor. Not to mention, the first speaker that will be called would be...\n- Magdalena Biejat. Please give us your speech.\n- Oh, brave warriors - Magda began her exposé - I'd like to thank you for your sacrifice during the recapture of Polish lands. Without you, we wouldn't be here. In the chaos of battle it is often hard to remember what we're fighting for. We fight for our country and the future of our children. That is why we have to think of our future. Of mighty investments built from the recent influx of money. Of women's rights, who just like you fight in the maternity wards. \n- A few more sentences, and she might actually convince a good chunk of them. - Zawisza thought to herself - Soon, I'll have my time to shine.\nThen a horse arrived on the beach carrying the Carmine Jarl himself.\n- Thor spoke to me.

Almost out of breath, Zygmunt tried to keep up with her snail's pace while desperately attempting to prevent the overstacked plates he topped up in the buffet from spilling their contents onto the pavement, turning the 200-meter walk to the beach into an excruciatingly difficult journey. Upon arrival, they placed their latest bounty onto the miniature table and laid down on their sunbeds, ready for another day of lounging and not much else. \n\n- Helenka, hasn't this place been kind of a bore lately? \n- Sure. And now that you mention it... It does feel a whole lot emptier than usual. Even the Müllers have left. I guess that's what happens when you skimp on the entertainment. They've been running the same few shows for the past two months. \n- Right. And the energy just isn't there. It's like the performers are being forced to do it. \n- You know what? At this rate, maybe we should start thinking about switching to a different resort. \n\nSailing through the turbulent waves, the boats approached the shore. The invasion fleet had arrived to claim this strip of the coastline. \n\n- I'll make the reservations once we get back to our room. There are a few places that I... hold on, you see that too, right? \n- Looks like some sort of a... well, I'll be damned, Helenka! That's a Viking longship. \n- Now that's new! Finally, they had the sense to change up their repertoire. \n- Meh, they still need to work on it. These outfits look terribly cheap. I could probably get something better from the nearest costume store. \n- Oh, don't be such a grump. They're doing their best. Besides, it's only a rehearsal. There weren't any Viking invasion reconstructions in today's event programme. \n\nUpon making contact with the land, the raiders disembarked, looking for plunder. Most headed immediately for the main facilities, their tunnel vision induced by the promise of loot and berserker fury. Firmly wielding his axe, one of the pillagers approached the elderly couple, standing over them menacingly. \n\n- In the name of Odin, hand over all your possessions, and you will be allowed to live. I don't want to bloody my axe today because of you two. \n- Sir, I must say, you are doing a wonderful job. Very convincing. If only I could offer one small suggestion, you might want to work on your accent a bit. \n- I'm giving you one final chance. Your money or your life. \n- Excuse me, my wife just gave you a compliment. Aren't you even going to thank her? \n- Wrong choice. \n\nWithout saying another word, the raider raised his weapon, his expression stone cold and unamused. He readied himself to strike at the defiant locals. \n- Helenka, I'm starting to think he really isn't joking..."

He was holding a Danish history book in his hand. - You volunteered to join the Alþýduher, so you won't end up as worthless thralls. But that means something! That means you need to put up some effort, or you'll be sent back to your hometown of Plundered-Upon-Nowhere in a body bag. We wouldn't want that, would we? So, let's practice good old defensive formations. Let's start with a shieldwall.\nThe commander showed the recruits the page from the book and waited for the results.\nAspiring Vikings formed a square and raised their round shields one next to each other. One such line of shields protected the front, and two others were meant to protect the flanks. Those in the middle raised their shields to protect them from above.\n- No! No, it's all wrong! Weren't you watching?- The instructor exploded - You'd barely understand how Nordic walking works, not to mention Nordic formations! Your shields are round, so they only connect at a single point, leaving massive gaps if you raise them next to another. They have to overlap, like the scales of a snake. And form just one wall, not four for Thor's sake.\nThe new squad soon began learning the ropes and formed something that resembled the shieldwall from the history book.\n- Alright, let's see if the formation is functional. Archers!\nA squad of marksmen readied their practice arrows and aimed towards the recruits. They fired, and thankfully for the infantrymen, none of the arrows penetrated the formation.\n- Ah, you're practicing shieldwall - the training was interrupted by one of the thenegs with his elite squad - Impressive, this will surely increase our defensive capabilities. If we fight our enemies in flat terrain. In hills and forests, however, your soldiers would be easily outflanked. Not to mention an encounter with more advanced foes.\nHe gestured his hand to signal his elite men-at-firearms to aim at the shieldwall.\n- I hope you understand my message - he continued. Still, as we continue to face enemies with clubs and slingshots, it will suffice. And I believe it'll be timelessly effective as a method of pacifying unarmed rioters. Nevertheless, I'd implore you to train the recruits in more dynamic tactics, so they could catch up to the shooters before they pierce them with bullets.\nThe instructor tried to cover his shame and anger by lacing into the newbies.\n-You heard him, men. Now, get ready for running exercise. Move!"

And why do we need a cog when we have perfectly fine clippers sitting about? - Biejat's voice fell on deaf ears, as Zawisza was too spaced out after the hours of debating to be of any use, and Zandberg...\n- We must show people our side, our Northern side. If we can't show it to people abroad, how can we bring it upon the nation? Ourselves?! No! - Zandberg slammed his mighty fist upon the oaken table, shaking the beer tankard.\n- We're gonna sail in cogs, we're going to put shields on port and starboard, we'll use sails and we WILL go a-VIKING!\n Oars, sails, shields, raids. That was Zandberg's vision for his domestic and global journeys. He may have been talked out of cogs eventually, but his mind was set and singular as shieldwall. Biejat could slightly relate, having re-watched Vikings with him. Zawisza was just sitting in her own world, the faint sounds coming from her indicating some sort of k-pop.\n- We are Wends, arms strong, raiding the weak with our hird. Raze the world and make it right. Where the Viking Age finally meets today. - Biejat could no longer get through to him. She knew the state all too well: Zandberg would retreat into his own vision of an idealized Viking future and wallow in it, nevermind how removed it was from the dreams he shared with Zawisza and Biejat. Down goes the tankard down his throat. They say people get particularly candid when drunk. Was this rambling lunatic being his true self right now? Was this what he was all about right now?\n\n And then, Zawisza stood up. She downed her own portion of mead and... drew a bone flute. The melody drew Zandberg's attention, a melancholy and slow lullaby-like flow sedating him. A few moments later, a skald entered.\n\nHwerʀ mag an kwirū habē sigljan,\n rōan þan sa ni ā āru?\n Hwerʀ mag wiþʀ wini skiljan \n anþi ni falljan tāru? \n\n Who can sail without a wind, row without oars. Who can part from a friend, and not shed tears. The bard spoke in Proto-Norse, even older than what Zandberg was promoting among Wends\n- Marcelina, that's a fine arrangement... I think... I think I hear what you say with this. We will split friends apart by making those expeditions. You don't want me to split them apart forever... lightly.\n - That's right. We are viking, arms strong, yes, but if we show our true natures to the weak before we're ready for a response... there will be nothing left of us. We must know who to trade with and who to raid, as we set sail. Look at our own domain. We still lack so many things...\n - Yes... - Zandberg concurred. - We need trade partners more than we need enemies. A time will come to show the world our true strength, but first we attain it. First we trade... and take only from those we can handle. But remember, Marcelina... not even songs will tell me that the pain of parting with a friend is greater than the glory of a triumph for skalds to remember."

An anonymous source provided a record of supposed collaborators associated with the fallen Eurokommissariat's regime, a struggling local newspaper published it unvetted in a ploy to boost its readership, and the population gave it its own interpretation: for them, it wasn't a public shaming; it was a hit list. \n\nSteinn and Gunnarr were halfway through their patrol when the news of the article made the rounds enough to finally reach them. A short call from dispatch dashed any hopes of a warm lunch down at the station. Instead, they were given new orders: to guard the mansion of one of the senior officials. Not out of any ideological sympathy, but simply because the bureaucrat had made enough panicked calls, it was deemed less arduous to send in some protection than listen to his constant wailing and complaints. \n\nBy the time the two officers arrived, a crowd of about fifteen protesters had gathered outside the building. Steinn and Gunnarr posted themselves right by the front gate, looking at the would-be intruders threateningly to make it clear not to even try getting in. This seemed to somewhat de-escalate the tension, turning the situation into a prolonged standstill. \n\n- Say what you will, that's quite a nice house he's got there. I'd be angry too if I were them. The city took a pretty heavy beating during the war. This is probably the only place where you can't see it. - Steinn turned to his partner to break the boredom. \n- Bureaucrats, huh? Always the same story everywhere. \n- Right. Really makes you wonder if we're helping the wrong side sometimes. \n- That's cause we are. What's it feel like risking your life protecting a diehard lib? \n- Not great. Not great at all. \n- So, how about we just let things... take their natural course? You know, actually, I think we didn't make it here on time. The property was already looted by the time we arrived. Such a shame. \n- Now that you mention it... I mean... he wouldn't want us to intervene anyway, would he? 'The state shouldn't have a monopoly on violence' and all that? \n- Now you're getting it. Had he wanted protection, he would've hired it on his own. It's so simple. Why didn't we consider it earlier? \n- Look at us, Steinn. Now we're finally being the real heroes. Fulfilling that man's wish, letting him live and die by his beliefs... It's almost beautiful. Brings a tear to my eye. \n\nWith an understanding gesture, the two partners each took a few steps to the side, leaving the entrance to the mansion wide open. Almost immediately, the angry masses began pouring onto the property. Steinn and Gunnarr drove away, satisfied, leaving the official to face the people's anger."

Then he tossed it away and handed the promised money to the man. - You can keep the axe. Use it to continue the harvest.

At the center of their scorn stood a gaunt figure clad in a tattered uniform - Aleksander Jabłonowski. Wojciech Olszański as was his true name. Lizard as he was called by his enemies and some \"friends\". Though wearied by years of war and wandering, he stood tall, clinging to what pride he still possessed. In one hand he held a nicked sword, in the other, a weathered leather shield. He said nothing, lost in the memory of battles - those fought before the cameras, and those waged in forests and scorched villages. Then a great roar thundered through the air, silencing the crowd. The silence was broken only by the slow, heavy beat of footsteps. Into the ring stepped Halfdan, taller than any man, clad in the hide of a bear, an axe in each hand. Beside him walked his retainer, who stopped between the two warriors, unrolled a scroll, and read aloud:\n\n- Wojciech Olszański, you have been challenged to holmgang by Halfdan Sandbjerg, for evil deeds done against the people of Wendland and the republic they held dear. You shall fight with chosen weapons. Broken shields may not be replaced. The duel ends in death, and the victor shall claim the spoils of the fallen.\n\nWith that, the warriors stepped closer, face to face, waiting for the Norse herald to leave the circle. The Dane struck first, swinging from above, but Wojciech caught the blow on his shield and countered with a slash from the right. Halfdan leapt aside and struck again, another downward blow, again blocked. The crowd howled anew, hurling curses at the one called out.\nWojciech thrust his blade forward, but Halfdan stepped back, caught the sword between the haft and blade of his axe, and wrenched it free, hurling it to the edge of the ring. So fierce was the move that Halfdan stumbled, unbalanced, leaving his guard open. Olszański seized the moment - he swung, and with all his fury, smashed the shield into the Dane's head. Halfdan staggered backward, dazed.\n\nSeeing his foe charge, Lizard surged forward - but the Dane, now enraged, charged as well, raining blows upon the already-weak shield. Wojciech heard the wood split - a terrible crack - and then he was on the ground, beneath the towering Viking. Halfdan cast aside his axes. He leapt onto his foe, striking his head again.\nAnd again. And again. And again.\nThen - silence.\n\nAnd Wojciech found himself upon a green meadow, beneath a sky untouched by smoke.\nAround him stood his comrades.\nAnd his wife.\nHis kin."

 jomsborg.32.desc: "The victorious Norseman sat solemnly in the dimly lit Viking's Throw pub in Szczecin, remembering their fallen brethren. Everyone waited and gazed upon the noble Halfdan Sandbjerg. In accordance with ancient traditions jarl was supposed to be the first to eat and drink on a feast. Adam Kościelak was appointed as his cupbearer. The Viking leader was still unsure of his destiny, but he was certain of one constant: he was a politician. Bestowing Kościelak with one honor after the other would secure his position in the party and army alike. He took a chalice from his hersir and emptied it in one sip. He looked seriously at his companions in the hall. Then he threw the chalice and roared with joy. Encouraged, the hall erupted with raucousness of its own.\nJarl's position was secure. His followers were ready to mimic him down to the last minute detail. It was inspiring. But also tiring. Refraining from monocracy in the party was not only an expression of dedication to egalitarianism, but a good way of avoiding too much work being done by one person. Especially if that person was Zandberg. To chase away the worries of the last months, jarl gestured for more mead. Still, not enough. Now, his mind was occupied by the memory of those morbid ghosts of the past.\n- Cup-bearer, another one. \nKościelak almost spilled the drink. Zandberg thought that he would've appointed someone more competent, if not for the need for the politicking. Why does it really have to be this way? Marcelina and Magda, sitting so close to him, elevated. They should be his friends. Instead, they play in factionalism.\n- Make that two chalices, actually, Adam.\n\n- And what does this... wirelessly connected dead guy know *hic* about vikinging that he wants my body. I already know everything by the saga. I'm a viKING! Ha! The best one since Harold Hard-drive *hic*. - Zandberg started arguing with himself. - Anyone doubts that?\nHe stood up and headed to the center of the hall.\n- You - he pointed at a random Viking - You know, who's the greatest Viking raider of all time?\n- Erm, Ragnar Lothbrok probably.\nAnother one doubted in his prowess. Ridden with grief, Zandberg punched the irresolute soldier.\n- And where is Ragnar Lothbrok now? I'm the greatest! Anyone doubts that? Fight me! I'll pass the jarldom to whoever defeats me!\nNot many accepted the challenge. Those who did fell under the powerful punches of the Mighty Dane. One was even tossed on the table.\n- Ok, that's enough! - Someone tried to subdue the jarl with words!\n- Who dares... oh, it's... You, Marcelina - Zandberg struggled to remain on his feet.\nSoon, she was joined by Magda.\n- Let's get out of here."

Outside she looked upon the shore and realized that the whole process took them so long, the sun has already risen. Biejat soon joined her colleague. \n- How's the agitation going? - Zawisza asked Biejat while still looking at the sunrise. \n- Great, actually - the shine of Biejat's enthusiasm put the shy morning sun to shame - The cancellation of first althing was beneficial to us. We got more time to prepare. Also because now all of Western Pomerania is under our control, we can reach to greater electoral base, so the althing election can be as democratic as possible. \nZawisza raised her eyebrow and turned her eyes on Biejat. She knew where this was going. \n- That was not part of the plan. The plan was to keep the turnout as low as possible, so we have to convince as few voters as possible to our policy. \n- Yes, that's what I did. - Biejat's voice remained calm - I convinced as many of the old guard as possible. I reached to the dedicated socialist, but that was not enough. The formers are worshipping Zandberg and the latter aren't as numerous. We need to bet on the quantity. \n- And who do you think, you're going to attract? - Zawisza's frustration grew - You know, you can't reason with the liberals. \nBiejat took a breath, looked at her colleague. \n- You know we want the same, Marcelina - the woman said with a delicate, placating smile - But we need allies and I can take care of that. If you think that the core supporters and party are so important, maybe you focus on Adam and his growing affection for Zandberg's excesses. \n- Oh, you think it's my fault that a grown man wants to play a Viking? \n- No, that's not what I meant. - Biejat remained defensive - It's just a suggestion. \n- Whatever - Zawisza was tired by the unslept night and all those games. - Do what you want. After all, you weren't put in jail by the burgois, but I wouldn't push my luck if I were you."

 jomsborg.34.desc: "The Great Northern Army gathered on the Silver Mountain in Jomsborg. Once again. The members of Zawisza-Biejat faction hoped that this one wouldn't be dissolved by Zandberg. Thankfully for them, this time jarl was present. He was sitting on a wooden throne and seemed to be in rather somber mood. \nMagdalena Biejat looked upon all those, who came to voice their opinions. The number of warriors grew exponentially. There was also a sizable amount of civilians, who realized that People's Republic of Jomsborg is the local hegemon and that it might be a good idea to have some say in what the new regime. In fact the sea of people willing to participate was so large that there weren't enough loudspeakers to ensure everybody could listen. Biejat readied herself to give a speech on the behalf her faction to all those people. \n- Welcome to the second Althing! - Adam Kościelak kept his office of a speaker - In the name of our jarl, I give voice to the member of the council - Magdalena Biejat. \n- Thank you - Biejat regretted that the best introduction was wasted for the mess that was the first Althing - We now stand firmly upon the lands secured to us by the valiant effort of our army. The military progress was achieved so quickly, that many among our own worry, what'll do, when there'll be nothing more to conquer. \n- Weaklings! - some shouted from the crowd - The fighting never ends! \n- There are question of returning to democracy, of the benefits for the civilians and soldiers with disabilities and of the fair economy \n- Cowards unwilling to fight don't deserve mercy! - The crowd grew more and more aggressive in their tone. \nAdam Kościelak looked at the angry gathering of bloodthirsty berserkers with understandable fear. Then he gave a Zandberg a quick glance looking for approval, but jarl's face hasn't flinch. \n- The ways of Odin served us well so far and are in tune with the left-wing values we all share. - Adam argued - Never after 1989 have there been a more successful way of wealth redistribution, even from the clergy. Enviromentalism has never been more popular among all social classes than it is today. \n- But you of all people should know about the distortions that take place. You adhere to much to the old ways. \n- No, Magda. It is you, who fails to realize your views are outdated. We can't keep the same program as we did before the Fall. The world's changed and we have to adapt to this brutal reality with enforcing our ideals with warrior's ethos. Who's with me? - the question was directed to the crowd. \nMost of the warriors cheered for Kościelak. \n- And who still believes that another politics is possible? - Biejat decided to count the axes loyal to her. \nHer supporters were mostly civilians. All in all there was a 50/50 split. \nThen Zandberg raised his hand and left the field."

Some younger workers at the town hall were struggling to adapt, but Kazimiera Jędrzejak has already survived one seemingly diametrical regime change; she could do that again. Then suddenly, the silence of the office was broken by the loud sounds of someone choking on a herring. Apparently, someone was having a lively discussion in Danish just outside Kazimiera’s room. The two perpetrators soon came in; The armor they wore indicated that they served in the jarl's army. \n- Good morning – said one of them in clear Polish - me and my husband got married back in Denmark, when Alþýduher was still stationed on Bornholm. We would like a transcription of our marriage act to make it legal here in Poland.\n- I’m afraid the current law makes it impossible – Kazimiera replied monotonally– If you’re interested in the typical benefits of marriage you can petition for joint loot ownership in room 4, in room 16 you can regulate the question of inheritance of drakkars and in room 6 you can authorize anyone to receive letters addressed to you or be informed your health state after a battle. Please note that some services require additional payment. \n- You don’t seem to understand. – The petitioner remained unyielding – My husband has a daughter from a previous marriage. If he passes away during the war, the girl I raise with him will have no one here to take care of her.\n- I understand completely – the bureaucrat didn’t take too kindly to someone trying to falsely suggest her incompetence. – The girl will receive a PESEL number, an act of birth, and a passport, in which we can only name a single father and a single mother. If anything happens to her father, she will be sent back to her family in Denmark or placed in an orphanage. \n- Bullshit! – The man has had enough. His husband tried to calm him, but it was futile – We follow gods of incest, rape, and gender-changing, but where two loving people can’t get a paper legalizing marriage that has already been contracted? \n- Yes, you’re making perfect sense, sir. - The bureaucrat looked from behind her glasses. The men looked at each other, a little disoriented.\n- In case of your sudden deification, you and your partner are welcome to renew the petition to receive a marriage transcription.

He channeled his fury on the dummies on the training field. Now that he had cooled down, he reconsidered that such a meeting would be very in line with the idea of collective leadership. In his wisdom, he decided to head to the conference room. \nIn it, he found all of the council. All of them looked at him with compassion. \n- We’re worried about you, Adrian – Biejat, as always began as the diplomat. \n- In the past… years, you haven’t been yourself – Zawisza stuck to facts as always. \n- Your… attitude helped us in the past, but sometimes you seem to lose yourself – Kościelak, still undecided. \n- That’s why we still support you, but I think you should get some professional help. – Grucela finished with a straight-to-the-point conclusion. \n- I understand you – Zandberg decided to convince his troubled companions – At first I was scared too, but in time I began to accept that I have been blessed with a gift. I’m still not sure how to use it, but it’s something that will help us unite Poland and shape it in a way we have always dreamed of. You seemed to understand that, Adam. Kościelak moved his head down in shame and tried to explain himself. \n- It served us well when we were the underdogs in the north. But you know that the Vikings changed their way when they ventured beyond Scandinavia. \n- We’re by no means specialists – Grucela continued the offensive – but from what it looks like, you seem to be suffering from some sort of mental illness. \n- I hear you – Zandberg replied – I thought the same thing, but you see the whole point of mental illnesses is that you suffer because of them. And since I accepted that I can speak with the souls of the Vikings, I don’t suffer. \nZawisza rolled her eyes. I feel great, actually. - Zandberg continued - I see all those possibilities and realize that I am the only one who can guide humanity in this new age. The ghosts aren’t a problem if I keep shedding the blood of the enemies. But that’s because we’re in a war. - But, what if the war ends – Kościelak chimed in. - I don’t think it ever will. Enemies hide in the shadows. Always. - Ok – war leader took a moment to think – What are your conditions… What if the ghosts start to demand more? We can’t rule out mental illness based solely on our whim. That’s what has always separated us from Mentzenites and other such types. That really stung Zandberg. - Ok, if I start feeling bad, I’ll get some help. - We kinda looked for an offer already – Grucela handed him a card."

His eyes were still not used to the brightness, but he could already hear that familiar rattle, except now, there were four more unfortunates bound along with him. After climbing up the three steps onto the main platform, he could finally make out what had previously been an unbearable, deafening buzz. Hundreds of angry voices hollering, throwing insults at the condemned. At that point, he understood his fate. \n\n- Quiet! Behave yourselves, peasants! Do you not know who stands before you? - At the warrior's command, the crowd went silent, leaving only mocking expressions. At last, Karol could finally hear his own thoughts. \n\n- That's better. We wouldn't want to give the wrong impression now, would we? Sigmundr, release our finalists from their chains! \n\nWith his hands free, the tycoon glanced around the arena, looking for a potential escape route. The two side exits were carefully guarded by armed axemen while the main one was blocked by an even more bloodthirsty crowd. There was no getting out of there. \n\n- Take a good look, people. This is the face of capital. These are your betters: Those who have achieved riches beyond your wildest dreams. But only one can be this year's winner. Please give a round of applause to...

The warrior playing the role of the host held him by the shoulders, bringing a microphone up to his face as soon as he regained a stable footing. \n\n- So, Karol... That was quite an impressive performance. You've been on our radar for a while now, but your recent efforts... inspiring, really. \n- Wait... what is this all even about? What performance? \n- You did it. You won capitalism. That's what you've always wanted, right? Please accept this humble gift on behalf of us all. We know it's nothing when compared to your fortune, but let this horn of plenty symbolize your commitment to wealth. \n- I uhh... thank you, I'm honored. \n- Mhm. Tie this band over your eyes. We have one more secret reward for you; this one far more befitting someone of your status. \n\nKarol obeyed, still slightly suspicious. The Viking pushed him down, and he could feel his neck pressed against a hard piece of wood. He panicked, flailing desperately, but he was unable to force himself out of the position.

 jomsborg.47.desc: "‘Ever before the formation of the state centered in Gniezno, the lands upon Vistula were inhabited by the Vandals that defined Wendland Germanic heritage for centuries to come.’ \nDr. Jan Dokalfar was struggling with writing a schoolbook in accordance with the new curriculum, which stated that: 'All Wendish children shall know in their hearts and minds that the blood of the Scandinavians fills their veins.' He took a deep breath and got to work. \n‘Everyone knows of the Scandinavian heritage of the first historical ruler of our country - Dago, who, for his Slavic subjects, adopted the name Mieszko. \nThe genetic studies confirm this hypothesis. Mieszko’s predecessors were travellers from Scotland, a target of Viking raids and colonization. During his rule, the influx of Nordic settlers came to the Vistula to serve the Pjastr dynasty. Their descendants were known as Wends, and they lived alongside their Slavic neighbors, known as the Poles. From now on, the names Poland and Wendland were used interchangeably among its Germanic neighbours. While the country after the Great Migration was predominantly Slavic, its Nordic elites shaped the culture of the kingdom. \n- I’ll need more mead for this... - Jan took a quick break and returned to writing. \n‘The unified Wendish monarchy lasted with some interruptions until 1138 r., when duke Burisleif Skævmundede ultimately divided the country and his successors lost the royal title. This vacuum was filled by Knud IV of Denmark, who used the cultural similarities of Danish and Wendish cultures and usurped the title of the king of the Wends in 1185. The title was recognized by the Pope, and so from now on the Pjastr rulers, such as Przemysł II and Władysław the Elbow-High, had to satisfy themselves only with the title of the kings of Poland.” \nAnother sip. \n‘Despite the loss of the title, the ties between Poland or Wendland and Scandinavia were well-known around Europe. It’s no coincidence that William Shakespeare, in ‘Hamlet’ – a play about a Danish prince mentions in the same breath Norway, England, and Poland, proving the latter shared just as much history with Denmark as the former. The character of Polonius, the royal advisor, also exemplifies the close connection between the two nations. \nAlthough in the modern era the Polish elites distanced themselves from their Wendish past, they remembered it well. That is why in 1587, Swedish prince Sigismund Vasa prevailed in the struggle for the crown against the Austrian candidate and established the longest-lasting elective dynasty.’ \nDoctor of history looked at his diploma on the wall, disgusted with himself. In the new schoolbook, he couldn’t write the most obvious resemblance between Wendland and Denmark."

Michniewicz refused the offer. He didn’t want to go against the official Church hierarchy even under special circumstances. That and he still felt guilty because he had been broken and had left the faithful to the wrath of Northmen. \n- I’m not ready. Maybe later. – He said after each time Mazurkiewicz brought up the matter. – My mind needs to be clear. \nThat was easier said than done. Each night, he had woken up, reminding himself of the sack of Kamień Pomorski. He spent a lot of time looking at the window in case a Viking patrol was heading towards the church, and never went too far from any hiding spots, just in case. He even asked Father Sławomir if he had any plan if the invader decided to plunder his parish this time. \n- Look – Michniewicz had answered him then – I appreciate your concern and understand you’ve been through so much pain. But my humble church is not of the same rank as the Cathedral of St. John. It’s neither as rich in artifacts nor as important as a symbol. Besides, now the Vikings need to rule the land they conquer. They can’t keep plundering it. Father Sławomir seemed to be right. Paweł grew to appreciate his new home. He dared to venture outside the parish and help with the housework and found some comfort in the lives of the saints, who faced persecution. He liked reading them at the nearby lakes. \nHe later regretted letting his guard down. \nWhen he returned from one such trip to Lake Bierzwnik, he noticed a crowd with spears and torches waiting in front of the parish. He froze for a good moment, but then clenched his fist, made a sign of a cross, and approached the crowd. \nThe Vikings were stealing all that glittered from the Church, as well as the items local archaeologists have brought to exhibit. What they took, they threw to the gathered civilians. Then they dragged Father Sławomir out of the church. Maybe so he can serve as a thrall. Maybe to kill. Michniewicz decided to act this time. \n- Hey! – he shouted at the top of his lungs, and all of the sacrilegious plunderers looked at him – Leave him alone! \nThe captured priest took his chance and headbutted the Viking holding him in the nose. Mazurkiewicz began running, and another raider rushed to chase him \n- Leave him be! – their leader ordered – Here we’ve got a hardy specimen with much more potential.\nPaweł became slave once more..."

After the expulsion of the region’s former landowners, their fields have mostly been left deserted. The previous season has already seen severe harvest failures due to uncultivation. The chiefdom was dying, and to prevent its demise, it needed more farmers; more former Vikings ready to leave their lives of raiding and pillaging behind and settle down. \n\n- Give me the good news, Olav. Any claimants yet? \n- Not... necessarily, hersir. But we’ll continue searching. Haakon still has some contacts among the Vikings. If you increase the settlers’ bounty, we could try to plead our case with them. \n- Olav, it’s been two months. You cannot tell me that not a single person applied. We are literally giving them free land. What more could they want? \n- Well... technically, there have been a few candidates, but they’ve been flagged by our vetting system and auto-rejected. \n- Okay, fine, just fetch me their applications. I do not trust Einarr’s judgement. \n- Hersir, you specifically appointed him as the vetting system. Wouldn’t that defeat the whole purpose? \n- Listen, while he was drunk on mead and mindlessly pressing the red stamp, we could’ve given away most of our available farmland, so you better hope we can still reach out to some of these people. \n\nReaching Einarr’s office took no longer than three minutes. Olav grabbed the stack of rejected applications and quickly ran back to his chieftain. \n\n- Alright, here they are. Would you like me to exclude the incomplete and joke applications? \n- I assumed you’ve already done so. This is what, like ten forms \n- Twelve, exactly. But we’ll have to get rid of this one... That one is just downright incomprehensible... oh, and looks like this candidate just ripped his paper in half... Okay, we’re down to... 3 sincere applicants. Great. \n- And you didn’t follow up with them, because...? \n- Vagn Egillsson - lost his leg during a raid on Mjollna. Subsequently deemed incapable of any manual labor. Accepting him would likely mean paying out his pension for little to no benefit. Knutr of Svidvik - documented history of filing claims in nearly every chiefdom. Since last year, the largest landowner this side of the Svinna. Rarely visits his possessions, leaving the work to laborers captured during raids. Not really an asset to the community. And finally, Radulfr the Berserker. You’ve heard of Radulfr, haven’t you, hersir? \n- Mhm. Great soldier, genuinely awful guy. Kicked out of Arnskrona for beheading the local Jarl over a land dispute. However, we cannot afford another failed harvest. Ehh, contact the last two. Tell them they can come and pick out whatever land they want."

 jomsborg.61.t: "A Valkyrie's Burden"
 jomsborg.61.desc: "Ulfr swung his axe blindly as he slowly retreated through the forest clearing. He was hurt to the point where even the adrenaline did little to cover the pain. The warrior stumbled; his energy had long since worn off, but he pushed through it, knowing he was surrounded. Eventually, always making sure he had only one escape route, the pack of assailants backed him into a cordoned-off corner. The exhausted berserker gestured towards them threateningly. \n\n- Jorunnr, you take this one. \n- Again? Why does it always have to be me, Eydis? \n- Because that's my order. Now get in there before he runs off again. - She said angrily through her teeth. \n\nPushing through the initial hesitation, the Valkyrie extended her hand, slowly approaching Ulfr in small steps, trying to make herself seem as non-threatening as possible. Whenever the panicked warrior made any sudden movement, she flinched, ready to duck away from the incoming strike. Eventually, she got as close as she safely could, speaking to the warrior softly. \n\n- Hey there, big guy. You look pretty roughed up. That's quite a serious wound you've got there. Don't worry. Come with us and we'll get that patched up right away. \n- Get away from me, you evil temptress! - He waved his weapon in the air uncoordinatedly, causing Jorunnr to momentarily freeze in fear before she regained her composure. \n- Seriously, put that away before anyone else gets hurt. The battle is over. - Irritation broke through the performatively caring tone. \n- No! I know what you're planning. I won't let you! You'll never take me! \n- Look, you're safe now. You've done your job. We won. There's no point in bleeding out in some random forest. \n- Leave! Let me go to Valhalla! I will feast with the Gods! I will fight... - There was a quiver in his voice. He was afraid. The Valkyrie felt a renewed sense of compassion. \n- Shh, you know, there'll be many more battles ahead. I'm sure you'll find the perfect one for yourself to die in. It doesn't have to be today. \n- You... promise? - He was practically in tears. \n- I promise. And when you enter the gates of Valhalla and stand before Odin, would you not wish to tell him you've slain not ten, but a hundred óvinir? Just think about what special place he'd have prepared for you then. \n- I... would like that, yes... \n- Exactly. So keep working on that number. And maybe... try to approach us on your own next time? I think you almost accidentally grazed me. - She clutched a minor wound on her forearm, trying to cover it from the Viking's view."

 jomsborg.62.t: "Hårdråde"
 jomsborg.62.desc: "Hardwood. Hard, coarse table. And hard men, leaders of fearsome Jomsborgians who dedicated their lives to raids a-viking. Some were bearded fully, hair growing out, others had their manes growing still. Many had glaze, bright eyes, from their berserker time, from henbane and fly agaric use. \nBut from Zawisza's point of view, the men were mostly hard to deal with.\n- Is it true about Snorri and Swen? - one young jarl asked.\n- Snorri was hit and wiped out. This might be the end of the raids near the Free City, he always went closer than most there. Swen captured by that monastery honeypot that turned out to be swarming with soldiers, his berserkers wiped out, it's a catastrophe. - another younger man answered, having all the clarity of a military intel officer and none of the personality of a Jomsborg leader.\n- Perhaps we should refocus our raids elseplace. Lull them into a false sense of safety - he continued.\nThen Zawisza took the man's mead and split it in the middle of the table, earning hard looks from all other leaders, as well as their attention.\n- There's your sense of safety. You vikings saw to that when they were livestreaming their raids. The whole voivodeships are up in arms and are seething to take revenge.Now they pray, mourn their families and fortify. Tomorrow? They unite through purpose. And then we'll have them at our gates and you berserkers will get to live out your Varangian Guard act... but make no mistake, our walls are not that of Miklagard. You'll have an easier time drinking that mead off the table, than raiding without any strategy or organisation.\n\n- The first order of business is ransoming Swen. - the young jarl retorted.\n- You mean breaking him out?! - a grizzled berserker of a jarl answered.\n- But first, we must rally...\n - and soon enough the commotion grew beyond telling the voices apart, or Zawisza's control. She was facing. Recounting mantras about men being the problem. She was egging Zandberg to organize this sorry band of glorified bandits into a real military, but she was asking herself now if they don't need a whole new leadership first...\nWHAM! - The table and everything on it shook drastically. A man of short hair and mighty beard rose, his fur shoulderwear doubling his presence. His eyes were that of what they loved the most: the icy gaze of a harsh ruler.\n- Swen... is held by an entire battalion of men. My scouts have the location and basic assessment. Any one of you is welcome to step into the henbane mist and die trying to break him out. Or, we get him out. We get organized, we embrace the chain of command, we fight as an army, a force that can not only raid but conquer. This country any other we please! Whom of you sees Cnut the Great, Harald Hardrade, as no true northmen? These men conquered nations, or died trying like real warriors. They are our way forward...\n- Christians, the lot of them. I knew your heart wasn't of the North - the old berserker scoffed, and immediately his beard was seized by Zandberg and pulled close to his face\n You can leave us right now, if you're going to call Hardrade Christian again. He was partial to Jesus, yes, but he always syncretized him alongside the Old Gods.\nHe let go of him and returned to his seat\n- They were at the dusk of the Viking age because the Viking Age could no longer cope with pressure of increasingly organised Europe. But make no mistake... their legacy lives on in them. And it will be in us. Because we won't be scattered like roaming bandits, we will prevail. Now let me show you, how we will prevail\n\nZawisza sighed in relief. Just when she lost hope, it turned out one man kept his head."

 unification.76.desc: "Years ago, back when Eurokommissariats were first created, leftist agitators and politicians were deemed a thorn in Tusk's side. Among their  leaders was Adrian Zandberg, who soon went missing under suspicious circumstances. Nobody knew what happened to him afterward, yet eventually, he returned to  unleash hell upon us all. His great army of socialists and Vikings invaded the western shore, smashing all liberal and fascist resistance, creating a state  combining Scandinavian social democracy and Nordic paganism. Many cities belonging to the neighboring cliques were soon set ablaze, bearing witness to a new way to  redistribute wealth - bloody coastal raids. While definitely a brutal method, due to this stolen cash, the Folkerepublikken's citizens maintain that this ecological  welfare state truly enhanced their living standard compared to the times of Westpolen. Now both capitalists and Christians are hunted down, their bodies turned into  blood eagles, serving as grim examples of the madness engulfing Poland."

 POLITICS_HALFDAN_SANDBJERG_DESC: "There was a man who dreamt of a better Poland. Of social justice and equality. Of a peaceful struggle for rights and against  exploitation. This man navigated carefully in the sea of politics, trying to balance the needs of people and requirements of liberal democracy. All these efforts  proved to be in vain. \n\nThe EU intervention, seeming auspicious at first, brought nothing but further misery to Poland. The gates to a just, equitable European  society were just as before, closed shut. Adrian Zandberg began to criticize the occupational government, and the angry masses heeded his words too eagerly. Tusk  ordered his imprisonment and handed him over to some of the most despicable thugs he could foster. Zandberg never disclosed the details, but he escaped the prison  as a different man. \n\nHe got to the shores of Bornholm and gazed upon the sea. He ran from beyond the sea, yes, but his origins were here, in the North. His blood  boiled, his soul yearned for revenge. What good was there in the constant squabbling and striving to bring forward a civil, non-violent popular change? He was the  survivor, the warrior, the Northman - a Viking. If Poland has failed to become a fair, humane country, that's too bad for Poland. \n\nSandbjerg wants to start with  an axe and end with a helping hand. The redistribution of wealth can be done by force alone, and Sandbjerg draws it from many sources - starting from deranged  neopagans, through disillusioned revolutionaries, ending on radicalized social democrats; whoever willing to fight will get their share. There is no simple answer  to whether this is an unorthodox interpretation of socialism or simple warlordism, although time will bring an answer to that query. \n\nFor now, §0the storm is coming from the north, and the Poles are going to wither.§!"
