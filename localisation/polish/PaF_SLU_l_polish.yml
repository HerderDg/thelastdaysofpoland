 SLU_country_of_the_peoples_of_the_streets: "Country of the Peoples of the Streets"
 SLU_country_of_the_peoples_of_the_streets_desc: "What may seem as an unorganized mob of hooligans to an outsider, the Street People are a tightly knit group who wholeheartedly respect and live by the Street Peoples Cred, rules of which have been laid down by the one and only Rychu "Peja". The rap musician turned warlord now leads the faithful crowds of blue-white clad followers aiming to bring an end to the corrupt system, and to truly establish the Street Peoples Cred over Poznań."
 SLU_looming_chaos: "Looming Chaos"
 SLU_looming_chaos_desc: "The well hated officers of Poznań Police have been dealt with one way or the other, however the subsequent vacuum has caused general disorder to fester within the districts. Rival gangs or even freelance criminals plunder our city without remorse, disrespecting the Street Peoples Cred."
 SLU_generations_war: "Generations War"
 SLU_generations_war_desc: "A schism has formed recently within the ranks of the Street People. While most of the OG members follow the lead and music of the 90's - by old school rappers like Peja himself, the younger generation gravitates more towards modern rap. This lack of unity is problematic to say the least, as it causes frequent infighting within our troop."

unification.61.t: "[GetNewspaper]Slums of Poznań unify Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.61.desc: "After the chaos following the collapse of Eurokommissariat Westpolen, all-out chaos and anarchy followed, with chaos and only chaos eventually ending up banished by a state that baffles most educated pundits. The territory of the former Voivodeship has come under “control” of the Poznań Slums, an anarchist commune “led” by Ryszard “Peja” Andrzejewski, an accomplished rapper with next to no leadership experience. Inspired by their spokesperson's artistry, the Slums can be best described as a society characterized by “tenement ideology,” as in “Living your own life and being left the hell alone.” Though insistent on being distinct from the usual political divide of left and right, the Slums are already being hailed by some on the European far-left as the advent of anarchism, if not anarcho-communism, as well as an example for the rest of the country, with far more humanitarian policies compared to the average Polish warlord statelet."

super.61.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.61.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.61.a: "United at last."
