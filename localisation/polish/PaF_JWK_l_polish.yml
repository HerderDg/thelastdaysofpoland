unification.20.t: "[GetNewspaper]JWK Lubliniec jednoczy Zagłębie i Jurę"
unification.20.desc: "Fresh news from Zagłębie and Jura: Despite being cut off from all other friendly formations, the Military Commando Unit based in the town of Lubliniec has managed to dominate the entire region. Using the combined military might of the Commandos and the large, albeit inexperienced Territorial Defense Forces, they managed to forcefully restore order under a military administration. Though relations between the two groups have been significantly strained, with commandos and territorials often disregarding orders given out by the other branch and semi-regular clashes disturbing the peace in the bases, the General Staff managed to bring the units to heel and force them to tolerate one another enough to fight side by side. Time will tell if this army with a state has any chance at survival considering the deepening conflict among its ranks, but however fractured it may be, JWK's sheer firepower cannot be underestimated."

super.20.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.20.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
