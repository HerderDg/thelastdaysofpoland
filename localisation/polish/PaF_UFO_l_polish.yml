unification.174.t: "[GetNewspaper]Area 52 Ufologists unify Kuyavia!"
unification.174.desc: "The citizens of Kuyavia watch on in shock as against all odds, their region has been seized by a secretive organization dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life. Small in number and seen as little more than a disjointed grouping of conspiracy theorists desperately clinging to a long-forgotten alleged sighting, the unexplainable success of Zagórski's ufologists has led some to claim that 'Nautilus' may truly be in possession of thus-unknown alien technology. Leaked documents depicting incomprehensible schematics of interplanetary vehicles and futuristic weaponry indicate a concentrated reverse-engineering effort, while hundreds of antennas aimed at the universe's infinite vastness work ceaselessly to establish first contact. Despite all these signs, skeptics dismiss the statelet as a product of mass hysteria, and its search as nothing but a futile spur of collective madness, but given the recent flair-up of reported alien activity in Kuyavia, there might be more to this story than science can possibly explain."
unification.174.a: "I want to believe."

UFO_kosmity: "Sekrety kosmosu"
UFO_kosmity_desc: "The fact that we're not alone in the universe does not need to be reaffirmed. It's a fact. It's still up for debate just how often whatever is out there comes to visit, but what we do know is: For one reason or another, the extraterrestrials decided to mark their presence on a random field in Wylatowo. To this day, we have not deciphered the wisdom they encoded into these emblems. Yet, eventually, we will uncover their secrets. Do they come in peace? What knowledge do they bring? Most importantly: will they ever return? It's been a quarter of a century since their last message. Still, we continue to believe..."

UFO_szury: "Duchowe zestrojenie"
UFO_szury_desc: "For too long, the scientific establishment tried to maintain a monopoly on truth. Under the sorry excuse of 'empiricism,' they have suppressed all alternative viewpoints, trying to purge the world of all that is spiritual or metaphysical. But no matter their efforts to extinguish that spark, the people will always feel that connection to something greater than themselves. We are the land of a thousand theories, each one equally valid - the greatest open debate space for everything the deep state tried to hide. We draw upon forces beyond comprehension. Our knowledge and potential have been unchained."
