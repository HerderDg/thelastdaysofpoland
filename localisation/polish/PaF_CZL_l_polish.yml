unification.90.t: "[GetNewspaper]Przewidokracja jednoczy Pomorze Gdańskie!"
unification.90.desc: "Shock. Anger. Confusion. Those are the words the residents of Pomerelia most frequently uttered when asked about their feelings towards their new regime. The events of the past months have left everybody in the region stunned, unable to make sense of the reality they found themselves in. That is - everybody except Krzysztof Jackowski, who claims to have predicted his own rise to power many years in advance. From the sleepy towns of Człuchów and Chojnice, warriors marched out, quickly reaching the sea, as one by one, warlords crumbled before them. And with the capture of Gdańsk, the prophecy is finally complete. Every enemy crushed and each uprising quelled have only added to the mystique of the region's new leader, as surely only someone with truly supernatural abilities would be able to keep winning despite seemingly insurmountable odds. Only one man knows what will happen next. And his lips remain sealed for now."
unification.90.a: "Gdy jesteś dziesięć kroków przed wszystkimi, zwycięstwo jest pewne."

super.90.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.90.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.90.a: "United at last."
