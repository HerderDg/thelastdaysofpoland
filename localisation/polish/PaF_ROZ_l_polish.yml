ROZ_jaskowiak_siege: "Jaśkowiakowe oblężenie"
ROZ_jaskowiak_siege_desc: "The euphoria following the successful assault on the Poznań Citadel didn't last long, as the local authorities mustered a severe response. Territories under control of the Street Peoples have fallen under siege from all sides, as Poznań's government attempts to starve the rebelious populace into submission. Despite their efforts however, the morale is still high, and people still trust in the Cred."
ROZ_united_and_divided: "Zjednoczeni i podzieleni"
ROZ_united_and_divided_desc: "The gang's numbers have never been higher, since left leaning groups have joined up with Rozbrat under the banner of Street Peoples Cred, however despite believing in the same goals, subgroups within the ranks continue to clash, impacting the cohesion and morale of the entire troop."
ROZ_island_of_freedom: "Wyspa wolności"
ROZ_island_of_freedom_desc: "Despite all adversities, Street Peoples Cred has rooted itself within the minds and hearts of people of Poznań. In the authoritarian shark infested sea of chaos that Poland has become, territories united by Rozbrat stand as an island of true, unopposed anarchist freedom and self governance."

super.195.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.195.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.195.a: "United at last."

unification.195.t: "[GetNewspaper]Rozbrat Unites Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.195.desc: "What was once a major metropolis of pre-war Western Poland, was reduced to district-sized warlord states fighting for domination. Having emerged victorious in the bloody power struggle in the city of Poznań, gangs of Rozbrat have taken control of entirety of the city, as well as large swathes of land across Greater Poland. Citizens of the metropolis can finally breathe easy as, with the pre-war president overthrown and corporative machinations of Żabka stopped, Poznań has now become a haven of anarchistic freedom. Now the gangs began to consolidate their forces in attempt to defend against and hopefully bring down despotic warlords outside of Greater Poland, who took great offence in the ideas of Poznań's Liberty taking root. It remains to be seen if the society of anarchist communities will be able to resist the pressure of authoritarian neighbours."
unification.195.a: "Rozbrat's not for sale."
