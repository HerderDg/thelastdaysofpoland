unification.81.desc: "Thrice defeated, humiliated, and nearly relieved of his duties for his failures during the Invasion, the general of the Northern Command refuses to yield. Despite a series of early setbacks, the battered remnant army in Grudziądz successfully beat back defeatist spirits, re-establishing itself as a capable fighting force and rolling across Kuyavian-Pomerania in a synchronized, combined arms operation reminiscent of Janusz Adamczak's finest days as a commanding officer. Due to the continued presence of hostile forces on Polish soil, the region has been temporarily reorganized under a military administration set to provide the means through which the resurgent army could launch further campaigns to restore order to the country. Citing internal stability, the state presently prohibits the expression of 'potentially dangerous' pro-democratic dissent, vowing to hold elections only once 'the safety of Poland has been guaranteed.' Yet are those declarations a real promise or merely the stalling words of a future junta?"
unification.81.a: "Seems we're on for another campaign season."
