unification.26.t: "[GetNewspaper]Duchy of Beuthen unifies Silesian Metropolis!"
unification.26.desc: "The past never lets go, always leaving a faint glimmer in the distance, waiting to remind the world of its existence. In Silesia, the winds of nostalgia blow toward the region's rich German history, igniting a warm sentiment for the order and stability once brought by its protective Western overlords. This sympathy for the far more certain past, resonating among its inhabitants, has allowed Count von Schaffgotsch, a descendant of the noblemen that governed the area centuries ago, adored by his subordinates - Polish, Silesian, and German alike, to seize ownership of the Silesian Metropolis. As the long-forgotten inheritors of the old landowners' and entrepreneurs' estates return to their rightful lands, their current Polish owners face the risk of once again playing the role of colonial slaves exploited by German capital. Despite this, the Count has so far retained his popularity among the locals, enjoying far greater support than any of their compatriots had before."
