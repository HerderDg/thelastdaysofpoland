unification.39.t: "[GetNewspaper]Bracia Golec jednoczą Beskidy!"
unification.39.desc: "A motorcade of technicals filled to the brim with armed bandits and brass bands has been spotted rolling from Żywiec to Bielsko-Biała among the deafening noise of gunshots and folk music. It was led by „Bernadetka” - a giant monster truck manned by the Golec brothers - the leaders of a notorious bandit group that has apparently placed the entirety of Podhale under their heels. Having united the Górals through ruthless raids and robberies, it is unclear whether the band will be able to sustain its further existence and expansion in the same manner. The leadership seems conflicted on the subject, and external observers have observed divergent rhetoric from the brothers, with one postulating that the band should improve their armed prowess and focus on control through sheer might, while the other has been seen discussing the possibility of large-scale reforms in the spirit of extreme liberalism and freemarketism. For now, however, analysts remain preoccupied with discerning one Golec from another."
