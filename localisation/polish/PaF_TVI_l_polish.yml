unification.175.t: "[GetNewspaper]Tan-Viet unifies Pomerelia!"
unification.175.desc: "What began as a logistics foothold in Gdańsk has turned into a bold experiment in corporate statecraft. Tan-Viet, one of Central Europe's most prominent oriental food distributors, has unified Pomerelia under its brand - boardroom first, boots second. With surprising speed, the company established a functioning civil structure: supply chains became lifelines, warehouses became ministries, and former distribution centers now fly both Polish and Vietnamese flags. Efforts are underway to cultivate rice near the Vistula - an ambitious, symbolic attempt to 'bring the Mekong to the Baltic.' Tan-Viet spokespeople promise 'diaspora integration' and 'reconnection,' offering not just stability but belonging for thousands of Vietnamese Poles long treated as outsiders. While critics whisper about corporate colonialism, others see efficiency, peace, and stocked shelves. For now, Tan-Viet offers something rare in post-Fall Poland: order. Whether that order is sustainable - or simply the first course in a larger appetite for power - remains to be seen."
unification.175.a: "Is it still Pomerelia? Or perhaps Pho-merelia?"


super.175.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.175.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.175.a: "United at last."
