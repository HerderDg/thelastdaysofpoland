unification.203.t: "[GetNewspaper]Zawiercie unites Zagłębie and Jura!"
unification.203.desc: "Once part of the beating heart of Polish industry, western Lesser Poland has fallen into countless warring state-like entities. Recently however, a stabilising force has emerged upon the Kraków-Częstochowa Highlands. The government of Zawiercie has put aside their differences and attained a powerful position over their neighbouring territories. The land between Częstochowa and the medieval capital of Kraków hold the cradle of The Bulwark of Jura, as it came about to be known across the region. Nation state founded in Zawiercie is now a strong candidate to unite the entire Lesser Poland voivodeship. It remains to be seen if an economy fueled by rich mineral deposits and various heavy industry plants left over from before the fall, will allow the Bulwark of Jura to maintain it's regional supremacy."
unification.203.a: "Jurassic Bulwark stands tall."
