unification.139.t: "[GetNewspaper]Tarnów Agrarians unify Lesser Poland"
unification.139.desc: "Following a string of intense conflicts, a single warlord has come out on top in what once used to be the Lesser Polish Voivodeship, namely Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz and his Tarnów-based peasant republic. Though the government's name may sound extreme to some, in truth, the state exists as a successor to one of the most mainstream, moderate and generally respected parties on the Pre-Fall political scene. Despite fading into relative obscurity in previous years, the legacy of PSL seems to not just continue, but rather shine brighter than it ever has. The triumphant Kosiniak-Kamysz promises that his party shall do all it can to faithfully represent the rural folk, especially now that they finally have the authority to enforce their long-suppressed policies, but that in order to deliver upon these words, he must first exert authority over the southern highlanders and the hostile government of neighboring Jura."
unification.139.a: "Now is the time for a REAL agrarian revolution!"

super.139.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.139.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.139.a: "United at last."
