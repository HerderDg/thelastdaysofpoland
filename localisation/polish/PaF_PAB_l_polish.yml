unification.173.t: "[GetNewspaper]1st People's Armoured Brigade unifies Radomskie!"
unification.173.desc: "According to information flowing in from Radomskie, on the site of a historic victory of the Polish armored corps, a new chapter of the people's struggle has recently been written. Though small in number and forced to ride into battle on a pitiful mixture of barely serviceable equipment and pilfered museum pieces, the 1st Armoured Brigade successfully captured the people's hearts and rekindled the merry, adventurous spirit of the tankmen. Hailed in the region as liberators, Piechociński's men can count on a significant credit of trust from the local population, which has thus far actively contributed to their campaigns. Though they're already preparing to launch their next operation, the tankists face a challenge far more pressing for those they claim to defend. Over the course of the fighting, the agrarian region has seen unprecedented levels of devastation. Burned fields, abandoned farms... normalcy is to ever return to Radomskie, the Brigade will have to prove to be more than just a wartime unit."
unification.173.a: "This time... there probably were around Four Tank-Men."
