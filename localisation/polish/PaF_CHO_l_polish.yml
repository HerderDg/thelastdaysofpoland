unification.25.t: "[GetNewspaper]Republika Chorzowska jednoczy Śląską Metropolię!"
unification.25.desc: "For many years, people dreamed about a Polish Silesia. When it finally became reality, the dreams changed as well. Because as soon as it was shackled by Warsaw, Silesia started dreaming about freedom. Initially, they only wanted the autonomy they enjoyed during the Second Polish Republic. But as the years went by and the Polish state disintegrated, the revisionist voices grew louder. The Fall did not mean the end for everyone; for the Silesians, it was the beginning of a new path. Though the politically unstable Silesian league collapsed after failing to establish lasting peace due to factional struggles, Jerzy Gorzelik never gave up on trying to bring the region together. \n\nNowadays, it is from Chorzów that the heart of Silesia beats, the irreplaceable blue and yellow colors flutter in the wind, and with their newfound freedom, for the first time, the Silesians look into the future with hope for a better tomorrow."
