unification.91.t: "[GetNewspaper]Kociewie jednoczy Pomorze Gdańskie!"
unification.91.desc: "The reputation of being the only state in Pomerelia unconquered by Germans during their invasion of Poland is a truly fierce one. And it takes an equally tough man to lead such a polity. \n\nThe instability within the country meant an end to comfortable travels and armchair politicking for Wojciech Cejrowski as years of struggle proceeded. Organizing his nationalistic following into a true militia, the eccentric globetrotter has created a cult of personality based around himself. His word is near gospel in Kociewie, with men ready to fight and die on his command. Sharpened by past conflict, constantly drilled into perfect shape, the army shattered all remnants of the traitors in Pomerelia. Repressions against the enemies of Poland now follow, with show trials and public executions demonstrating the fate of anyone who dares turn their back on the Fatherland."
unification.91.a: "Poland needs a strong ruler, as befits a third world dictatorship."

As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
