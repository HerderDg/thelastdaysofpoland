unification.176.desc: "With banners unfurled and war horns sounding across the valleys, the Fields of Glory have risen to unite the Lesser Poland Voivodeship in a grand and audacious declaration of sovereignty. From the highlands of Podhale to the gates of Kraków, knights, peasant militias, and an alarming number of armored horsemen have sworn fealty, vowing to defend the land with steel, plow, and sheer audacity.\n\nA grand council was held in a field so vast that its boundaries were lost to legend, where warriors, scholars, and particularly ambitious beekeepers pledged to uphold the virtues of honor, strength, and good harvests. Under this newfound unity, trade shall flourish, mead shall flow, and no foe—be they foreign invader or an ill-mannered tax collector—shall challenge the will of the people. With steel in their hands and fire in their hearts, the Fields of Glory march forth into destiny."
