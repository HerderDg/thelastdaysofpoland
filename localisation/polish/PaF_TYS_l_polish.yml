unification.200.t: "[GetNewspaper]Tychy unites Silesian Voivodeship!"
unification.200.desc: "Always busy and never stopping, beating heart of Polish industry has seen much suffering and destruction in the past years, especially after the fall. With the economical riches disjointed and split between various factions, it was only a matter of time until one of the warring states emerges victorious in the power struggle for the most densely populated region of Poland. After months of military action and sly political machinations, it's the corporate state of Tychy that united the region. Utilising the various industrial and financial influences of corporations both local and foreign that are headquartered within the city, it has become a regional power. As local business gravitates to the stabilising force that united the Katowice urban area, Tychy emerged as one of the possible candidates to unite entire Silesia. Only time can tell if "Katowice's Corporate Backwater" maintains its dominant position."
unification.200.a: "Backwater no more, it seems."
