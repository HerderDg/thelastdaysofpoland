PaF_BBW_SMOG_ENDING_TEXT: "A dark abyss beckons in the Heart of Poland - a nightmare of our own creation. Lost in our twisted devotion to progress, we have paid the heaviest price of them all - we have seeped all life from this land, turning everything in our grasp into a smoldering wasteland. The restless flocks flee the crumbling remains of their homes in a desperate search for survival while the corrupted spawn of Ziemkiewicz's ideology fight among themselves to rule over the ashes. Yet there is no Poland left to speak of, just an ominous, low-hanging cloud of suffocating smog and the grim, bare earth beneath it. It will take a thousand years before this poisonous blight can be expunged. Until then, only darkness and misery shall call this region home."
PaF_BBW_ROXI_ENDING_TEXT: "Under Ziemkiewicz's reign, the Brotherhood has repeatedly shown itself to be a destructive force unable to look back at the consequences of its actions. Luckily for Poland, just as the nation teetered on the brink of oblivion, a force from within wrestled the reins of power to save the dying nation. Even to the most cynical eye, the ascent of Roksana Węgiel marks the beginning of a process that will long outlive her - healing. Each day that passes is a victory in its own right, each peaceful morning proof that doomsday has been staved off, at least for now. But this last-minute self-reflection will still have its toll. Poland's survival is not a given. It won't be until the final vestiges of smog are banished from the dusky air, and the last toxic molecules are washed out from the ground."

PaF_ATM_CALL_BERLIN_ENDING_TEXT: "The pen has proven to be mightier than the sword. With a single phone call, Jakub Wiech has upended the balance of power in Europe, forcing Germany into an unwilling submission. The black eagle's wings have been clipped, and in their place, a new force emerges, fuelled by the Atom's near-limitless power. Poland has taken off the shackles imposed by its coal dependency, thrusting itself into the position of a nuclear hegemon. Reborn from post-Fall destitution, the nation rises like an atomic phoenix, its ascent emanated by radioactive glow. The coming decade is sure to prove a challenge. Maintaining authority is far harder than claiming it, and to not rest on one's laurels will require a particularly apt helmsman, but for a visionary such as the Great Ecologist, this victory is not an ending but merely a new beginning."
PaF_ATM_WHAT_BERLIN_ENDING_TEXT: "The cold dagger of revenge twists its way into the heart of Germany. Just as Bałuty burned in nuclear flame nearly twenty years ago, the same fate has now befallen the administrative center of the failed European project - Berlin. In a single precise strike, one of the continent's largest metropolises has been wiped off the map along with its millions of inhabitants. The Germans will claim it was an act of unprecedented terrorism. Their voice matters not. To us, it was an act of just retribution, our return onto the global scale emblazoned in atomic radiance. Our eternal enemy has at last been felled by the victorious Crusaders, and the Polish flag waves proudly along with the French banner on conquered territory. It will stay there until the Germans' hegemonic dreams are completely shattered."

PaF_CAL_POPULARES_ENDING_TEXT: "When Ricardus took the throne of Calisia, he found it a nation of ruin, on its last legs, sandwiched between Germanic invaders and Venedic warlords. After decades of reforms and campaigns, age has at last caught up with the insuperable titan, yet not before he turned the Empire into a nation of white, shining marble. Having finally broken free from the Senate's factionalism and overcome the constraints of the Optimates' faux populism, the Emperor and his tenderfoot successor are free to pursue the policies that far outweigh any personal gravitas they could master. For the newly-crowned Ignatius, it is the sovereign's responsibility to provide for each of his subjects, and with an Empire this vast and diverse, maintaining internal cohesion may prove to be a challenge. Yet, as Calisia braces for its fourth decade, the dream of Ricardus remains well-alive, guiding it to further glory."
PaF_CAL_OPTIMATES_ENDING_TEXT: "At first, the incorporation of the Optimates into Calisia's imperial system was little more than a token gift to the old elites; a single drop of oligarchic self-servedness in a sea of popular primacy. Yet the forces of inertia are stronger than the winds of change, and over time, the corruptive stain would spread, diluting the foundational mission of the Empire. With a dagger in hand, the Lynx has taken over, securing a monopoly on power and a stranglehold over the throne. Calisia may be triumphant, emblazoned in glory and splendor, but in the Imperial Palace, the celebrations ring hollow, and the victory feels bittersweet at best. As he raises a glass of the finest Latium, Antonius can't help but ponder the legacy left behind by his father. The sweet notes remind him of his failure, and enflame the desire to break free from the Optimates' grasp."
PaF_CAL_POSTCALISIA_ENDING_TEXT: "Those who tell the tales of Calisia remember it as a colossus, a hegemon, but above all, a promise of better times for a region devoid of any hope. Yet, as the titan grew, the faults in its system began to progressively rot the shaky foundation, leaving the Empire vulnerable in the face of existential threat. The Senate's meager reforms could do little to stem the overwhelming tide, and so the last bastion of civilization fell to the barbarian onslaught. The chronicles will keep the memory alive for centuries, and the ruins will remain for millennia, but the dream of Ricardus has been irretrievably lost. Without it, having regressed to the level of semi-organized chiefdoms, Central Europe has entered the second Dark Ages. For the foreseeable future, that is where it shall remain."
PaF_CAL_TRIUMVIRATE_ENDING_TEXT: "To rule over a territory as vast as Polonia, any prospective empire would, at the very least, require a consistent political direction to hold itself together. Yet, having fallen to the rotten excesses of ambition, Calisia finds itself splintered, divided into two squabbling parts that greedily eye each other's land. As the contrasts between the West and the East grow, distinct identities begin to emerge between the two imperial realms, and the once-temporary borders carved out ad hoc with the blade of the same gladius that once killed Emperor Ricardus, solidify into a permanent divider between the civilizations. As the curtain falls, it is becoming increasingly clearer that Calisia may never again mend the rift, and the families torn apart by the whirlwind of conflicts will fail to get their happy end."
PaF_CAL_PRT_EMPIRE_ENDING_TEXT: "The death of a colossus leaves a monumental gap to fill by anyone who would dare try to reign in his stead. Ricardus' untimely, gladius-induced passing created a vacuum, one readily filled by the power-hungry Praetorians. However, to scheme and to rule require entirely different skill sets, and, thus, the Guard was left with no choice but to crown their chosen figurehead. Brash, arrogant, self-serving; Martinus Naimanus possesses none of the skills necessary for a good monarch, but that is precisely what makes him the perfect puppet. A rabid dog now sits on the Calisian throne, yanked by his leash whenever it steps out of line. With the only other choice being to back the semi-legitimate rule of a man totally unsuited for any noble title, the Praetorians have somehow achieved the impossible - become the sensible option in the eyes of the people."
PaF_CAL_PRT_RESPUBLICA_ENDING_TEXT: "Since the earliest days of Calisia, the Res Publica symbolized the ultimate virtue - a state ruled by the democratic will of the people. It was always a profound contradiction; for how can the voice of the plebs matter when it's the Emperor's whim influencing every decision? Now that the monarch lies dead and his imperial standard flies no more, the people have become the masters of their own destiny, at least on paper, as never before has their agency been so suppressed. Despite the facade of democracy, the twin flames of the Praetorians and the Optimates diligently ensure that no political force can emerge to challenge their autocratic inclinations. The plebeians may have their Res Publica, pretending they have even the slightest say in how it operates, but never shall they be truly free."
