unification.178.t: "[GetNewspaper]Republika Podbeskidzia jednoczy Beskidy!"
unification.178.desc: "In a predictable but somewhat mundane turn of events, the civilian government of Bielsko-Biała has claimed dominion over the miserable piece of the Carpathian Mountains known as Podhale. This triumph was secured by the last sliver of sanity left over in the rump city-state or, alternatively, some kind of underhanded Euroliberal support. Either way, historians will make sense of it, as they always do. \n\nThe wounds of the brotherly war in the region won't easily heal, especially for a city that has already suffered considerable decline before the Fall. Various speculations have been made regarding the future developments in the freshly established republic, primarily concerning the rebuilding of the textile industry or the expansion of the hydroelectric network. It is certain, however, that the new government prefers reconstruction, stability, and defense over expansion, and for a while, peace may actually last."
unification.178.a: "Chwila wytchnienia?"
