unification.72.desc: "Tonight, fragments of the S3, 24 and 92 connecting Gorzów Wielkopolski with Poznań will relive their pre-Fall lives for a day, as a massive horde of TIR trucks, motorbikes and cars is set to roll from one city to another in a Roman-style triumph celebrating the complete conquest of the northern halves of Lubusz and Greater Polish voivodeships by the so-called Motorcracy of Gorzów - a joint ''government'' of marauding roughnecks united in their love of breakneck speeds. \n\nDespite the limited availability of fuel in the country, the veteran speedfreaks of the Motorcracy overtook the local warlording Poles and Germans and made it to the finish line, securing the trophy that is northern Greater Poland for themselves."

As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
