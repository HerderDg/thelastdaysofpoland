unification.57.t: "[GetNewspaper]Państwo Alkoholickie jednoczy region wrocławski!"
unification.57.desc: "Disturbing reports from the direction of Wrocław are reaching outlets all across the country. Over the past months, half of Lower Silesia has been united piece by piece by terro-commandos of the Alcoholy State - a military junta of bums and drunks under the leadership of Generalissimo Czak Noris - a man with a powerful body and even greater political power. Emerging as a result of a split between the alcoholics from Świdnica and Dzierżoniów, Czak's fighters were initially seen as the weaker yet far more fierce of the two forces, with their radicalism contributing to their eventual victory. The state enforces its authoritarian alcoholic caste doctrine by any means, including terrorism and repressions on an overwhelming, systemic scale, and at the time of publishing, the last points of resistance are being brutally suppressed. Likely, the time will now come for them to take their revenge and consolidate their dominion so that no one dares to oppose them again."
unification.57.a: "Miejmy nadzieję że święty napitek się nie skończy."

As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
