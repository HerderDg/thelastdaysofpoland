unification.147.t: "[GetNewspaper]AGH jednoczy Małopolskę!"
unification.147.desc: "The Free City of Kraków - the sole unaltered vestige of pre-Fall Poland, has, itself, fallen. And though academics rose to fill the vacuum left behind by Majchrowski's collapse, here, too, did a conservative force threaten to prolong the broken system. Yet, as per the words of the infallible adage, the modern ways of the AGH have inevitably triumphed over the Jagiellonians' decrepit thought, creating a wave of enthusiasm and popular support sufficient to lead the institution to Lesser Poland's complete subjugation. Although he now formally stands as the region's sole highest authority, Rector Lis has been forced to rely heavily upon local corporations to fill and finance his overstretched administration. Still, the locals cheer as AGH's victory and grandiose visions spark dreams of a future technological golden age for the backward country. For now, however, these hopes remain distant, as at any point, a warlord's might may render them all moot."
unification.147.a: "Can progress really emerge from Europe's backwater?"

super.147.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.147.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.147.a: "United at last."
