 fluff_france_news.1.t: "[GetNewspaper]Marine Le Pen wins French Presidency"
 fluff_france_news.1.desc: "In a major upset that shook the French political establishment to its core, it is becoming increasingly clear that the country's traditional forces have been unseated by a firebrand outsider. While the final results are still being tallied, primarily in the overseas departments, major pundits have reached a consensus that Marine Le Pen will assume the presidency following perhaps the nation's most heated and divisive campaign to date. Overshadowed by France's controversial involvement in the so-called 'Polish Intervention,' the election was defined by a sharp increase in populist rhetoric aimed against its European partners. On the international stage, the victory of Le Pen is almost certain to mean a significant diplomatic realignment, with clear warning signs for Brussels and Berlin that the European Dream may soon be at risk."

 fluff_france_news.4.t: "[GetNewspaper]European Unity Shattered"
 fluff_france_news.4.desc: "Today, any hopes that France and Germany might still be able to reconcile their differences have been dashed, with President [FRA.GetLeader]'s condemnation of their eastern neighbor, stating that 'in its present form the Union is no longer an association of free nations but rather a vessel of Berlin's imperialism.' Following the fiery speech, French units left their garrison posts in occupied Polish territory and made their way home in a severe blow to the campaign's future that destabilized a number of key strategic positions. Now, as the two rivals enter a phase of renewed hostility, reports from Paris speak of a preventive mobilization of the nation's military along the Alsatian border as a show of force meant to deter any retaliation attempts from the European hegemon. With a new power center emerging in the region, nations dissatisfied with Germany's recent actions have increasingly welcomed the French political leadership."
 fluff_france_news.4.a: "Perhaps even Poland will be able to take advantage of the chaos."

 fluff_france_news.5.t: "[GetNewspaper]German forces withdraw from Poland"
 fluff_france_news.5.desc: "In the wake of recent tensions within the Union, the German High Command has confirmed that a general order has been given to all units stationed within the Polish Territories to return to their bases after nearly two years of occupation. Though sources within the army claim that the move is only a temporary regrouping that will help bolster its long-term presence in the area and that the leaders of the allied 'Eurokommissariats' have been sufficiently prepared to handle internal affairs without Berlin's aid, multiple experts see it as a desperate band-aid to a rapidly spiraling problem. Despite repeated reassurances, the situation on the ground in the fractured republic remains far from stable, and the provisional actions of the local leaders to prevent immediate fallout raise questions as to whether the directive was even consulted with them in the first place."
