unification.193.t: "[GetNewspaper]Republic of Radomsko unifies Łódź Voivodeship"
unification.193.desc: "The trauma of the Fall combined with the tragedy of Bałuty resulted in Łódzkie becoming a breeding ground for the most outlandish and radical factions known to men. Because of that many overlooked the unsuspecting and ordinary last vestige of the former government's control over Łódzkie ruled by the three last voivodes. Initially, they tried to take control over the capital of the voivodeship, alas general instability after the nuclear catastrophe and the liberal leanings of Łódź's population, their endeavor proved unsuccessful. They were forced to retreat to Radomsko, a conservative stronghold at the edge of the voivodeship. Rising from the bottom, they built their support in the province more gradually and eventually dominated the voivodeship. Even the defiant Łódź now accepted their policy. Either, because of the adoption of liberal conservatism by the new elites, or because other warlords showed them how unhinged they would have been."
unification.193.a: "Democracy in Łódzkie"
