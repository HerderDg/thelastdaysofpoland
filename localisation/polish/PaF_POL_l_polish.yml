POLITICS_MATEUSZ_MORAWIECKI_DESC: "It's hard to admit you've done something wrong – especially if everything went wrong. Mateusz Morawiecki, fortunately, has more than enough of other factors to blame. \n\nOf course, the opposition would be first on that list. It has been relieving to see them drop their masks, standing tall over native population as alienated oppressors, backed by European military might. His party colleagues would be next – they've been mental adolescents, like Duda, madmen, like Macierewicz, psychopaths, like Ziobro, or just Sasin, like Sasin. Leftists and right-wing extremists emerged from beneath the ground like cockroaches, ready to feast on the carcass. And the bomb – Morawiecki really did learn to stop worrying and love it. For the bomb has the power to make anyone forget. \n\nTaxes, alarming illegalism, nepotism and incompetence, more taxes, inflation, sugar tax, reckless social spending, rising VAT rates, Catholic bigotry, throttling minorities, a few more taxes – all these things fade in the memory with every day with Morawiecki still in power. Although exiled from the capital, Morawiecki represents the continued existence of the legal government, and has by far the greatest legitimacy among all states in Poland. Holding fast to power, Morawiecki hasn't given up his plans for the development of Poland. He knows Poland and the Poles well, and now, when there's so little to lose, he will employ this knowledge to the fullest. Law and Justice will prevail, one way or the other. \n\nAt least he won't have to visit Bałuty this time."

unification.111.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Third Polish Republic unifies Northern Mazovia!"
unification.111.desc: "The legal government of the Third Polish Republic, exiled in Legionowo since the Fall, has just cemented its control over northern Mazovia, with territory spanning all counties north of Warsaw. Although the majority of the country slipped out of their hands many years ago, Morawiecki's regime still enjoys a great deal of legitimacy, and so, the former PiS electorate has reacted positively to this news, proving a return to power by the overthrown government to not be out of the question. However, enemies surround them on all sides, with multiple hostile rival governments just beyond their borders. With such unprecedented political fragmentation, it is hard to tell whether the Polish people's respect for their old institutions is great enough to overpower their current political allegiances, but the administrators of PiS will definitely be forced to adapt to the new civil war reality if they aspire to one day regain control over Poland."
