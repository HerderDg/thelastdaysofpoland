STE_piotr_Krzystek_desc: "Elected as Mayor of Szczecin all the way back in 2006, Piotr Krzystek has been resisting against PiS policies alongside with his contemporary mayors from other western cities. After falling out of grace with Donald Tusk in 2010, he was a bulwark of nonpartisanship on the edge of a tempestous political storm that took over Poland, especially when Warsaw sent the military to put down riots in 2025.\n\nUpon the announcement of the Eurokorps intervention on request of Tusk, unnotified Krzystek welcomed the mainly German troops in the city. On one hand, his ideology gravitated way closer to Berlin than to Warsaw, on the other, the geographical location of Szczecin so close to the German border put it in a precarious position, so the intervention was welcomed without resistance. However what was meant to be a peaceful operation, soon turned to be an all out war with the loyalist units of the Polish army.\n\nKrzystek was deposed from his position as situation on the front worsened. The new German administration called it "prevention from a possible local insurgency", but in his mind it was surely a petty revenge from Tusk. The ex-mayor went into hiding and formed an underground resistance group, the Griffin Guard, with the aim to depose the occupying German forces.\n\nNow, after months of conflict with local authorities, with support from two out of three Hanza corporations, victory has finally been achieved. As the Eurokorps retreated, the Gryphon flies over Szczecin once more. Now Krzystek, as the leader of a Western Pomeranian powerhouse can consolidate his rule and his loyal populace can finally live free from mistakes of both Warsaw and Berlin."
STE_lindner_desc: "The leader of the Freie Demokratische Partei and former Minister of Finance of the Eurostaat, upon less than fruitful power struggles in Berlin on the eve of the intervention, has been appointed the Gouverneur of the Free City of Stettin. Whether the move was truly a promotion, as the lavish ceremony at the old Pomeranian Dukes' castle would seem to suggest, or simply a punishment for speaking out too loudly against his colleagues' actions during the operation remains unknown, at least officially; however, being pushed aside, thrown out from the halls of the Bundestag to guard an unwilling prize of a conflict he personally opposed has left Christian Lindner feeling strongly embittered towards his compatriots in Berlin.\n\nThe new governor is trying desperately to maintain order and bring prosperity to the Lübeck of Vorpommern, yet constant protests and insurgent activities of the Polish citizenry make the process all but easy. Desperate to ascertain a modicum of autonomy from the controlling grasp of Eurokommissariat Westpolen and too proud to rely on aid from those who spurned him, Lindner has been forced to make pragmatic deals with those he was supposed to govern with a strong hand, stacking his administration with advisors from the region's influential corporations: Polsteam, Netto, and Chemiewerke Pölitz.\n\nWhile Lindner hoped that the considerable economic privileges granted to the local companies would help him maintain order, he soon found himself backed into yet another corner. Seeing the influence they could yield if they combined their operations, the Big Three joined forces, forming the Hanseatic Guild - an organization that quickly established an oligopoly on the city's whole financial sector, effectively tying the noose on which to hang the governor should he ever step out of line.\n\nPlagued with violent insurgents and ruthless capitalists, Lindner's administration stands on dangerously shaky ground. For now, the Stadtpolizei, with middling support from the local garrison of Eurokorps from Eurokommissariat Westpolen, maintains the fragile peace, or at least the illusion thereof, but it remains to be seen whether this balance shall hold, or if, just like when German formations rolled through Polish soil, Stettin is doomed to be the first domino to fall."

Even with many stores destroyed, looted or abandoned it still operates on Polish soil in reduced capacity, bringing the wonders of consumerism to towns and cities not only of Pomerania, but the whole of Poland."

STE_griffon_partisans_desc: "The city of Stettin is plagued with countless bands of insurgents who sabotage the regime at just about every level of operation. Subversive activity ranges from plastering public spaces with anti-government flyers and indiscriminate vandalism to, at times, an armed militia that often clashes with the local police forces. The Stadtpolizei is spread thin trying to put out the fires of rebellion, but just like a hydra, one flame extinguished causes two more to start elsewhere. Backed against the increasingly enclosing walls, we are struggling to get anything done in the current situation."
STE_anti_partisan: "Anti-Guerilla Operations"
STE_anti_partisan_desc: "The recent influx of fresh officers and newly ingrained zeal in the form of various overly generous bonuses have allowed the Stadtpolizei to resist and push back against local insurgencies. With the tide turning in favor of the government, a large-scale witch hunt spearheaded by the Eurokorps has begun across the entire city and its surroundings to snuff out any remaining forms of organized resistance. Lindner's administration is hopeful that this final crackdown will be enough to quell the rebellious spirit of the populace."

And even with our soldiers at their gates, they had the gall to request a 'peaceful' accession back into our fold, threatening to destroy what Polish hands built and improved for over 60 years. Now back in the Hanseatic Guild, we're forced to make deals and amends, as if nothing happened.\n\n§YLoyal to the German cause and their mission to 'stabilize' Poland by whatever means necessary, expect them to be an obstructive and traitorous force.

After the acquisition of the Polish branch of Tesco in 2020 it became one of the biggest players in the retail industry - and their supermarkets in Poland accounted for almost half of their stores worldwide.\n\nIt came as no surprise that Netto Polska remained a highly independent player in post-intervention affairs. Even with many stores destroyed, looted or abandoned it still operates on Polish soil in reduced capacity, bringing the wonders of consumerism to towns and cities not only of Pomerania, but the whole of Poland. All that sweet revenue benefits them - mostly. But when the demise of Eurokomissarriats became an inevitable reality they threw their weight behind us, greatly helping the guerilla in our pursuit for independence.

Our country faces numerous challenges before we can rest peacefully, but the hope for a better future remains unchangeable. The day of the Uprising will always be remembered, and those who lost their lives for the cause of freedom will always be praised. President Krzystek has declared that day an official holiday.

To formalise a parlimentary spectrum and maintain legitimacy, delegates from two major political organisations have been invited to the city hall to organise the structure of the new presidential council. Newly formed government of Szczecin will consist of an equal amount of councillors from two organisations that crystallized during Szczecinian insurgency - the progressive Summer Union and the Conservative-Liberal Party "Castle", with President Krzystek as the unaffiliated leader. Hopes are high that this uneasy alliance across the political spectrum will be able to work together and lead Szczecin in these uncertain times."

The newly appointed Overseer has begun to recruit specialist advisors to his cabinet, preparing to face a chaotic scene that emerged following the German exodus.

Armed patrols have been deployed, and residents outside their homes after dark face stop-and-search procedures, with detainment possible on suspicion alone. The trigger? A rise in violent incidents and the reappearance of a now-infamous slogan-"Niebko Terror"-spray-painted across a central bridge. Believed to be the work of local ultras, the phrase has become a symbol of chaotic defiance and urban fear. One officer, off the record, said bluntly: "Bandits? In my Szczecin? Not a chance."

Although this arrangement may not sit well with Krzystek, we have no choice but to grant them certain favors.

People will celebrate his name for many days, weeks, and months. However, it wasn't always this way. Krzystek transitioned from a partisan with no clear vision for improvement to a formidable candidate for reunifying the country.

These shipyards were also the stage for historic workers' strikes that led to key concessions from the Polish United Workers' Party. Let us honor this industrial heart of our city by developing and revitalizing these sites, ensuring they continue to provide work and forge the future of our region and country. The best interests of the state of Szczecin align with our own best interests."
STE_deep_water_port_in_swinoujscie: "Deep Water Port in Świnoujście"
STE_deep_water_port_in_swinoujscie_desc: "Świnoujście is a crucial maritime hub that connects Szczecin to the Baltic Sea, serving as an essential gateway for international trade. In the past, when Poland was united, there was an ambitious plan to construct a deep-sea port in the city. Although this vision was disrupted by civil war, there is now renewed hope for its revival. Reactivating this project would significantly boost trade with our closest partners, enhance the region's strategic importance, and generate substantial economic benefits for our company. This project represents a promising future for us and is just the first of many investments Polsteam plans to make in the region."
STE_infrapark_pomerania: "Infrapark Pomerania"
STE_infrapark_pomerania_desc: "In the past, our country established multiple Infraparks throughout Poland. Now, we are ready to set one up in Pomerania. We will support entrepreneurs by offering reduced taxes and incentives, promoting the growth of heavy industry in a region that has long been underserved. This initiative is crucial for our state, as heavy industry has faced neglect for years. We have to catch up with other regions to ensure prosperity and long-term stability. Polsteam will play a key role in these changes, providing essential guidance and assistance to interested companies."
STE_armed_river_barges: "Armed River Barges"
STE_armed_river_barges_desc: "The Oder River was and still is an important trade route. Before the collapse of Poland, barges filled with all kinds of goods flowed down from the southern parts of the country along the river. Every day, residents of Szczecin could see them moored at the waterfront and small tugboats pushing them to the harbor. Many of these vessels are still in Szczecin and no longer serve their original function - we will convert them into shipyards for our navy. That could significantly improve the mutual trade with other warlords of Poland."

STE_arm_the_nawigator_xxi_desc: "Our navy currently lacks sufficient ships to designate a flagship. When the day of the fall arrived, many of our vessels were either destroyed or left to deteriorate. However, we have one ship capable of fulfilling this essential role: the Navigator XXI. Once the pride of the Maritime University of Szczecin, it served as a training ship. Given our current circumstances, we no longer have many people to train in this capacity. Therefore, the Navigator XXI is the ideal vessel for this mission. Let's board, everyone! It is time to conquer the Polish rivers"

It plays a crucial role in the success of our company, as many of our employees are proud graduates of the university. To ensure continued growth and greatness, the Polsteam board has decided to strengthen our partnership with the university. We are committed to supporting its expansion, recognizing that our investment in its future is an investment in our own. In the coming years, we could completely rebuild ourselves and even surpass the state we were in before the collapse."
STE_the_tricity_special_economic_zone: "The Tricity Special Economic Zone"
STE_the_tricity_special_economic_zone_desc: "Not too long ago, Polsteam was considered the weakest company in the Hanseatic Guild. We had to rely on outdated equipment, hoping that one day we could compete with Netto and Chemiewerke. Now, that dream is becoming a reality. The Krzystek government has granted us exclusive economic rights over heavy industry in the Tricity area. From this point forward, we will focus all our efforts on industrializing the northern parts of Poland, aiming to surpass the Silesian industrialized zone. Our significant involvement in this endeavor will not only secure a prosperous future for Poland but also generate substantial revenue for us."
STE_monopoly_on_marine_trade: "Monopoly On Marine Trade"
STE_monopoly_on_marine_trade_desc: "Our long journey has finally reached a significant milestone. While there is still much to accomplish, we have achieved things that once seemed impossible. Polsteam now fully controls the influx of the Vistula and Oder rivers, and we have access to every port in Poland. We have established a monopoly over the maritime industry, with every trade route to the north passing through us. As a result, our profits will far exceed our previous dreams.\n\nNevertheless, we remain committed not just to our own success but to the well-being of the entire country. Poland's future relies on us. With companies like Chemiewerke and Netto focusing solely on their interests, we stand as the last loyal company dedicated to our nation.\n\n§RPoland is not yet lost.§!"

Until now, our administration has operated more like a provisional authority than a legitimate democratic institution. But the time has come to change that. Temporary measures are no longer sufficient as we now govern a significant population. It is time to establish a stable and lasting foundation for our citizens.

Krzystek, along with Union and ZKL leaders and his closest allies, discusses the successful unification of the voivodeship. However, the path ahead is filled with challenges, as uniting Poland will be bloody and fraught with opposition.\n\nTo address these challenges, we cannot act alone. It is essential to seek allies beyond the European Union. Traditional alliances have limitations, so we must forge new strategic partnerships with those who share our objectives. Only by looking beyond our country can we gather the support necessary to achieve our vision for Poland."

In response, the government of Szczecin warmly invites qualified Polish citizens living in the United Kingdom to return home.\n\nThose who choose to come back will be provided with housing, stable and well-paid employment, and preferential contracts tailored to their skills. Additional support will be offered to ease the transition for individuals and families. Poland will not rebuild itself; every person willing to take part in the effort of national rebuilding is not only needed, but sincerely welcome"

Given the ongoing challenges in our nation, seeking their assistance would be a prudent choice for our government. After extensive negotiations and establishing our position in the context of Polish reunification, we have successfully secured the international support we urgently needed.\n\nSince the successful Griffin rebellion, humanitarian aid has been a top priority for us. With OXFAM's support, we are optimistic about achieving our dream of building a stable and prosperous nation that is recognized internationally.

STE_towards_recognition_desc: "We are entering a new chapter as a nation. After years of effort, we are finally prepared to hold proper democratic elections. In this process, we must not exclude the reintegrated territories or former influential members of the political spectrum, particularly those affiliated with PiS and PO. The Summer Union and the Castle will extend a hand to politicians who once served under the Świnoujście administration and the Eurocommissariat of Westpolen, provided they openly condemn both the German invasion and all actions carried out on Polish soil, as well as the policies of PiS that contributed to Poland's collapse."

STE_our_house_of_commons_desc: "Our current parliamentary system was established as a temporary measure - it was never intended to serve as a permanent framework. As we approach the upcoming elections, it is essential that we reform them. Ensuring the stability and fairness of these elections is one of our government's highest priorities. If we are truly committed to building a just and democratic state, we must first set clear and equitable rules for the political process, including a thorough revision of the single-member constituency system. Only by laying strong institutional foundations can we ensure that the democracy we build will survive."

Those selected will hold the title of Protector for life, ensuring long-term continuity and dedication to the Republic's core values.

Now, only one step remains: the election of a new parliament that will represent the will of the people. After years of conflict, division, and hardship, it is time to exercise the hard-won rights of citizenship.

Known for his deep interest in the British political system, Professor Toszek's influence may steer our institutions in a new, not previously unexplored direction. While some speculate that he will act as the president's unofficial envoy, it is evident that his appointment serves the greater national interest.

President Piotr Krzystek will convene with his closest advisors and the leaders of the two largest political parties. Reliable sources suggest that the primary topic of discussion will be the reconstruction of the city of Szczecin and the wider region of the former Western Pomerania Voivodeship. The meeting will also aim to ensure that the national rebuilding process proceeds smoothly, free of political conflict, disputes, or factional clashes between Castle and Summer Union."

STE_national_healthcare_act_of_date_desc: "Both the Summer Union and the Castle agree that a form of national healthcare is essential to guarantee the well-being and happiness of every citizen. However, each party envisions a different model: the Union advocates for the Beveridge system, while the Castle supports a partial reimbursement approach. The debate has sparked intense public interest and growing media coverage, as healthcare remains a deeply personal issue for many. Ultimately, the final decision rests with the ruling party, which will have to weigh both proposals carefully before shaping the future of the nation's healthcare system."

STE_golden_calf_scripted: "Leash the Golden Calf"
STE_leash_the_golden_calf_desc: "A fully free market, under current conditions, would be detrimental to our national interests. As a developing country without a solid industrial base or firm control over key sectors, we require at least a minimal level of regulation to ensure stability and long-term growth. Encouragingly, both sides of parliament agree on the need for oversight. The concern, however, lies in the government's continued hesitation to assert economic independence. There is growing unease that certain foreign actors hold disproportionate sway over domestic policy. The time has come for national leadership to prioritise the country's needs over outside influence."
STE_education_act_of_date: "Education Act of [GetYear]"
STE_education_act_of_date_desc: "After restoring the core institutions of the state, the government will now focus on reforming and revitalizing the nation's education system. President Piotr Krzystek has pledged to prioritize the reconstruction and reopening of schools that were damaged during the German invasion, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to learn in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nEqually important is the revival of local universities and polytechnic institutions, which will play a critical role in shaping the country's intellectual and technological future.\n\n An educated and informed society is the strongest safeguard against the mistakes of the past, such as the rise of the PiS government. We must ensure that such democratic backsliding is never repeated."
STE_unionisation: "Unionisation"
STE_unionisation_desc: "The industrial sector of West Pomerania, excluding PŻM and its subsidiary companies, is currently poorly organized. Polish trade unions were dismantled during the intervention, following the German counterinsurgency policies.\n\nIn response, the government encourages and actively supports the formation of new trade unions that unite workers from similar sectors. This initiative aims to strengthen workers' positions against corporate dominance and to help the state better identify and address the challenges faced by the working population.\n\nA robust network of unions will also contribute to long-term economic stability by fostering dialogue between labor and industry. Moreover, it reflects the government's commitment to rebuilding not just infrastructure, but the democratic foundations of labor rights."
STE_advisory_devolution: "Advisory Devolution"
STE_advisory_devolution_desc: "Decision-making cannot be confined solely to the central level. The government acknowledges the need for external input, local voices that can guide and support it in addressing the most pressing national issues. Nonetheless, we all know that democracy is not a caucus, obtaining a fixed term of office by promises, and then doing what it likes with the people. We hold that there ought to be a constant relationship between the rulers and the people. "Government of the people, by the people, for the people," still remains the sovereign definition of democracy."
STE_stop_go_economics: "'Stop, Go' Economics"
STE_stop_go_economics_desc: "In a surprising move, the government has unveiled its adoption of a so-called "Stop-Go" economic policy - a strategy marked by short bursts of rapid growth followed by abrupt slowdowns. Officials claim this flexible approach will allow the state to "react dynamically" to market shifts.\n\nHowever, critics warn that it signals a return to instability. The policy risks undermining long-term development, leaving workers, unions, and smaller industries vulnerable to sudden cutbacks and inconsistent support. As West Pomerania struggles to rebuild, this erratic direction may deepen uncertainty instead of resolving it."
STE_mantain_a_tight_grip: "Maintain a Tight Grip"
STE_mantain_a_tight_grip_desc: "Although the military aspects of the state of emergency are gradually reducing, it is still too early to lift it completely. The government will maintain a strong, civilian-focused approach to ensure economic stability through ongoing price controls, rationing, and oversight of key sectors.\n\nWe will not relinquish control over essential aspects of daily life until we are confident that every household can achieve a fair and sustainable standard of living. That is not a measure of oppression; relatively, it is a guaranteed protection during our recovery. The return to full normalcy must be built on stable, inclusive, and resilient foundations."
STE_nationalise_captured_assets: "Nationalise Captured Assets"
STE_nationalise_captured_assets_desc: "The nationalization of privatized industrial infrastructure will ensure the state's complete control over production lines and key supply chains. That decision is not just ideological; it is practical, allowing industrial output to be adjusted in real time to meet changing market demands and social needs.\n\nBy eliminating foreign and speculative interests from strategic sectors, we can allocate resources more efficiently, prioritize reconstruction efforts, and respond better to crises. National oversight also enables us to guarantee fair labor practices, stabilize prices, and prevent exploitative monopolies.\n\nThis policy will establish a self-reliant economy that prioritizes its citizens and is prepared to face the long-term challenges of recovery and development."
STE_secure_production: "Secure Production"
STE_secure_production_desc: "The more we focus on re-equipping and modernizing our productive capacities, especially in key sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and infrastructure, the sooner we can achieve stable and self-sustaining production. This initiative is not just technical; it is strategic. By investing in stronger and more resilient production systems today, we can accelerate our economic recovery, reduce dependence on external pressures, and ultimately improve the standard of living for all citizens.\n\nModernization is a necessity. Each improvement in machinery, processes, and coordination enhances our ability to meet essential needs, minimize waste, and create a more equitable and efficient economy. A short-term emphasis on production security will lead to long-term benefits in prosperity, stability, and national well-being."
STE_rationalizing_rationing: "Rationalizing Rationing"
STE_rationalizing_rationing_desc: "The expectation that war-damaged agricultural lands can fully satisfy the food demands of cities and towns is currently unrealistic. This situation would place excessive social and economic pressure on rural communities. Therefore, we must continue to promote restraint in consumption and maintain the food rationing system to ensure equitable distribution of available resources.\n\nThanks to the unification of the voivodeship and improved coordination of our agricultural production and distribution networks, we can cautiously begin to ease some of these restrictions. However, it remains vital for all citizens to be mindful of their consumption and support these measures as we work towards restoring food security and rebuilding a sustainable agricultural foundation."
STE_state_housing: "State Housing"
STE_state_housing_desc: "We will initiate large-scale, state-led housing projects in every city, town, and bigger village to ensure every resident has a roof over their head as quickly as possible. These homes will not be luxurious; this is not a time for extravagance. Instead, they will be practical, standardized dwellings designed to efficiently and equitably meet basic living needs.\n\nBy prioritizing uniformity, we can ensure speed, cost-effectiveness, and fairness. In the face of crisis and displacement, our focus is not on opulence but on providing dignity, shelter, and a stable foundation on which our country can be rebuilt."
STE_mantainining_employment: "Maintaining Employment"
STE_mantainining_employment_desc: "Ensuring stable employment requires keeping key industries operational. The government will focus on sectors most vulnerable to economic fluctuations, particularly those reliant on capital investment and exports.\n\nMaintaining a steady pace of construction in housing, factories, and infrastructure is a top priority, as it represents nearly half of national capital spending. We will work closely with major industries and public bodies to coordinate long-term investments aimed at preventing instability.\n\nIn urgent situations, we will support the population through tax relief, guaranteed loans, and other direct assistance. Economic resilience depends on preparedness rather than improvised responses."
STE_wind_down_the_gears_of_war: "Wind Down the Gears of War"
STE_wind_down_the_gears_of_war_desc: "The war for the unification of the voivodeship is long over. What remains now is the far more difficult task of building something lasting for years. The temporary suspension of civil norms, initially justified by necessity, will soon end. Instead of maintaining the framework of a state of emergency, the government has proposed a carefully timed strategy of gradual economic reactivation. The approach prioritises long-term stability, focusing on a controlled "thaw" of the economy. This strategy has been presented as the only responsible course of action, measured, deliberate, and aimed at securing prosperity in the years to come."
STE_partners_in_business: "Partners in Business"
STE_partners_in_business_desc: "Smaller enterprises acquired during the unification will be placed under the supervision of the Hanseatic Guild. Some may see this move as controversial or even unjust, especially those advocating for full state ownership. However, the decision reflects a pragmatic approach which is aimed at ensuring economic stability and continuity. Nationalisation, which stands fully against ZKL beliefs, could lead to administrative chaos, sudden disruptions in supply chains, and the loss of experienced local management. The Hanseatic oversight will guarantee that these businesses remain operational, competitive, and integrated into a broader regional market. It is a compromise, not without cost, but necessary for the recovery of our nation's economy."
STE_housing_contracts: "Housing Contracts"
STE_housing_contracts_desc: "While the state possesses the capacity to carry out key infrastructure and construction projects independently, experience shows that the inclusion of private businesses and corporate partners leads to significantly greater efficiency. By involving the private sector, we can accelerate project timelines, reduce overall costs, and ensure higher standards of quality and innovation. Moreover, public-private cooperation allows us to better allocate national resources, attract investment, and stimulate local economies. This approach not only delivers immediate benefits but also lays the foundation for sustainable growth and long-term prosperity. In times of reconstruction, pragmatism must prevail over outdated economic dogmas."
STE_security_and_incentive: "Security & Incentive"
STE_security_and_incentive_desc: "The government reaffirms its commitment to building an economy where effort is rewarded and leadership is earned. To encourage initiative and productivity, direct taxation and wage structures will be adjusted. While fair base wages will remain guaranteed, performance-based bonuses and piece-rate systems will be promoted across various sectors, with methods tailored to individual industries.\n\nAdditionally, a clear standard for leadership will be maintained. Every position, from the workshop to the boardroom, must be open to those best qualified to serve. Advancement will be based on merit rather than privilege, ensuring that talent, loyalty, and dedication lead our national recovery."
STE_restore_village_life: "Restore Village Life"
STE_restore_village_life_desc: "A vigorous campaign must be launched to boost the productivity of Pomeranian farms and gardens. Farmers have long lacked clear direction, as well as access to essential tools, machinery, feed, and fertilisers necessary to expand domestic food production. Guaranteed markets and fair, profitable prices must be ensured so that everyone in the industry understands what is expected of them. Increased output, particularly of eggs, bacon, and other livestock products, is urgently needed to reduce dependence on imports and safeguard our foreign exchange.\n\nAttracting sufficient labour to the land will only be possible if rural housing and local amenities are quickly and effectively upgraded. Village life must be revitalised, and this task must be treated as a national priority."
STE_putting_food_on_the_tables: "Putting Food On the Tables"
STE_putting_food_on_the_tables_desc: "Though often underestimated, agriculture remains one of the most vital pillars of our nation's long-term development. The government is fully committed to the belief that Pomeranian agriculture and horticulture, once modernised and operating at full capacity, will become more important than ever in ensuring food security and contributing to the prosperity of urban centres.\n\nAn expanding and resilient domestic agricultural sector will not only stabilise food supply but will also unlock new markets for manufactured goods, particularly in the sectors of agricultural machinery, dairy equipment, and rural infrastructure. In doing so, agriculture can become the backbone of a sustainable and valuable export economy, driving innovation and national self-sufficiency well into the future."
STE_testing_the_limit: "Testing the Limit"
STE_testing_the_limit_desc: "The reality is that there is a limit to how much of their personal income citizens are willing to let the state claim, especially during peacetime. However, as economic pressures increase and state responsibilities grow, the government must consider raising taxes to maintain fiscal balance.\n\nThis necessary action will not come without consequences. The Hanseatic Guild, which has long been cautious about increased government interference in commerce and finance, has already expressed its dissatisfaction. Additional taxation could exacerbate this rift, potentially threatening the delicate alliance between the government and the trade sector."
STE_relief_for_earned_incomes: "Relief for Earned Incomes"
STE_relief_for_earned_incomes_desc: "The current system has significant flaws. It is overly complex and places a disproportionately heavy burden on those who exert extra effort. We therefore believe that serious consideration should be given to reducing the gaps between different tax levels and addressing the current imbalance, where overtime and additional income from extra work are taxed at a much higher rate than regular wages.\n\nAdditionally, we recommend raising the threshold below which personal savings are excluded from means testing. We should also work to expand the range of modest savings that are exempt from income tax altogether."
STE_infrastructural_woes: "Infrastructural Woes"
STE_infrastructural_woes_desc: "We will formally request assistance from the British government, specifically seeking the expertise of their specialists to help develop and modernize the road and rail infrastructure in West Pomerania. They have decades of experience in complex transport systems and post-crisis reconstruction; British engineers can provide valuable insights and practical solutions. This collaboration will accelerate our regional recovery, enhance internal connectivity, and integrate West Pomerania more effectively into the European transport network. It represents a pragmatic step toward rebuilding our country with resilience, efficiency, and international cooperation. Without a good rail network and core infrastructure, our country cannot function properly."
STE_transport_of_the_common_man: "Transport of the Common Man"
STE_transport_of_the_common_man_desc: "The government has acquired several older double-decker buses from the United Kingdom to replenish the municipal and intercity bus fleets, which were either destroyed or requisitioned during the intervention.\n\n Although these vehicles are not new, they provide a practical and cost-effective solution to address the current shortage in public transportation. Their introduction will help restore connectivity between towns and cities, relieve the burden on local commuters, and symbolize the gradual return to normalcy. This temporary measure is part of a larger strategy to rebuild critical infrastructure across the region and allow citizens to use public transportation freely."
STE_chokehold_on_the_order: "Chokehold on the Odra"
STE_chokehold_on_the_order_desc: "We now control the entrance to the trade route that spans the entire Oder River basin. This strategic position enables us to gain significant economic and logistical advantages.\n\n By managing the flow of goods through one of Central Europe's most important waterways, we are not only enhancing our economic standing but also gaining influence over regional trade dynamics. The state will ensure that the profits generated from this position are reinvested into infrastructure, port modernization, and social programs, so that all citizens, not just corporations, can benefit from the prosperity."
STE_partnerships_upstream: "Partnerships Upstream"
STE_partnerships_upstream_desc: "We are strategically positioned along a key trade corridor, and we are ready to sign trade agreements with interested states located along the Oder River and its tributaries.\n\n These agreements will enhance commerce for all involved parties by streamlining logistics, reducing barriers, and promoting regional interdependence. As the gateway to the Oder basin, we aim not only to achieve profits but also to take on a responsible leadership role in establishing a stable and cooperative economic zone. By fostering mutual benefits, we can strengthen both our neighbors and ourselves.\n\nFor prosperity!"

We have achieved a significant milestone; most people believe we are beginning to exceed the living standards of Poland before the collapse. Our work is not yet finished, as the rest of the country still awaits our liberation. However, for now, we have much to celebrate.

That is not a minor skirmish; it is a war that will test every resource, strategy, and soldier. We face critical shortages in equipment, insufficient training, and gaps in the command structure, leaving us dangerously exposed.

Only through control of the air can we guarantee the safety of our cities, the integrity of our supply lines, and the success of our operations on the ground and at sea.\n\nTo that end, we will invest in a modern air force capable of intercepting enemy bombers, supporting ground offensives, and projecting our strength beyond our borders. Fighter squadrons will shield our skies, while strike aircraft will soften enemy defences before our soldiers even arrive."

To achieve this, we will collaborate closely with the Hanseatic Guild to create a Dąbie Aerospace consortium.  Additionally, we will expand the Dąbie ground airport to enhance our infrastructure and support increased aerospace activities. This initiative will not only establish a robust aerospace sector in the region but also create high-skilled jobs, stimulate innovation, and boost the local economy. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive aerospace ecosystem that includes manufacturing, research and development, maintenance, and logistics."

Air superiority is not just an advantage; it is a strategic requirement. Our goal is to neutralize enemy air forces and destroy the industrial base that supports their warfighting capacity. By controlling the air, we can protect our troops, deny the enemy freedom of movement, and gain initiative across all areas of operation.\n\nThis vision will guide the development of our aerospace industry from the ground up, starting with Dąbie Aerospace and the expansion of the Dąbie ground airport, which will serve as the foundation of our future strength."

STE_the_gryphons_desc: "Our air force will execute precise and devastating attacks deep into enemy territory, similar to a gryphon striking with its claws. These strikes are designed to neutralize the enemy sources of strength: their industrial complexes and administrative command centres.\n\nThese operations will not be mere symbolic gestures. They will be deliberate and targeted, aimed at paralyzing the enemy war-making capacity, disrupting logistics, dismantling command structures, and eroding morale. By hitting the adversary at their core, we strive to shorten the conflict and force a collapse of their ability to sustain organized resistance."
STE_tacp_deployment: "TACP Deployment"
STE_tacp_deployment_desc: "Every unit within our ground forces will establish Tactical Air Control Parties (TACPs) that are embedded directly within their ranks. These specialized teams will be responsible for coordinating seamless, real-time cooperation between ground units and their air support assets.\n\nBy integrating TACPs at the unit level, we ensure that air support is precise, timely, and fully synchronized with ground manoeuvres. This close coordination will maximize the effectiveness of airstrikes, reconnaissance, and close air support missions, significantly enhancing operational flexibility and battlefield responsiveness.\n\nThe combined strength of our courageous soldiers on the ground and our fearless pilots in the air will create an unstoppable force. Together, they will establish a powerful synergy that dominates the battlefield, overwhelms the enemy, and secures decisive victories."
STE_the_missile_age: "The Missile Age"
STE_the_missile_age_desc: "Missiles represent the future of warfare, whether they are surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, air-to-surface, or air-to-air. They can strike deep into the territory of our adversaries while also protecting us from attempts to breach our airspace.\n\nWhat makes missile systems particularly valuable is their ability to deliver a decisive impact without directly putting our military personnel in danger. This capacity to engage the enemy from a distance, with precision and speed, makes missiles ideal for the complexities and demands of 21st-century warfare.\n\nBy investing in advanced missile technology and fully integrating it into our defence strategy, we can enhance our deterrence, increase operational flexibility, and maintain a strategic edge over potential threats."
STE_road_runways_of_pomerania: "Road Runways of Pomerania"
STE_road_runways_of_pomerania_desc: "n Western Pomerania, many road sections were originally designed as emergency airstrips. We can restore and adapt these for use by our Air Force.\n\nAlthough these airstrips may not be the most advanced or ideal facilities, they will be sufficient to meet our operational needs. By utilizing these existing infrastructures, we can quickly and cost-effectively expand our airbase network, enhancing our flexibility and resilience in aviation capabilities.\n\nRevitalizing these road airstrips will improve our strategic reach, provide better dispersal options for our aircraft, and strengthen our overall defence posture in the region."
STE_clean_slate: "Sense of Direction"
STE_clean_slate_desc: "There should be a place within our military system for nearly everyone who is not totally idle or utterly incompetent to serve. It is significant to ensure that we do not simply employ individuals who lack the necessary skills or dedication, for those who prove to be ineffective or incapable must be removed from service to maintain the effectiveness and discipline of the forces. However, the real challenge is to identify suitable roles for officers who may not be fit for higher command but still possess valuable experience and abilities. We kindly request discreet assistance from the British in rebuilding our army. Accordingly, we have been assigned Colonel Tom Blythe as both a military advisor and attaché to oversee and guide this vital process. "
STE_our_roots: "Our Roots"
STE_our_roots_desc: "The struggle against rival warlords does not resemble a conventional war, nor does it align with the rules and principles of traditional warfare for which modern European armies are trained. These conflicts are irregular, characterized by guerrilla tactics, shifting alliances, and unpredictable battlefields. Therefore, we must adhere to the methods that have already proven successful during the unification of the province. These tried-and-tested strategies are tailored to the unique challenges of regional power struggles and offer the best chance for victory. Relying solely on conventional military doctrine would be ineffective and could jeopardize the entire campaign. Our experience has shown that adaptability, local knowledge, and unconventional tactics are essential tools in this ongoing conflict."
STE_drawsko_rangers: "Drawsko Rangers"
STE_drawsko_rangers_desc: "Large swathes of northwestern Poland remain uninhabited, covered in dense forests and untamed terrain. Drawsko stands as a prime example of this wilderness, emote, rugged, and ideal for specialized training. Conveniently, it is also home to one of the largest military training grounds in Poland. It is there that we will establish a dedicated program to train specialists tasked with guiding our units through these treacherous landscapes. Mastery of this environment will be crucial, as success in such regions depends not only on strength and discipline but on intimate knowledge of the terrain, stealth, and adaptability."
STE_our_future: "Our Future"
STE_our_future_desc: "We must look to the future, specifically into our plans for the reconstruction of Poland. We must take the first step by grounding ourselves in the structures and doctrines of the former Polish Army. This foundation will not only provide a practical model for rebuilding our forces but also serve as a symbolic connection between our current efforts and the legacy of the Polish Republic. By doing this, we reaffirm our commitment to national unity, continuity and our readiness to face the challenges ahead. Poland awaits, and we ought to be ready."
STE_reform_the_12th_mechanized_brigade: "Re-form the 12th Mechanized Division"
STE_reform_the_12th_mechanized_brigade_desc: "e are in the process of reconstructing a conventional Polish military. Let's start with the 12th Mechanized Division, a unit of the Polish Armed Forces that was stationed in the Szczecin area. During the intervention, the division was caught off guard in Szczecin and fell apart, with only a few fragments managing to retreat deeper into Poland, where they fought bravely against the Germans, both on the frontlines and in partisan warfare. Some of the division's soldiers and officers became the foundation of the Griffin Guard. Their sacrifice will be significantly honoured."
STE_dispersed_manufacturing: "Drawsko Training Ground"
STE_dispersed_manufacturing_desc: "Borne Sulinowo, along with the nearby Drawsko training ground, is an ideal location for establishing a military institute focused on securing our technological advantage on the battlefield. The area's isolation, existing infrastructure, and military history make it well-suited for advanced research, experimentation, and training. This institute will serve as a centre for innovation, where we can develop new doctrines, test emerging technologies, and refine tactical approaches to address the unique challenges we encounter. In an era where success is often determined by information, mobility, and precision, maintaining a technological edge will be crucial for the long-term strategic success of the Pomeranian military."
STE_borne_sulinowo_compound: "War of Peoples and Causes"
STE_borne_sulinowo_compound_desc: "This is no war of chieftains or of princes, of dynasties or national ambition; it is a war of peoples and of causes. There are vast numbers, not only in this land but in every land, who will render faithful service in this war but whose names will never be known, whose deeds will never be recorded. This is a War of the Unknown Warrior, but let all strive without failing in faith or in duty, and the dark curse of the collapse will be lifted from our age. Poland will rise!"
STE_call_of_the_sea: "Rule the Waves"
STE_call_of_the_sea_desc: "As one of only two voivodeships with unrestricted access to the Baltic Sea, we hold a rare and vital advantage - one that we cannot waste. That is our moment to reclaim our maritime legacy and build a fleet worthy of a true successor to the Polish state. The sea is not just a border; it is a lifeline, a route to trade, influence, and military reach.\n\nA powerful navy will serve as both shield and spear: protecting our coastline, securing vital shipping lanes, and projecting our strength across the Baltic region. Shipyards must be revived or constructed anew, naval academies established, and a proud officer corps trained to command our mighty naval forces."
STE_restore_captured_warships: "Gigantic Castles of Steel..."
STE_restore_captured_warships_desc: "Most warlords focus on building vessels designed only for rivers and inland waterways because that is all they have access to. However, we must think bigger and look beyond the immediate. Our vision should extend farther than theirs. We will construct ships capable of operating not only along rivers but also on the open sea, vessels with the range, durability, and strength to navigate the Baltic Sea with ease.\n\nThis ambition goes beyond mere transport or defence; it is about our long-term goals. While others are limited to inland skirmishes, we will command the coastlines. Where others build small boats, we will develop a proper navy."
STE_dabie_lake_submarine_tests: "Dąbie Lake Submarine Tests"
STE_dabie_lake_submarine_tests_desc: "In the calm, sheltered waters of Lake Dąbie and the Szczecin Lagoon, we will begin the vital task of testing and refining our submarine fleet. These inland seas provide the ideal conditions for experimentation, training, and innovation, away from foreign surveillance and interference. It is here that the silent backbone of our future navy will be forged.\n\nSubmarines are not mere weapons of stealth. With them, we can deny enemy fleets freedom of movement, sever supply lines, and strike from the depths with devastating precision. As the first step in building a true naval power, our submarine program will ensure that Western Pomerania does not merely defend its coast - it controls the sea beyond it."
STE_all_the_aces: "...Wending their Way Across the Misty Sea"
STE_all_the_aces_desc: "The rivers may belong to warlords, but the sea will belong to us. With each keel laid and each hull launched, Western Pomerania rises, not only as a power on land but also as a force that will command the Baltic Sea. Our shipyards will be filled with purpose, our harbours will teem with steel and sailors, and our flag will fly over every corner of these cold northern waters. While others may dream of the coast, we will rule it. Let it be known that Western Pomerania is destined to dominate the waves!"
STE_formoza_training_facility: "Fight Them on the Beaches"
STE_formoza_training_facility_desc: "Our navy must be supported by a well-trained marine infantry, ready to assist our ground forces at a moment's notice. With a capable and indomitable fleet behind us, we will have the ability to strike swiftly and decisively on any coastline at any time.\n\nThese elite marines will be more than just soldiers; they will serve as the spearhead of our amphibious power, mastering both the sea and the shore. Whether securing vital ports, launching assaults behind enemy lines, or holding strategic islands, they will embody the reach and flexibility of a maritime army."
STE_the_hun_at_our_throat: "The Hun At Our Throat"
STE_the_hun_at_our_throat_desc: "Unless Germany is beaten in a manner which leaves no room for doubt or dispute unless she is convinced by the terrible logic of events that the glory of her people can never be achieved by violent means, unless her war-making capacity is sensibly diminished, a renewal of the conflict seems unavoidable. History has shown that partial measures and ambiguous outcomes only sow the seeds for future aggression. If Germany is allowed to interpret defeat as temporary or incomplete, the ideology that fuels militarism and conquest will persist beneath the surface, ready to erupt once more. Only a decisive, unmistakable outcome, militarily, politically, and morally, can guarantee lasting peace."
STE_the_forges_roar: "The Forges Roar"
STE_the_forges_roar_desc: "To meet the tremendous demands of the battles that lie ahead, we must focus on the concentrated and highly efficient production of weapons and ammunition. Our survival and success will rely not only on strategy and bravery but also on our ability to equip our forces promptly and without interruption. We will either repurpose vast industrial complexes or construct new ones, operating around the clock to produce the tools of war. From rifles to artillery shells, from armoured components to fuel reserves, every element must be manufactured with relentless precision. That will require a complete mobilization of our industrial base, unprecedented coordination of logistics, and a dedicated labour force committed to achieving national victory."
STE_the_hammers_descend: "The Hammers Descend"
STE_the_hammers_descend_desc: "Concentrating our industrial capacity in just a few critical locations would be a grave mistake; it would create an ideal target for enemies, both external and internal. Instead, our factories will be organized as decentralized complexes spread throughout the entire province. This distributed model will make our war production more resilient and far less vulnerable to sabotage. Should one facility fall or be destroyed, the impact on the overall war effort will be minimal and easily absorbed by the rest. In this way, we ensure continuity of supply, operational flexibility, and strategic durability in the face of any threat."
STE_never_forget: "Never Forget"
STE_never_forget_desc: "Germany's intervention shattered Poland, breaking it into a million pieces. One cannot help but wonder whether, without foreign interference, the Polish people might have found their way to overcome the authoritarian PiS regime. That opportunity was stolen from us, our future taken, our sovereignty undermined. Once again, we were thrown backwards by those who claimed to act in the name of order and stability. We will not allow this to happen again.\n\nWe will never forget what was done to us. Germany will always be considered our enemy, and eventually, they will face consequences for their actions."
STE_rig_the_bridges_on_the_odra: "Rig the Bridges on the Odra"
STE_rig_the_bridges_on_the_odra_desc: "All bridges spanning the Oder River, key points of access from Germany into West Pomerania, will be thoroughly prepared for immediate demolition should there be any indication of hostile movement from the German side. These vital crossings, which once symbolized connection and commerce, must now serve a different purpose: defence and deterrence.\n\nWe cannot afford to be caught off guard again. Strategic explosives and engineering teams will be stationed and ready, ensuring that the bridges can be neutralized at a moment's notice to halt any advancing force. Szczecin has suffered significantly in the past. It has too often been the first to fall, the first to bleed. This time, we are prepared."
STE_the_dobieszczyn_kolbaskowo_front: "Dobieszczyn - Kołbaskowo Front"
STE_the_dobieszczyn_kolbaskowo_front_desc: "Szczecin is located very close to the German border, with its central area on the left bank of the Odra, unlike the rest of Poland, which is separated from Germany by the river. This proximity creates a unique vulnerability that we must address. It is crucial to fortify the border urgently, effectively sealing it off as much as possible. By constructing an extensive network of bunkers, we can prevent any German incursions.\n\nOur defences must be strong and impenetrable, as the safety of Szczecin and the entire region relies on it."
STE_the_hun_within: "The Hun Within"
STE_the_hun_within_desc: "An external German threat no longer intimidates us, but what about the enemy within our borders? Subversive elements from Germany have tried to take root in Szczecin, undermining our unity and sowing discord. We will uproot them completely, like weeds threatening the health of our nation. To achieve this, we will establish a dedicated intelligence agency tasked with identifying, monitoring, and swiftly removing these unwanted elements.\n\nIn the name of the Republic, we vow to protect our homeland from all internal threats. Our vigilance will ensure that no foreign or domestic force can weaken the spirit or sovereignty of Pomerania. We stand united and ready to defend what is rightfully ours."
STE_direct_control_from_the_spinach_palace: "Direct Control from the Spinach Palace"
STE_direct_control_from_the_spinach_palace_desc: "To commemorate the successful military reform, a new national holiday will be established on the anniversary of its founding - Victory Day.\n\nCitizens can look forward to vibrant festivals and a wide range of attractions throughout the day. However, the centrepiece of the celebrations will be impressive displays of military equipment and a grand military parade along the Wały Chrobrego promenade. That spectacular event will feature the coordinated participation of the land forces, air force, and naval units, showcasing the strength and unity of our armed forces.\n\nVictory Day will serve not only as a celebration of our military achievements but also as a symbol of national pride, resilience, and the dedication of those who protect our country."

### Koronacja 
STE_delusions_of_grandeur: "Delusions of Grandeur"
STE_delusions_of_grandeur_desc: "What the fuck? What the hell? In a stunning and utterly unexpected move, President Piotr Krzystek has announced his intention to crown himself King of Pomerania. The nation was left in collective disbelief. We admire him. We respect him. But... a king? Is he insane? The announcement, broadcast live on state television, sent shockwaves across the region. After more than a hundred years, the monarchy is set to return to the lands of Pomerania, not under the banner of the Hohenzollerns, but under the house... of Krzystek?\n\nThe president, now, perhaps, the self-declared monarch, stood before the nation with regal confidence. But as the news spread, the question lingered in every household, every café, every street corner:\n\n§RHas he lost his mind?"
STE_at_the_helm: "At the Helm"
STE_at_the_helm_desc: "The time had finally arrived for all of Pomerania to unite under a single banner. After years of struggle, negotiation, and sacrifice, Piotr Krzystek's government could proudly announce that the region had been fully secured. What once seemed like a distant dream now had become a reality. Town by town, border by border, the people of Pomerania had chosen unity over division and hope over fear. Now, the path ahead points toward the unification of the whole nation. Without a doubt, we stand as a strong and rightful contender to carry forward the enduring legacy of the Polish Republic."
STE_the_kings_new_clothes: "King's New Clothes"
STE_the_kings_new_clothes_desc: "A monarch worthy of a serious nation must be adorned in garments befitting his station. While President Piotr Krzystek has long commanded respect in his finest suits, even the sharpest modern attire cannot match the grandeur and symbolism of true royal regalia. That is why, from this day forward, it shall be our highest priority to commission the finest tailor in the region, if necessary, from beyond our borders, even across all of Europe, to craft a royal ensemble worthy of our new King. The dignity of the crown demands nothing less than magnificence."
STE_the_right_man_for_the_job: "Right Man For the Job"
STE_the_right_man_for_the_job_desc: "he population isn't exactly... convinced by Krzystek's plan. However, with a carefully measured dose of strategic messaging and patriotic narrative, they may come to recognize the leadership qualities of our future king.\n\nThough scepticism lingers in the hearts of many, history has shown that strong leadership often faces resistance before acceptance. With the proper storytelling, the people may begin to see not just a politician but a sovereign in the making.\n\nThrough well-crafted speeches, cultural campaigns, and a renewed emphasis on national identity, we can shift public perception. After all, kings are not born in palaces - they are being forged in the crucible of history, and Krzystek, whether they see it yet or not, is already standing on the threshold of a throne shaped by his own will."
STE_royal_jewels: "Royal Jewels"
STE_royal_jewels_desc: "No monarchy is complete without a crown, which serves as a symbol of authority, unity, and tradition. Piotr Krzystek reflects on his choices, fully aware that selecting this exceptional crown carries significance not only for himself but for all of Pomerania. The crown must embody the strength, dignity, and history of a nation standing on the brink of a new era. Should he commission a new crown for himself, or should he reuse the one that belonged to the Pomeranian Griffins? That is a difficult decision for him to make."
STE_home_of_the_griffins: "Home of the Griffins"
STE_home_of_the_griffins_desc: "Every monarchy requires a residence worthy of its dignity, a place that reflects both the majesty of rule and the continuity of national history. In this regard, the Ducal Castle of the Pomeranian Princes emerges as the most fitting choice. Located in the heart of Szczecin and steeped in centuries of tradition, the castle once served as the seat of the ancient dukes of Pomerania.\n\n It is within these storied halls that Piotr Krzystek, the future King of a united Pomerania, will establish his residence. This move marks not only a symbolic return of monarchy to its historical roots but also a reimagining of royal authority for the 21st century."
STE_greasing_holy_hands: "Greasing Holy Hands"
STE_greasing_holy_hands_desc: "St. James Cathedral in Szczecin, once the proud spiritual heart of the region, suffered significant damage during the intervention and the subsequent uprising. For years, the scars on its ancient walls remained largely unrepaired due to a lack of funds, leaving the historic monument in a state of quiet decay - a sombre reminder of turbulent times.\n\nNow, as a new era of the kingdom begins, there is a determined effort to restore this symbol of our heritage. Krzystek has successfully secured the necessary funding for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Rumour has it that this support came with a condition: in exchange for financing the repairs, the Bishop of Szczecin has agreed to preside over Krzystek's upcoming coronation ceremony."
STE_the_grand_coronation: "The Grand Coronation"
STE_the_grand_coronation_desc: "All key figures from the government and aristocracy have gathered within the imposing, centuries-old walls of the Castle of the Pomeranian Princes. Diplomats, nobles, military leaders, and dignitaries from across the region have come together under one roof, their faces reflecting a mixture of anticipation, curiosity, and cautious hope. The weight of history presses upon them all as they prepare to witness an event destined to alter the course of Pomerania forever. Within these walls, the future of a nation hangs in the balance, and every eye is focused on the man who will soon step forward to claim his place in history. Yet, even those with doubts proudly shout:\n\n§RLong live the King!"

unification.74.desc: "In West Pomerania, the Polish state never truly died. Initially in hiding, the Griffon Guard reclaimed the regional capital during the German retreat, and then marched forward, falling one warlord after another in an unholy alliance with the Hanseatic Guild - a league of 3 corporations holding unprecedented power within the West Pomeranian economy. The young Republic now faces its greatest test, with a worsening economic and social situation combined with the upcoming parliamentary election. For the continued survival of the republic, the currently loose authority of the central government over the monopolistic corporations will have to be greatly strengthened, or else conflicting interests will tear the fledgling state apart before it could even truly get off the ground."

szczecin.1.t: "Promised Land"
szczecin.1.desc: "He slept, as he had no more strength to weep over his sorrow state. Although his dreams were blank, dark canvases for thoughts that couldn't form, he found serenity in them. For the first time in years, he was free. At least for as long as he could dream. Feeling nothing of his poor and dirty body, he has throw aside all known limits of his consciousness. He swam through the dark canvases. He visited the memories of his old home at Kościuszki st. He climbed on the old cornices of tenement houses, and then he jumped. He knew that the empty, concrete street below wouldn't stop him from flying further into the dream. Into the never-ending space, pulsing with colours to the rhythm of his weak heart. At the end of it he hid in his room of confidence and safety. It was a literal imaginary room he often conjured up in his short sleep breaks. It helped him to hide form the cruel world since his middle school. Every time something bad happened, he went back to his home and hid his head into pillows, as if into proverbial sand. He was really good at daydreaming... but not this time.\n\nAnd then the sound screamed into his ears. It was a terrible, loud and silly jingle from his television he fell asleep in front of. Janusz opened his sore eyes, slowly but intensively feeling the increasing headache he was sentenced to. And sentenced he was rightfully, for his excessive alcohol consumption. His throat scratched without mercy, and the barely visible bottle of Paulaner still clenched in his hand appeared to be completely emptied. Just as the legion of similar ones, standing proudly around the old sofa Janusz was laid on, more like a dead body than an employee of the month. But still, even in his sorry state, he still was exactly that: recently named the best of the SEC's boiler stokers in Stettin. He had God given right to celebrate, as one of the few still valued poles in this once again german city. At least that's how it was in his mind. They might not pay him with the extra money he wants, but the shopping vouchers they threw at him, he eagerly spent to the last. Good thing the shop he used them at was not too picky on what exactly he could buy, or how much alcohol it had. He felt happy, or at least he wanted to. He needed a break though. His old body couldn't take another bottle of ambrosia, so all that was left was to just sit, wait, and watch the loud television in front of him. The sound and light from the Deutsche Welle programme filled his darkened room. And behind the flatscreen TV, there he was:\n\n"...indeed, your worries are over. As your appointed governor, I will continue to take care of the economic growth and integration of the city." - Christian Lindner spoke proudly. Janusz listened to the voice, whose haughty tone he already had time to get used to.\n"I promise you that from now on, this land and its people will only have good times ahead of them. There is much to be happy about..."\n\nUnfortunately, the next day the man was fired from his work. Had to make a place for someone younger and more able than him..."
szczecin.1.a: "Gott sei dank. Verdammt, das ist echt geil."

szczecin.2.t: "Rude Interruption"
szczecin.2.desc: "A sunny day in Stettin. It was a perfect day to lay back and appreciate the civilizing aspect of the European peacekeeping mission. Unfortunately for Helmuth and his squadmates from the antiterrorist tactical unit, it was the day to answer the call of duty. A secret informant leaked information about a partisan hideout.\n - Ungrateful Poles - Helmuth thought to himself. Once again their pitiful Rzeczpospolita turned out to be a Saisonstaat and instead of being thankful for the professional and quick German help, they rebel against our benevolent administration.\n\n His team approached a position in Kreckow at the edges of Stettin. As was established by their intel, the suspects were hiding in the old World War 2 bunkers. As always Poles preferred nostalgia and pathos instead of functionality and discretion.  Each soldier assumed his position ensuring no traitor could escape or mount a successful counterattack. The commander gave a sign for Helmuth to approach the rebel base to estimate the danger. Quiet like a leopard, Helmut moved closer to the bunker's timeworn brick walls.\n'Strike the German!' 'Drive Fritzes away!' 'Shoot!' 'Shoot'!\nYoung policeman couldn't understand all the words being said. Nevertheless, he came to the frightening conclusion that the Poles in the bunker were ready to execute an innocent captured German settler. In a matter of milliseconds, he gave the signal to the captain, who in turn authorized another member of the strike team to use gas grenades. \n - Get down on the ground! - the antiterrorists shouted in Polish once the grenades went off, throwing the suspects on the paved .\nFour men and one woman were apprehended. The base contained some sort of communication equipment with an independent energy source and a stash of Molotov cocktails. At least that could be determined with all this smoke around.\n What's weird, the criminals' victim was nowhere to be found. Come to think of it the terrorists weren't wearing any military gear or uniforms and they didn't seem to be in physical shape to live the demanding life of guerilla fighters. The dispersing of gas finally allowed policemen to realize what really happened. The communication equipment turned out to be self-repaired TV. The stash of Molotovs was in fact an enormous pile of bottles of moonshine. Helmuth, still cautious, approached the screen with his machine gun ready to fire. It turned out the Poles were just watching an archival Polish vs Germany match from 2014.\n - It's a drinking den. Not a rebel base. - the fresh recruit finally stated the obvious.\nNot long after one of the apprehended, free from the initial shock, began to explain the misunderstanding. Probably. Alcohol and burning rage made the rustling Polish language even more uncomprehensible.\n - We could still arrest them, sir. - Helmuth tried to salvage the situation. - Given the reports of rising Brzęczek partisan group deep in Poland, we could still file this under seditious activity.\n - No use - commander replied with a sigh - They're innocent. That'd only antagonize the Poles. Gentlemen, we're done here. Time to have a talk with guys from counter-intelligence."

szczecin.3.t: "Our Underworld"
szczecin.3.desc: "Jacek's heart raced like a car on a racetrack. That wasn't how it was supposed to be - he thought - as he fought through the dense Arkonian forest. The quick partisan action turned out to be a bloodbath. He heard the German soldiers catching up to him. He was scared. A few years before, he was an ordinary high school student with dreams, perspectives, and a bright future. When the collapse of Poland began, his stability was gone. After the unfortunate death of his parents during the German invasion, he was vengeful. Being a partisan eased up his pain.\n\nStill, after all, he was never ready for that. Their job primarily involved vandalizing government buildings and putting anti-Lidner posters within the city, which was substantially easy for them. He could potentially spend a few days in prison at most. He couldn't even imagine that they would shoot. Suddenly, he stumbled over an exposed tree root and fell. Jacek didn't know it was already over for him. When he got up and tried to overrun his tormentors, a bullet pierced his leg. \n\nHe let out a silent cry as he fell again. An unbearable pain spread throughout Jacek's entire body. As he endured this agony, his happiest memories flashed before his eyes. Beloved Kasia, vacations in Kołobrzeg with the long-gone parents, wandering through the streets of Szczecin with his classmates - it all seemed like a fever dream. Orders shouted by the captain of the approaching soldiers felt like a different realm. \n\nThe reality struck when a brutal German delivered a swift kick to his stomach. Jacek cought violently. And what do we have here? - the soldier spoke with arrogance combined with curiosity - another Polish scum?\nSoldiers cornered the young partisan from every side.\n\nLet me handle this, Hans. The uncompromising voice spoke from behind as it quickly advanced to the scene. The German officer crouched before Jacek and looked directly into his eyes.\nHello, young boy. What is your name?\nJacek, sir - as he replied, his voice cracked in fear\nI'm Colonel Helmuth Bluthgeld. I will be clear: your life depends entirely on your honesty with me in the coming moments.\nPlease tell me where your main base is, and I will let you go free. As simple as that - he smiled.\nI dunno, sir; they never provided me with all the details.\n\nBluthgeld glanced at his band as if giving them a silent command.\n No, no, please! - Jacek cried in despair. There is a house in Warszewo, on Urlopowa Street, where we all used to meet. I beg you not to kill me.\n\nThe colonel pretended to let out a slight sigh of relief.\n\nAs promised, I will set you free.\n\nIt was mere seconds when Helmuth reached for his gun. Jacek barely realized what was happening. Shot rang through the vast forest. Another innocent life has been lost, joining the many others who have suffered the same fate."

szczecin.4.t: "Ausweiss Bitte"
szczecin.4.desc: "Major Andrzej Biedrzycki was furious when the German garrison at Hansa Brücke detained him for several hours. Although he had all the documents necessary for passage they held him back, likely out of malice towards one of the few high-ranking Poles remaining in the Szczecin military command. They also made sure he felt like a lesser individual, sitting on a painfully uncomfortable stool in a dimly lit interrogation room.\n\nHe was just coming back from his \"work trip\" to the city's eastern bank. Officially collecting orders from the Eurokommissariat Westpolen's Military HQ, the true nature of his visit was a meeting with General Szymon Koziatek, who, like many other Poles still serving the EKW's machine, was disappointed with Tusk's regime. It became evident from the information he gathered that European rule in Szczecin was, indeed, coming to an end. Soon, the German garrison would retreat to Berlin, leaving the citizens of Szczecin a chance to reclaim their city. Biedrzycki's primary and most important role was to inform the Griffin Guard about this impending chance for revolution.\n\nAndrzej was not a revolutionary. Once news of the German intervention hit, he believed Szczecin would eventually return to Polish rule through gradual, evolutionary changes. However, he was mistaken - the germans gutted the Polish administration, made them second-class citizens in their own city. And the reports he read about Helmuth's Bluthgeld anti-guerilla operations? The senseless cruelty inflicted upon his people struck him deeply. That is why he contacted the Griffin Guard; to atone for his sins.\n\nThe inspection lasted for over an hour. Biedrzycki was seething with anger on the inside, but he kept his calm demeanor in the name of the mission. Hopefully this was the last time he had to endure such treatment. When they finally allowed Andrzej to pass, he just smirked, entered his military G-Wagon, and drove towards the west bank.\n\nSzczecin was not the city he had known throughout his life anymore. Even if the war had not significantly impacted it, the problem lay in the atmosphere. Life in the city felt uneasy - wealthy Germans occupied the homes once belonging to Polish elites, and foreign troops watched every corner. Living in Szczecin felt like sitting on a powder keg, ready to explode at any moment. Closing in on the designated meeting spot, his heart was pounding wildly - afraid of being followed, the major checked every car mirror at least a dozen times before making the final turn.\n\nHe entered the seemingly abandoned house in the Gumieńce district. There, sitting on a dilapidated couch, his handler greeted him. After confirming their loyalties to the cause with a simple code phrase, Biedrzycki passed along the necessary information about the German retreat. Then both men simply nodded and hurriedly left the house.\n\nWhen he drove to the station, he knew."

szczecin.5.t: "Sehr geehrter Herr Lindner..."
szczecin.5.desc: "Sitting idly in his office, Christian Lindner felt like a ruin of a man. Slouched, hands on his temples, breath anxiously quickened, and with a nervous tremor in his right leg that simply refused to go away no matter how hard he tried to still himself. By midday, the Eurogoverneur was on his fourth cup of double-brewed black coffee, not that he needed it to stay alert as the persistent feeling of impending doom did more than enough to keep him awake both during the day and especially at night. He could tell his regime was on its last legs, and yet, all he could see around him was apathy. Indifference. Despite the constant protests, despite armed insurgents openly chanting for his deposition, it seemed like nobody even cared enough to intervene on his behalf. The Fatherland failing him yet again was no surprise, though it did sting what little remained of Lindner's patriotic pride. No, it was his supposed 'partners' sitting by that irked him. They stood just as much to lose and still chose to leave him to do all the work? And now, despite repeated prods and pleas, they just... ignored him? Why would they not even have the courtesy to say ANYTHING?\n\nWhatever the reason may have been, the elegantly styled letter lying in front of Lindner was bound to provide at least some answers. Admiring its sleek design, defaced only by a single crease along one of its corners, the exhausted politician handled the note with utmost care despite his visible unsteadiness, feeling almost guilty as he broke its pristine trident seal. After a deep breath, he began to read the contents.\n\nSehr geehrter Herr Lindner,\n\nWe hope this letter finds You well. Though we express our utmost sympathy for You and Your precarious position, we must regretfully inform You that the recent increases in instability have forced us to temporarily suspend our current partnership and unilaterally void any and all arrangements, whether signed or verbal, with the Freistadt's administration. Should the situation permit it, we remain open to restoring our present ties at a more opportune time. Until then, we kindly ask You to refrain from attempting any contact with our organization or any of its individual members. Our representatives will reach out once we are ready to re-enter negotiations.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, listed below are the contracts that will no longer be in effect as of...\n\nUnwilling to read through the numerous blows dealt to his administration by the Hansa's proclamation, Lindner, overcome with anger at their brazen betrayal, chose to resort to the harshest outburst he could muster in his resigned state. Using all his force, he crumpled the letter, setting aside all concerns about its aesthetic qualities, and threw it carelessly towards the nearest trashcan. As the paper bounced off the metal rim and fell on the ground, the official stared at the unbearable disorder it brought to his otherwise orderly workspace, stood up with a sigh, and dropped it neatly where it belonged before sinking back into his chair, defeated."

szczecin.6.t: "Scold the Companies"
szczecin.6.desc: "Christian Lindner had grown tired of the Hanseatic Guild. His country was on the brink of collapse, and the Guild's support was minimal and filled with meaningless rhetoric. For heaven's sake, the Germans were soon going to abandon him, and the only forces capable of halting the city's decline were those three powerful corporations. As he paced in his office, moving from one corner to another, he contemplated a potential solution to this grave situation. After much deliberation, he decided to draft a strong letter. In his mind, this was the only way to compel them to take action.\n\nBefore getting started, he took a quick walk through City Hall. The news of the impending evacuation had spread rapidly, and many employees were already packing and sealing critical documents. It seemed that nobody believed in his victory. He wanted to proclaim that he would win, that he would prove those buffoons from Berlin wrong and secure the city with or without their support. However, deep down, he knew it was just a fever dream and that his impending doom was close at hand.\n\nUpon returning to his expansive headquarters, he poured himself a whisky. The letter he was about to write would significantly impact his future, and he was determined to craft it as well as possible. The first few sentences came slowly, but soon a flood of words began to flow.\n\nLiebe Mitglieder der Hanse,\n\nOur cooperation has significantly shaped Szczecin into what it is today. The combined strength of the government and the Guild has been more than just a necessary partnership. So why change that now? Why have you chosen to betray me and the German people? I have provided you with the influence, resources, and opportunities to thrive in my city. And this is how you repay me? By ignoring the needs of the state and its population? The Free City of Stettin is collapsing, and you are essentially doing nothing to prevent it from happening. I am deeply disappointed with your actions. Nonetheless, I still remember what you have done for the city. That is your last chance to rethink and reconsider your decisions. I expect your support in the coming days. I assure you that our partnership can bring you significant benefits if you follow very straightforward rules.\n\nFor the sake of clarity and understanding, I have listed them for you in a convenient way...\n\nCrafting a proper letter took him hours, but after numerous revisions, it was finally complete. Lindner felt a sense of fatigue mixed with satisfaction. He had always been seen as calm and submissive, but now he had shown his true strength. He was not weak. Regardless of whether his efforts to fix the city succeeded or failed, he would not back down. It was time to take decisive action to resolve this situation. Christian would certainly make his German colleagues envious, or die with this failed experiment."

szczecin.7.desc: "In the city centre of Szczecin, just like any other day, punctually at 7 am, a small establishment came to life. "Bar Pasztecik" is a small family-owned restaurant, started in the 1960s. People from far parts of the city and beyond have been coming here to get their high-quality deep-fried snacks for decades. Today was just like any other day, when the current owner of the store folded the armoured curtains and opened the doors widely. The tiny store has seen strife and crises since its establishment, but it stood throughout them proudly, with the recent collapse not being something out of the ordinary. After all, people've gotta eat, as grandpa always said - the owner thought to himself.\n\nStanding outside, his sight was caught by an elderly lady in a red dress and a fuzzy coat, approaching his store with her pommeranian at her side. The sounds of heels and high-pitched barks rang around the empty street covered with a morning haze. \n "Madame Bernadeta, good morning, what a pleasure to see you." - the owner exclaimed, bowing his head before the lady. \n "Gentleman like his father, good morning, Mr. Witold." - she responded while nodding gracefully, her gray locks bobbing softly. \n "I have already prepared your daily order as requested, Madame, and I made sure to pack a little extra for tiny Reksio." Witold smiled warmly and beckoned the lady inside, to which she obliged. \n "People are talking, Mr. Witold, that the new government is taking over small food businesses just like yours, to feed the masses," she whispered. \n "Madame, our little establishment weathered communism and the collapse, we'll survive this too." - With a forced smile, he answered while handing over a paper bag with the goods, alongside a cup with hot borscht. "This time it's on the house, Madame, thank you for your continued support." \n "God bless you, young man." - She gave him a reassuring smile, then left the store, leaving a strong scent of perfume behind her. \n \n Suddenly, a familiar van arrived in front of the store, but instead of jolly Mr. Tadek from the local bakery, it was a troop of armed police officers, heading inside the store, with a man in a black suit leading them, and a small group of engineers in reserve, arriving in a second van. \n "What can I help you with, gentlemen?" - the store owner spoke in an innocent, maybe even naive tone. \n "By the order declared by the city council, we are here to requisition any food and food production supplies, and you're obliged by law to comply." - the man in the suit spoke with a cold, calculated manner while putting a crudely printed out warrant with the city's stamp at the bottom. \n "No, no no no no no no..." - Witold started to plead. "Wait wait wait wait wait!". \n His cries were for naught, however, as the officers in the blink of an eye emptied his store of anything edible, and the engineers disassembled the 60-year-old pasztecik machine."

Blue and white banners still fluttered beside old slogans about sovereignty and discipline, though their color seemed a little more faded now.\nHe addressed the gathering with the fervor of a man who still believed in his own words. He promised to protect Polish tradition, not as some distant ideal, but as a living truth. A truth found in daily bread, spoken in the language of grandparents, held in the bond between neighbors and the dignity of honest work.\n-This,- he said, sweeping his hand across the crowd, -is Poland. Not the one in reports written in Brussels. Not the one advertised on TV between German soap and American detergent. Our Poland. The one built with calloused hands and carried in prayer.-\nHe spoke of horse-drawn carts on cobbled roads. Of village chapels where the bells still rang. Of harvests celebrated in the same fields worked by generations. A Poland for Poles.\nThen came the questions.\nThe atmosphere shifted. The applause thinned. Faces once hopeful now looked strained. Mothers clutched toddlers by the hand. Elderly men leaned on worn walking sticks. Shopkeepers stood with folded arms.\nThey didn't want poetry anymore.\nAn older woman stepped forward. Her face was red from sun and worry. Her voice cut through the stillness.-What are you going to do, Mr. Bogucki, when we can't feed our families?-\nShe spoke plainly. The fields were dry from drought. Then came the storms. Fertilizer was too expensive. Prices had to go up just to survive, but no one in the towns was buying. Or worse, it was Hansa, specifically Netto, that bought it all. At prices so low it didn't even cover the cost of seed.\nShe looked him straight in the eye.\n-What are you going to do when no one's left to sow the fields? When our children go to school in shoes with holes, when old people skip dinner, and the men end up at the bottle because it's the only thing left that's cheap?-\nBogucki adjusted his jacket. He swallowed. The crowd was silent now.\nNo longer a proud nation in miniature. Just hungry, exhausted people waiting."

The coffers with valuables were too heavy to effectively transport them during their retreat on the few remaining ships.\nHe couldn't hide his amusement. Krzystek answered with an encouraging smile.\n - You're dismissed.\n\nHaving been left alone, Krzystek sat in the most comfortable pose he could achieve in his office. Things were better than expected. He never thought they would retrieve loot taken by the Danes. Already, his mind painted the prospects of developing Szczecin with the additional funds concentrated in his hands. Of course, after the president rewards himself for the way his impeccable rule enabled such a superb execution of this military operation that retrieved the people's money back to Szczecin...\n- Oh, right. The people - Krzystek brought himself down to earth.\nHe could hide the fact that those stolen goods belonged to his citizens. And the fact Danegeld functioned more or less like a tax and extensive documentation showed who lost what and now everybody could easily issue a claim to the jewelry or money we retrieved.\n - Perhaps, I could hide the fact we retrieved the valuables. - Not that he was against giving people their rightful possessions. Krzystek just wanted to explore all the angles of the situation. - No, too dangerous.\nThe people would be disappointed that the recent war gave them nothing. And hiding such treasure would involve black market shenanigans and that could be quickly uncovered by the press, either independently or with the help of...\n - The Guild - The companies would surely want a piece of that cake for their 'noble' help in overthrowing the German occupation.

szczecin.10.desc: "To Jerzy Nowacki, the city never felt real. Not truly. Not since Max Kolonko arrived on his glossy ships and told the people that Koszalin would become the "New Washington of the Baltic." That was months ago - when the city still had water in its fountains, electricity in its streetlights, and illusions in the air and German occupational forces.\n\nJerzy had believed in it, once. Everyone did. The American flags. The blue-uniformed guards with their plastic smiles. The nightly "Telling It Like It Is" broadcast, where Kolonko, with his accent and perfect lighting, promised progress, burgers, Hollywood deals, and a bright future that glowed red, white, and blue. People laughed, sang, and cheered, even as their stomachs hollowed and the blackout hours grew longer.\n\nBut over time, the shimmer turned to static. Roads cracked. Imports dried up. Journalists vanished. Books were burned. The billboards said "Patriotic Revolution", but the eyes of the men guarding them said otherwise. And so did the screams from the back of the police vans.\n\nStill, people waited. Hoped. Maybe the Americans really would return. Maybe the next convoy of aid would bring medicine. Food. A miracle.\nInstead, it brought tanks from Szczecin.\n\nWhen the shelling began in the outskirts, Jerzy was in the basement with his wife and daughter. He remembers the concrete shaking. The sound of boots. The distant pop-pop of gunfire. But it was over quickly. Quicker than anyone expected. The "American Guards" ran. Some surrendered. Some tried to blend into the crowd. Others died with their rifles still slung across their backs, too stunned to react.\n\nSzczecin's army decisively won a crucial battle on the outskirts of the city. After the collapse of Kolonko's guards, their forces scattered in disarray. They were losing ground rapidly, withdrawing minute by minute. Seizing the momentum, Szczecin's army advanced, reclaiming the city district by district. Government buildings were set ablaze, one after another, as symbols of the old regime fell.\n\nAs dawn broke, smoke trailed into the sky from the former city council, which was turned into Kolonko's palace. It was burning. A crowd had gathered. They said he fled the night before, disguised as a priest. Others said he was shot trying to escape on a stolen UN helicopter. No one truly knew. But in his place, a soldier from Szczecin stood on a pile of rubble and declared the city "liberated."\nLiberated.\nThe word hung heavy in the air.\n\nSome wept. Others clapped half-heartedly. Most just stood there, eyes dull from years of false promises and demise. Jerzy looked at the faces around him. They were workers. Widows. Former believers. Prisoners of a dream that turned to ash.\n\nAnd as the red-blue banner of the Provisional Government replaced the stars and stripes over the administrative centre, Jerzy felt only exhaustion.\n\nKoszalin had burned - not just the buildings, but the idea it had tried to become. The parody of democracy. The imported dream. The city had never really belonged to them until now.\n\nNow it was just Koszalin again. And maybe, that was enough. "

He believed that Pomerania rightfully belonged to him and that he was destined to rule it. In his mind, he was destined to lead the entire country, and no one could stand in his way, not a single person. How could it be that his homeland was lost, leaving him to wander in the woods like a deranged man? Who was responsible for this? A weak former president of Szczecin, who could not even hold onto his position when the Germans arrived? This outcome should never have occurred. That traitor was backed by the Germans, which is why he failed. Once again, he felt betrayed, and so too did the Polish people.\n\nHe had been losing contact with his remaining squads one by one. Soon after, he and his last loyal 20 soldiers were the only ones left. Olszański was ready to face his demise, but he would not give up easily. The last outpost of the Lizardian forces was heavily fortified, and the Szczecinians would have had a tough time taking him down. Lizardians would have succeeded, but they did not. Not all of his soldiers were loyal; one opportunist made a deal with Krzystek's government and opened the gates. A swarm of soldiers flooded the camp.\n\nWojciech fought with all his might, taking down many of his foes. Years of training had prepared him well. However, even with dozens of warriors like himself, success seemed impossible. Their enemies were too strong, those bastards, traitors, and anti-Poles. How could they betray their own? He found himself as the last man standing. Soon, he realized he was running out of ammunition.\n\nThat was it. Wojciech's fight for freedom was over. He prepared to leave his world by putting a gun in his mouth. When the Szczecinian forces knocked down the door, he pulled the trigger. Nonetheless, it did not fire.\n\n"Oh, fuck me" - he said before they pinned him to the ground.\n\nThey tackled him with brutal force, not sparing a moment for hesitation. One of the soldiers kicked the malfunctioning pistol out of reach while another tightened restraints around his wrists. Wojciech did not resist; he stared ahead, his eyes half-lidded and jaw tight.\n\n"Is that really him?" - one soldier whispered. Another nodded, nudging Wojciech's shoulder with the barrel of his rifle. "The madman himself."\n\nDragged from the building, bloodied and bruised, Olszański was paraded past what remained of his former command. Some bodies were already being covered, while others lay still, eyes open in eternal defiance. He refused to look away. He refused to blink.\n\nThe arrest of Wojciech Olszański marked the symbolic end of an era, one defined by paranoia, rebellion, and radical dreams of an empire that never was. But for Wojciech, it was not the end. As the truck rumbled toward the city, he stared at the ceiling, still believing that history had not seen the last of him. "

He praised the courage of Szczecin's citizens for standing against both occupation and despair and reminded the crowd that victory without vision is empty.\n\n"Our project was never just about survival. It was about revival. We did not fight to create a fractured fiefdom or a local authority. We fought and endured so that Poland may live again, in law, in justice, and truth."\n\nHe announced that new and fair elections would soon be organized to uphold the democratic process.

A man of an older generation, an experienced local politician, he was given a mission to bring order to nigh anarchistic chaos on the streets of the city and reorganise the partisan troops into an official armed force. And while he deals with that, a trio of ruthless corporations hangs over the city like vultures, looking for even the slightest of slip-ups.\n\nSoon he took off with the advisor and arrived at the conference room in a matter of minutes, keeping up a brisk pace despite his age. In front of a pedestal, which really was just a tall pile of neatly stacked bricks, sat a small army of clerks and experts from all areas of state affairs. Administration, policing, infrastructure, military specialists - the president requested the best people the city could offer. In silence, Henryk Jerzyk took his place at the pedestal and addressed the crowd."

szczecin.16.desc: "Szczecin was slowly rebuilding itself after the insurrection, most buildings and high street stores still in a sorry state, with windows covered in planks and walls splattered with anti-German graffiti. Among the sea of disrepair, like a haven, stood the \"Uśmiech\" Cafe, a restaurant in a painfully post-communist building near the Brama Portowa Square. Within it, two government officials sat at a table for four, wearing the best suits they could get their hands on, with unease painted all over their faces - they were there for an important meeting with the CEOs of the two corporations remaining in the Hanseatic Guild.\n\n- Awfully hot in here, don't you think, Cezary? - the first official spoke, wiping a stream of sweat from his brow using a handkerchief. \n- They should be here already... - The second man knocked on his wristwatch for the sixteenth time in the past half an hour. - Sweet Mary, there they are! \nOutside the cafe, a black limo stopped, tires screeching, standing out like a sore thumb in the surrounding cityscape with its perfectly waxed paintjob. The chauffer exited the car and opened the rear doors for two gentlemen, each wearing a perfectly tailored tuxedo and dark sunglasses, with only the tiny logos of the entities they represented upsetting their carefully selected fashion. The men made their way to the trunk and acquired a metallic document case. \n- Marek, snap out of it, you're gawking at them like a hawk. - Cezary nudged him with his elbow. - Play it cool, we can negotiate a good deal, just as the government requested. \nAs he nodded, the two representatives approached the table and took off their glasses. \n- Greetings gentlemen! It's a pleasure, please sit down and we'll order you some coffee. - The government employees reached out for a handshake. \n- Pleasantries won't be necessary. - The Netto representative spoke coldly while sitting down. \n- We, uh... thought the CEOs would make our acquaintance. - A stream of sweat has begun to flow once more down his forehead. \n- The Chairmen have more important business to attend to, thankfully for you, we've been tasked with personally handing you the documents regarding the deal the Guild graciously offers to the city of Szczecin. - The PMŻ representative set the metallic case on the table. \n- With all due respect, gentlemen... We were told that the terms are yet to be discussed. - Cezary's eyes darted from the representatives to the case and back again quickly. - This is frankly quite... \n- Benevolent? Gracious? - Netto envoy barged into his sentence. - The Guild has supported your reckless insurrection through its entire span; it'd be in your best interest to accept the terms of the deal how our organisation offers them. - The two representatives rose up from the table in unision."

After a loud declaration that the government would modernize the partisan force into a regular army, it'd be wise to have someone to provide the necessary equipment. That is why a tender was announced. Of course, when you announce a public tender in Szczecin, you're more than guaranteed to have it won by the Hanza. Now it was upon Jerzyk's shoulders to decide how much more of state power he was supposed to concede to the three corporate conglomerates.\nWhen their representative arrived, he was late. That coupled with a top-notch business suit and smug smirk communicated one simple message: 'You need us and we know that'.\n- Let's see how much of a pain in the ass he'll be - minster of war thought to himself and then spoke, extending his hand - Good day, sir.\n- Good day - the representative responded - My name is Maksymilian Kreziński and I'm representative of the Hanza guild.\n-Please take a seat.\n-As you may know, the companies I'm representing would be very much interested in helping our rising nation to arm their soldiers - he said with a disarming smile - As the primary tender showed only we had the necessary capital and know-how to potentially follow through.\nWhile he was saying that he slid over a folder to the minister. It details the future accomplishing of commission.\n- Well, Mr. Kreziński - Jerzyk said while browsing through the files - While we are grateful for your... offer, you have to realize we are concerned about your companies' inexperience in fulfilling military contracts.\nJerzyk may have known little about the military. Still, he knew how to haggle when it came to public money.\n-I understand your doubts - Kreziński didn't let himself be taken aback - I understand your doubts. Still, we are ready for new possibilities that have arisen. PŻM has already bought Felmax and Hit refineries to produce the reinforcing steel necessary for the project. Especially, that part of our alliance is suited for the rebranding given their experience in the production of hardened hulls. That gives the experience to start the production of artillery and armored cars.\nHe made a good point. Still, the lecture on their plan raised new suspicions in Jerzyk.\n-The amount of investment is surprisingly low. It may not be enough.\n-We tried to balance the needs of the nation with economic viability and the speed of production. - he defended himself - What's the use of the military equipment if it doesn't arrive on time? Or drains the state budget?\n- I have to urge you to reconsider. We need a higher starting investment fund to ensure the quality we desire. - Jerzyk was growing wary of further excuses - Otherwise, we'd be forced to cut the deal before the work even begins.\n-Naturally - the representative tried to remain calm - But only we have the necessary capital and production output to handle this commission. With all due respect, trying to complete the task on your own will be more costly, and more time-consuming and your success won't be guaranteed.\nKreziński looked at his watch.\n-I leave the decision to you. Thank you for your time."

szczecin.18.t: "The Summer Union"
szczecin.18.desc: "It was a rather ordinary day for Karol Piotrkowski. He had been working as a journalist before the collapse, during the Lindner regime, and now under the presidency of Piotr Krzystek. Regardless of who ruled the nation and now the city, being a journalist felt rather dull and repetitive. Politicians always lied, and people had their stupid arguments or jealousy. Since he had begun working for the Voice of Szczecin, nothing impressed him. Now, a new party, the Summer Union, was formed, and his responsibility was to create proper reportage during Bogdan Jaroszewicz's speech in Jasne Błonie.\n\nWhen Jaroszewicz energetically entered the scene, he did not expect anything from him. He was just another liar and kleptocrat, filling the public with empty words. However, he could not help but listen to the open and amusing man.\n\nJaroszewicz began with a joke that surprised Karol and captivated the public's attention. It was a departure from typical political small talk. Bogdan stressed the importance of the public and everyday citizens, stating that it is essential to support them during the rebuilding process. He assured that his newly formed party would respect every citizen and strive to create a welfare state that is inclusive for everyone. Jaroszewicz promised that large businesses associated with the Hanseatic Guild would not be allowed to exploit people as they did under Lindner's administration. His party was the party of the people.\n\nAs the speech approached its conclusion, Karol was taken aback. He was well-versed in the art of manipulation and could usually identify when a politician was being dishonest. However, this time felt different; Jaroszewicz was not lying. In fact, Karol found himself believing what was being said. The message resonated deeply with him: it was a vision for a future that embraced everyone, regardless of their status - big or small.\n\nBefore leaving the stage, Jaroszewicz cracked another joke and announced that it was time for the famous singer Margaret to present her newest song, which would include the thoughts and feelings of the common people. When she entered, Karol froze; everything felt like a dream. People were united - on that day, everyone was equal. Everyone was having fun, and as she began to sing, so did they all.\n\nKarol partied for hours. He had never experienced such fun before; even in his wildest dreams, he could not have imagined something like this. After returning home and sleeping off his hangover, Piotrkowski felt a strong urge to write that report. He finally felt a sense of purpose and rediscovered his joy in journalism. All of this was because of a simple man and his straightforward idea to create a better nation for everyone."

szczecin.19.desc: "Zbigniew Bogucki felt uneasy. Although this wasn't his first speech, he had given many before and would give many more; the significance of this one weighed heavily on him. Szczecin had just been liberated from the Germans, and Piotr Krzystek, their esteemed president, had entrusted him with forming the Castle. Bogucki still remembered his time with PiS, when he was often sidelined by the omnipotent Jarosław Kaczyński and largely forgotten. Then came the collapse. He had lived like a partisan, fighting against those bastards, the invaders. Day after day, and now? Now, he was the leader of a party, the lone bastion of conservative values in Szczecin.\n\nAs he stepped onto the stage, he felt a wave of stress wash over him. However, when he looked into the eyes of the thousands of people gathered in the courtyard of the Castle of Pomeranian Princes, that anxiety disappeared. These people had come to hear what he had to say. They wanted to know if their future was finally secure and if they could trust him to lead them.\n\nBefore starting, he thanked everyone for coming together. Bogucki emphasized that if it were not for the brave citizens of Szczecin, they would not be in that moment. He then began sharing the story of his life, starting from his early days as a regular member of PiS. He spoke about how, when the collapse occurred, he set political disputes aside to fight for democracy and freedom. Zbigniew expressed his honour in standing alongside the courageous people of Szczecin to resist the Germans. Now, he felt he had an opportunity to give back for their bravery and selflessness.\n\nZbigniew Bogucki continued with promoting the agenda of his newly formed party, ZKL. The party would serve as a protector of traditional values and ensure the safety of Szczecin. Bogucki implied that, under his leadership, there would never be an invasion or enslavement. He promised that everyone would have access to food and that rural areas would not be neglected. ZKL would show deep care and support for farmers, ensuring proper subsidies.\n\nHe continued his speech and soon realized that the audience was responding positively. When he finished, everyone applauded and cheered his name, while banners for his party appeared. He had not expected such enthusiasm, but it energized him and boosted his confidence. Now, Bogucki was prepared to fulfil his duty as a servant of the people. However, he felt wary of Jaroszewicz's enthusiasm. Jaroszewicz could be challenging to work with due to his leftist ideas. Nevertheless, this was not the time for such concerns; it was time to celebrate."

szczecin.20.desc: "The first parliamentary gathering was never going to be easy. Piotr Krzystek had expected disputes and heated arguments, but nothing like what unfolded. The inaugural session turned into a cauldron of shouting and insults. At one point, someone even tried to punch a politician from the opposing side of the aisle. It was pure chaos. To Krzystek, it felt strikingly similar to the Polish Sejm - and the turmoil that so often erupted there. Was Szczecin truly the same as pre-collapse Poland?\n\nPiotr Krzystek sat on a raised platform, right in the centre of the parliamentary hall, overlooking the heated debate unfolding before him. He was the president, but now, no one seemed to respect that. If things continued down this path, the entire country would not function properly. And he could not allow that. He had not spent years fighting the Germans just to watch his homeland be torn apart by greedy, quarrelsome politicians.\n\n"ORDEEEEER!" Krzystek stood up abruptly, his voice booming through the vast parliamentary hall, echoing off the marble walls and silencing, for a moment, the storm of voices. His face was flushed with fury, eyes blazing as he surveyed the chaotic chamber.\n\n"What is this?!"  - he barked, sweeping his arm in a wide gesture across the floor.\n"Where do you think you are - in a circus or a goddamn parliament?!"\nDozens of heads turned, some startled, others defiant. The shouting had stopped, but the tension had not vanished. A few members sank into their seats, embarrassed. Others rolled their eyes, unrepentant. One delegate near the back muttered something under his breath, earning a sharp glare from a neighbour.\n\nKrzystek took a deep breath, steadying himself.\n\n"You were elected to serve the people,"  - he continued, voice lower now but still firm, cutting through the silence like a blade.\n"Not to throw insults like drunkards in a tavern. Not to swing fists when you run out of words."\nHis knuckles whitened as he gripped the edge of the podium.\n"If this is how you intend to lead, then you are not just disgracing yourselves - you are dismantling the very idea of this nation."\n\nAfter his words settled in the hall, no one dared to speak. Some were embarrassed, others simply afraid of the man's authority - but none dared to continue the argument. Everyone sat still, waiting in tense anticipation for Krzystek's next words.\n\n"Alright. Now, we shall continue," - Krzystek said firmly. "

Everything seemed alright.\nThat is, until Krzystek received an offer of negotiations by a representative of the company. To its effect, a ceasefire was issued, although the president didn't exactly see himself accepting any deal the company put forward. That all changed, however, as he met the representative in the field.\n\n- Hold on, you're telling me... WHAT THE HELL?!\n\nKrzystek had a lot of things on the list of expectations for that meeting, \"The board begs for mercy while giving him full control of the plant\" being the most favourable option.  §R\"The board rigged the whole chemical plant to blow at the press of a button\"§! was not one of them, however. After the brief freakout, he quickly composed himself.\n\n- Well then... I... what do we have to do to... stop this unfortunate turn of events?\n- Halt the assault, and the chemical plant will go untouched. In fact, we're ready to graciously cooperate with your government in a system of mutual exchange if you accept.\n\nDespite how much he'd love to see that german cunt blow up his main source of income, he knew: the chemical plant was too important to sacrifice for the sake of liberationist ideology. It seemed like he had only one choice.\nThe pen came down upon the paper with the peace agreement written out, and signed it in slow, deliberate strokes as Krzystek looked at the representative with the most contempt he'd ever held towards a person in his life. The only thing said representative could offer back is a neutral, slightly awkward expression before retracting the paper and reading it over again, making note of the new signature at the bottom\n\n- Well, that's settled then. Hopefully this will be a lucrative partnership for us both."

Free Cities my ass!\n\nThe men looked at each other surprised - That doesn't sound good. I guess now we at least know why Piotr called us. Let's pick up the pace a little bit. - They hurriedly walked into the building and arrived upstairs, greeted by the President's new secretary who looked a little spooked by the commotion inside the office. The General adjusted his uniform and entered the room first. The rest of the government was already there.\n- Came as soon as we could, what's happening?\n- It's that damn League of Free Cities! We kicked the Germans out of Police and now they claim we are \"expanding\" and \"threatening\"! - Krzystek burst out again - And they had the gall to stop all trade between us! Do you know what this means?!\n- That Szczecin is going to starve in about a month? - Bogucki, the minister of economy from The Castle party answered.\n- If not sooner... - Jaroszewicz, the prime minister from The Summer Union added.\n- Yeah thanks for the optimism Bogdan. - Krzystek looked at him with disdain - But yes, we're going to be in deep shit very soon if we do not act. And just so you all know before anyone dares to suggest it, importing food from the damn Germans is out of the fucking question.\n- General Koziatek and I were just inspecting our garrison on Ku Słońcu Street when you called - Henryk took the opportunity to stop the President from spiraling further - if there really is no other option, the military is ready to act.\n- You cannot be serious! - The Minister of the Interior, Małgorzata Jamroży, responded immediately. - Our citizens barely came out of the revolution and the invasion of Chemiewerke, we're plunging ourselves into a constant state of war!\n- Listen, I appreciate your concern for our citizens' lives, but with no food in the city in a few months we will have a famine on our hands. - Jaroszewicz spoke up again. -  This is no time for idealist dreams of constant peace.\n\nEveryone looked towards Krzystek, who was tapping his fingers on the desk with increasing strength with one hand, his head resting on the other.

In a place where everyone hates him and wishes him death. Alone, among the wolves. The seeming peace seen outside was only a facade. The order that he had imposed was already gone. Although with the constant pressure from Berlin and this traitorous smuck Tusk, he sometimes found moments of peace. Such like this. Outside, life went as usual. Like the hell of the past years, have never actually happened.\n\nIf someone had thought Lindner was fond of the idea of the German intervention, he would have been far from the truth. He never fully supported it. Some speculate that this was the thing that got him here, speaking against those who were higher than him. Deep inside, he knew about his wrongdoings. Poles wanted freedom, which he perfectly understood. His actual desire was to return home, visit the Bundestag, and wander through the streets of Berlin. \n\nBut his dreams and personal views were irrelevant. He had to impose order or end up worse than in the position of Eurogouverneur. This so-called Griffin Guard was a significant ick for him. Another problem was the blood-sucking Hanseatic Guild. Surrounded by enemies everywhere, his power was limited. Krzystek's clique had silent approval and support from the general population, and the resources were too scarce to diminish this threat. Guild, on the other hand, had total control over the state's economy and could shuffle him whenever they wanted. \n\nHis inner peace was no more. Dark thoughts overcame Lindner's mind. Christian extinguished his cigar and slowly walked over to his desk. A load of various reports was already there. He briefly riffled through them with boredom. Military posts attacked there, supply lines disrupted elsewhere - only the worst news, as always. In Stettin, only the most atrocious things can happen to me - Lindner thought. After finishing the reports, before even getting a chance to take a short break to rest, he heard a persistent knock on the door. \n\nIt was his closest ally, Herman Otto Soms. It was a short conversation. Even if Lindner considered a chance to keep peace in Stettin, now he knows his every move is meaningless. At least they have been notified about Germany's intention to abandon Eurokommisariats. After Soms left, he poured himself a glass of whisky, likely left by Krzystek. He must have found joy in governing this city; he never opened it - Lindner murmured to himself. Abandoned by his own country, Christian finally realized how his predecessor felt. There was no hope for him. He had no chance to see his beloved fatherland once again. He knew that judgment day was just around the corner. \n\nHe was ready."

He had inflicted too much pain on the citizens of Szczecin, and his actions had led to the deaths of many, including his people. Therefore, it did not shock him when Piotr Krzystek decided that fateful night to imprison him and hold him accountable for his crimes. In Krzystek's position, he would have done the same. Yet, acknowledging his mistakes did not erase his longing for his homeland. Christian wanted desperately to see Wuppertal again, but that possibility no longer existed.\n\nHe was being held on Kaszubska Street. The cell was cramped and reeking of damp concrete, a far cry from the spacious halls and well-furnished apartments Lindner had once called home. Two days had passed since they threw him in here. They fed him, yes, but only the bare minimum, just enough to keep him upright. No one had told him when his trial would begin. That was deliberate. The uncertainty was a tactic, designed to keep him anxious, off balance, constantly bracing for the sound of footsteps in the corridor. Nevertheless, Christian knew it would not take them too long to finally get rid of him.\n\nIronically, just as the thought crossed his mind, the door of his cell creaked open. Two broad-shouldered guards stepped in and wordlessly hauled him to his feet. As they marched him through the prison corridors, the Polish inmates jeered from behind the bars, hurling insults and mockery with twisted delight. He kept his head down, jaw clenched.\nThey shoved him into a van with blacked-out windows. The engine roared to life, and they drove through the city. Somehow, word must have gotten out, because people had gathered along the streets, shouting, spitting, and screaming slurs as the vehicle passed. It was not a regular transfer. It was a parade of humiliation of Christian.\n\nSuddenly, as they crossed Grunwaldzki Square, gunshots rang out. The van swerved violently as the driver lost control, slamming into a streetlamp with a metallic crunch. Lindner was thrown forward, his head colliding hard with the divider. Pain bloomed instantly, and the world spun in a chaotic blur of noise and motion. Dazed and bleeding, he barely registered the rear doors being torn open. Masked men dragged him out into the open before he could comprehend what was happening. Everything was spinning, and then, darkness.\n\nWhen he regained consciousness, he found himself seated beside armed men, their faces cold and unreadable. Every question he asked was met with silence; they did not even glance his way. Their focus was singular: escorting their prisoner. A creeping dread settled in Lindner's chest. He did not know what had happened, but every instinct told him it was not good.\nAs the van sped down the road, he caught sight of a road sign through the window. The letters were all too familiar:\nPolice - 5 km.\nHe had a sinking feeling it would be the end of the road, in more ways than one."

Looking at these products, pasta, ham, even a chocolate bar or two, plastered with well-known logos and flags of nations the Polish could barely dream of traveling to made him think two things. For one, what kind of wizardry did those corpos use to supply all this into this region of the world? And for two, well...\n\n"What the hell am I going to get?"\n\nWhen he returned home, he was greeted to, as always, his wife.

While she was used to her husband spending... a little more than expected, usually on a little cheap wine, this was an especially egregious case. Laid out in the bag was a smorgasbord of products with enough multinational markings on them to simulate touring the world three times over. Irish butter, exotic french cheese, various kinds of Mediterranean ham, it was a sight to behold for sure.\n\n"Where in the name of Christ did you get all this?", she questioned him, clearly agitated.\n\n"I...

Before beginning his work for today, he took a moment to reminisce.\nOh my chemical plant, what have they done to you?\nHe once knew it as the Zakłady Chemiczne, back in the good old days... pay was good, and he could focus on his work, even as the situation in the capital deteriorated. But after the German invasion and the company's renaming, things began to... change. Pay began to dwindle, hours began to lengthen, and before he knew it, everything in Police had the Zakłady... no, the Chemiewerke logo on it. Everything from the store where he bought his bread to the bus he and the others took to the plant, it was almost like the company was trying to initiate a twisted cycle, where they lost no money paying their wage slaves by owning all the businesses in the town... perhaps that's what they all were at this point. Slaves with more printed paper involved.\nAnd the guards... to hell with the guards. They just... stood there, never said a word to anyone. Any time anyone was working too slow, they heard that all-too-familiar click behind their backs... and they sped right back up. Janek wondered: were the guards being paid any better? Were they given any sort of benefits for serving their corporation like unfeeling machines? Or... maybe they were just German. Those have already proven they haven't changed a thing since 1933. What little World War II history he remembered flooded back to his mind, the descriptions of treacherous work within German factories on the Generalgouvernement's territory... it seemed like there was not a single difference from what he'd describe here.\nFor just a second, he thought about... jumping into the vat in front of him. As protest. Just to show everyone he thought that letting the alkaline solution claim him was preferable to a day more of this madness. He thought about it just for a second more before deciding: nah. He had a retired mother to help support, after all.

Jeez!\n\nThe guard, humoring him, lowered his submachine gun, and Janek, still carefully, took his place at the station. There was going to be an especially large order today, so he would have to be prepared to say extra long... I suppose that's just the way it is."

szczecin.30.desc: "Just outside the West Pommeranian metropolis, green pastures stretched out towards the horizon, however underneath the wide grasslands, a sad truth was hiding - barren sandy soil. Year after year, Mr. Wiesław, an elderly owner of a medium vegetable farm just outside Szczecin marked an unsetling, but stable decline of harvests. Handpicked carrots that he remembered from his childhood, orange and robust were nothing more than shrivelled up, brown crayons nowadays. The traditional, all natural fertilisers he, just like all his ancestors used seemed to not be sufficent for the growing agricultural demands of a nation that's rebuilding. Resigned, Wiesław left his carrot field and walked slowly towards the apple orchard, sighing at all the weak and grayish plants of his infertile farm. The trees there looked extraordinarily bleak this year, bearing only few, very small, greenish fruit. He took off his dirty glove and pulled an apple from a tree, biting into it, he couldn't help but cringe at how sour it was. As he continued to chew with a face painted in distaste, he thought of a letter he had recieved recently, addressed to him directly, from the local fertilizer factory in Police. In it, the representative boasted about how amazing the newly introduced chemicals in the plant feed mixture - a result of recently changed legislation by the government of Szczecin, work on doubling, or even tripling the harvests. A year's worth of free trial of this new "magic" solution was just a phonecall away. As he looked upon his dying, infertile farm, he sighed, begging his ancestors for forgivness, as in desperation, he reached into the pocket of his overalls. \n \n Some time has passed since the Chemiewerke cistern trucks came in and offloaded this new, horrid liquid into his fertilizer silo. The colour of it was out of this world and the smell was so awful, that spreading it using his trusty Ursus C-360 required a full haz-mat suit. However the results were anything but spectacular: carrots that his family grown on these fields for centuries have now basically burst out of the ground by themselves. As long as you ignore the yellow hue and the sharp taste of turmeric, these are the largest Wiesław has ever seen in his long life at the farm. Orchard was also "blessed" by a new bountiful harvest, although the apples, big enough to make the branches bend under their weight were deep green and tasted of pistachios, but surely he could market them as "Dubai Apples" or something like that. With how desperate the city folk are for produce nowadays, they'll buy anything if it's plentiful and priced fairly enough. Now Wiesław looked upon his newly reinvigorated farmstead, still sceptical about how this new, scary liquid from Chemiewerke will impact the soil for years to come, but he couldn't help himself picturing a brand new Lamborghini tractor in his garage, in place of his father's old C-360."

szczecin.32.desc: "The trip to shipyard Wulkan was rather uneventful for Zbigniew, who stood, as usual, near the last set of handles in the bus, on the left side. As he looked up from his phone as the bus reached his destination, however, he saw something... extremely peculiar\nA beat-up \"Solidarność\" banner which has probably seen the days of the 1980s dockyard strikes, hanging over the shipyard gate.\n\nIn this day and age? He had heard of Solidarity establishing itself in post-fall Poland, sure, but... it was mostly concentrated near Gdańsk, with some small pockets somewhere else he'd heard of. What the hell was this doing here? Was this some kind of prank?\n\nAs he left the bus and walked through the gate, he was met with even more surprising sights in the form of posters loudly proclaiming a strike on every wall and surface that could conceivably hold them. This confused him even more. A strike? What? This seemed like a complete joke... not that he was entirely HAPPY with the conditions at the shipyard, sure, considering he once had a coworker die of his injuries in order to not get his family into medical debt, but... what room would there be to change? After all, this was the Fall, they were struggling to get by as is, probably, with no government help after the Griffon Insurgency.\n\nSuddenly, Zbigniew's coworker Bartek ran up to him, looking quite ecstatic to see him! If everything else were to fly past him, then the look on Bartek's face signified that, clearly, something major was happening.\n\n- Ey! Zbigniew! PŻM just got government subsidies, so we're striking! Y'know, would be nice to get stuff like health insurance... rest in peace, Edmund, ya poor bastard.\n\nZbigniew's eyebrows bounced in a way that communicated his intrigue. Everything clicked... well, he supposed there's no better thing to do! Time to get some benefits! Health insurance! Better pay! More breaks! What a time to be alive!\n\nEventually, after a few hours of the strike, a PŻM representative arrived in a company-marked car. They looked exacerbated as they stumbled out of the car, making panicked hand motions, clipboard in hand, as they ran to the striking workers and beginning to shout.\n\n- Alright! We hear you! We're... we're here to negotiate!"

The one constant, however, was work... or... a strange facsimile of work he had gotten used to since Poland's fall. As he got to the shipyard, he put a cheap cigarette into his mouth and lit it using an equally cheap lighter. Was he there to build ships?\nBitch, please.\nOf course he wasn't there to build ships, you fool! He was there to do everything but, in fact. As he walked towards what would normally be his station, he greeted a co-worker with a raised hand.\n\n- 'Ey! How's it goin', Bartek?\n\nHe began, lifting the cigarette out of his mouth with two fingers, a smile forming on his face. Seems like today was just going to be another day of chatting, smoking, drinking and not doing much of importance... and to get paid for this sort of life? What a jam!\n\n- Eh, nothin' much. Heard we're gettin' a new supervisor... but y'know how it is, nothing ever changes, just this till they shut the place down...\n\nBartek responded, laughing a bit.\nJust then, something rather unexpected happened.\nA loud call of "ORDER!" came through the shipyard, causing a few workers, Zbigniew included, to jump in surprise. Where the hell did that come from?\nAs it turned out, the call came from the new supervisor, who, with a stern expression on his face, commanded the group of lazing labourers further:\n\n- Line, in front of me! Now!\n\nSeeking not to displease the intimidating presence in front of them, they quickly gathered into a messy, but somewhat coherent line in front of their supervisor. Zbigniew still had the cigarette in his mouth, which the man in front of him seemed less than blind to.\n\nAs the supervisor marched towards him, he felt himself breaking a sweat from the pressure. The boss plucked the cigarette from his mouth in one swift motion, holding it between two fingers vertically.\n\n- No smoking in the shipyard. UNDERSTAND?\n\nHe said, before throwing the cigarette down onto the ground and stomping on it, putting it out. Zbigniew didn't protest. After all, what could exactly be done? And besides... maybe this'd make life a bit more interesting.\nThe overseer marched back away from the line, and began to speak to the workers:\n\n- The Szczecinian navy has just commissioned a fleet of trade ships and monitors from us, and I expect ALL of you to not use this as an excuse to just drink the day away! If I catch any of you lazing around instead of doing your fucking job, there WILL be consequences, understood?\nBrief silence followed. None of them knew exactly what to say, but the supervisor seemed to get what they meant by it.\n\n- Alright, in that case... get to work, ya lazy bums!\n\nZbigniew and Bartek rushed to their allocated positions in the shipyard. Despite the long break, they still remembered what their job was, and they weren't out of it to the point of justifying firing. Zbigniew wasn't sure what to think of it, but he supposed things were going back to normal after all."

He made himself a dissolvable black coffee, which he quickly downed before getting ready and heading to his first lecture of the day.\nOn the way there, he began to wonder... what was in it for his future? I mean... college is cool, his parents are proud, grades are good, everyone's happy, but... what after? Szczecin is a completely hopeless nation for someone of his mechanical education, industrially speaking, and the only possible places to work most of the time are the Hansa. Working for Chemiewerke Politz is more reminiscent of slavery in German death camps than legitimate work, PŻM is completely decaying, leaving completely zero job security, and Netto just... isn't his style. He knew his parents would hate to see it happen, but... it almost seemed like he'd have to run across the border in order to find adequate work. It wasn't a pretty realisation, but it was certainly one that came to mind.\nJust as his mind cleared up on the issue, he had gotten to the lecture. The day passed like many others. One lecture, then another, then a seminary, and so on. He could barely resist falling asleep, but he managed. Soon, returning to the dorm, he greeted the securityman in the reception, to which he got an unexpected answer.\n\n- Well, hello there, mr Wysocki! I believe I may have something for you!\n\nHugo raised an eyebrow... something for him? He watched on as the security employee retrieved something from below the desk and handed it to him.\nAn envelope\nHe soon opened it to see the PŻM logo on the center of the folded letter inside. Wait... what?\nHe then took the letter out of the envelope and unfolded it.\nIt was a proposal from the company. A proposal for apprenticeship and then employment in a PŻM research facility, where he would help design new solutions and ships for the company.\n\nHugo nearly skipped back down to his dorm, filled with excitement and relief at the same time.

szczecin.36.desc: "When word of Krzystek's plan reached the government, it struck like a bolt of thunder - loud, jarring, and impossible to ignore. To everyone's surprise, it managed to unite the ZKL and the Summer Union once again. Jaroszewicz and Bogucki quickly arranged a meeting in the parliamentary hall, doing so without the president's knowledge or approval. They had to act. The plan was madness. Who could have predicted it? Krzystek, the architect of the post-collapse order, now intended to crown himself king. A monarch - in the 21st century! It was unthinkable. Dangerous. And it had to be stopped before it spiralled out of control. As the parliament assembled, a tense silence filled the chamber. Many members looked around in stunned confusion, unsure of how to respond. Whispers echoed off the marble walls, but no one dared speak aloud, waiting instead for the two political heavyweights to begin. All eyes turned to Jaroszewicz and Bogucki, hoping for direction.\n\nBogdan Jaroszewicz began first.\n\n"It is outrageous that President Piotr Krzystek has chosen to act in direct defiance of the fundamental principles of our democratic republic. In doing so, he has betrayed not only the constitution but the very people of Pomerania. We cannot, and must not, allow such reckless ambition to take root - let our nation descend into autocracy, mirroring the very regime we once stood united against. That is not what we fought for during the long years of resistance against Lindner's oppressive state. Therefore, I hereby propose a vote of no confidence in the incumbent president."\n\nBefore he could continue, Jaroszewicz was interrupted mid-speech by Zbigniew Bogucki.\n\n"Mr Jaroszewicz, while we may not always see eye to eye, I must concur with you on this critical issue. The prospect of Krzystek declaring himself king stands in direct opposition to the very essence of our republic's values. Yet, we find ourselves facing a grim reality. He enjoys widespread support among the populace and commands significant respect within our military ranks. Are we prepared to risk a coup? I fear that any attempt to unseat him could prompt our armed forces and citizens to rally in his defence, potentially plunging us into the very autocracy we seek to avoid. Perhaps, in light of these circumstances, our best course of action is to remain silent and accept the inevitability of his coronation, even if it means singing 'Long Live the King' on that day."\n\nJaroszewicz felt a mix of frustration and resignation. The weight of the situation pressed heavily on him, and he knew that acting out of anger would lead to more chaos.\n\n"Mr. Bogucki," he finally said, his voice steadier than he felt, "while I still believe we cannot simply stand idly by, I understand your perspective. Perhaps it is time to shift our focus. Instead of a no-confidence vote, we could work to strengthen our democratic institutions from within. If we can rally enough support for a united front, we might be able to chart a course that preserves our values in the face of this challenge. Let us find ways to engage with the populace to remind them of the principles we hold dear. We have to show that the will of the people can still be a guiding force, rather than succumb to despair over Krzystek's ambitions.""

When the meeting was called, he knew exactly what to propose. It was his main field of study, after all. All his life, he had spent cataloguing things relating to Britain, enough to know they were the perfect candidate for our new ally, at the very least.\nA pause ensued; the members of the committee looked around at each other. Eventually, the leader spoke up.\n\n- Yeah? What about them? - Krzystek said, uncertain what to make of the question. - I mean... they're out of the EU, but... do you think they'll be able to help us mu-\n\n- No, think about it, REALLY think about it... the Brits have always been on the other side of the Germans, opposing their imperialistic expansion and hegemony, right? What do you think YOU were fighting against? The thing that strangled our government from behind with the promise of friendly protection? There's no denying it; Germany is in another age of imperialism, and the UK is always a good ally when that's involved. Maybe we could get their blessing as the official successor of Poland, even? I mean, who are they gonna support, the Lizards? That... wizard-king-music producer from Opole?\n\nThe more Krzystek thought about the possibility, the more it made sense. The points slowly began to click with him, and again, they were desperate for allies. Any possibility was good; even Transnistria was briefly contemplated before being shot down in about a second.\n\n- Well... I see why we should at least attempt it... and all of you, gentlemen?\n\nNods and \"mhms\" spread across the hall with the speed of the common cold. It seemed the thought was unilateral.- Well... in that case, I do believe it's settled. We will seek diplomatic relations with and assistance from Great Britain then!\n\n- Thank you all for listening and agreeing with me. - Toszek said professionally, though with a hint of pride at his idea being approved by the president. He couldn't help but sneak a snarky remark into his otherwise professional appearance.\n\n- Oh, please don't attempt to send them tea and crumpets as diplomatic gifts.

The city had really gone downhill since the fall, if it was even possible to go down from where it was before, and Jola was someone who could attest to that. Everything was in short supply, housing was still in dire straits due to the war, and worse, nobody had the chance of moving out with how little they had. And it's not like the situation was better anywhere else. So they lived out their days. It was just a painful, difficult monotony, paired with relentless food rationing and the slow, unwavering decay of what little services the city could still provide to its citizens. But on this day everything was about to change.\nHer husband burst into the house, surprise clearly painted on his face, and loudly announced:\n\n- Jola, come! Some weird foreign ship's docking into the port!\n\nImmediately, they both rushed out to see what was happening, and indeed, there it was: a strangely-marked cargo ship docked at the port, proudly displaying the British flag on its mast. And next to it another flag with some sort of... green, cut off eight symbol?\nBut what it would soon unload would be of greater interest - the port cranes came to life, hoisting pallets full of white containers, with the same logo as on the flag plastered over them and labeled  \"OXFAM\"...Jola recognized those, from some... pre-Fall documentary? About disaster relief in Africa? Are those humanitarian aid packages? But what the hell is OXFAM?\nSoon enough, a train arrived, and the pallets were methodically being loaded onto the cars.\nThen, a whole torrent of people, all with what could only be presumed to be the OXFAM logo on their shirts and vests, poured out of the ship. The crowd, which had gathered around the port entrance, just as curious as the married couple was as to the sudden foreign presence, exploded in discussion.\nJust then, one of the arrivals, with a megaphone, announced in perfect, if somewhat accented Polish:\n\n- Hello, citizens of Poland! We are from the British humanitarian organisation OXFAM! We are here to provide aid on request of the West Pomeranian government!\n\nWhat he said next didn't matter too much, Jola had heard enough to know something for sure."

Owned by one of the corporations from the Big Three, it was a sophisticated, indoors sports hall for just over 5.000 people, but today, amidst the victory of the Summer Union in recent parlimentary elections, it hosted a massive party rally, during which the future of the state will be decided. Just past 4pm, afternoon sun shyly looked upon the city from behind of light gray rain clouds, illuminating a red BMW limousine, clearly standing out in a gray, wet city, splashing a puddle in front of the arena, while stopping by the kerbside. Paparazzis gathered around the building swarmed the car, as they knew what it's arrival meant, the "Bloody Mary" is here. Fashionably late to the rally, leader of the radical wing of the Summer Union - the diva singer Margaret, wearing a bright red skirt suit emerged from the back of the limo, with her bodyguard holding an umbrella over her head. Accompanied by camera flashes and journalists begging for her attention, she made her way inside the arena, where her more moderate party co-members awaited her. \n \n - And that's why I insist on co-operation with... - Leader of the moderate wing, Bogdan Jaroszewicz, surprised by the slam of the doors to the main hall jumped up. - Madame Margaret, we're glad you're finally here. - The gladness was, especially on his part quite forced, as he looked to his side while fixing his glasses. \n - I had hoped to miss your cowardly speech, Mr Jaroszewicz. - Margaret spoke, as her bright red outfit illuminated the room full of dark suited men and women of the Summer Union, as she passed by them on her way to the speech pedestal. - But I think I'm still in too early. You very well know that the people of Szczecin chose us, because we offer true change, a true shake-up of this rancid bog of a state. If the citizens wanted a copy-cat of old world politics, they would've picked Castle, but they've put their trust in us! \n - I'm aware of that fact, just as much as you are, madame, that our society requires drastic measures to change the established order, but you also know that our situation is quite peculiar. - He looked across the room, and then back to his brightly coloured party co-member. - The tentacles of Hansa run deep and throughout this city, and what you propose, will surely cause an economical breakdown at best, and a corporational coup at worst. We can't have that, it's not what we promised to our people. \n - This kind of thinking is exactly the reason why Szczecin chose the Summer Union, to truly set fire to the old establishment, and the people handed US the torch of revolution! - she raised her arms, to an applause from the radical wing of the arena. \n The debate went on and on for several hours, as both sides argued their ways, and what they agreed on will only be apparent to the common citizen in upcoming days."

He nodded to unity. To shared sacrifice. To cooperation with the Union, where it serves our national interest.\nAnd then she stood up.\nFrom the third row, to the right of the aisle, Jacyna-Witt broke away from the crowd like a gust of wind at a funeral. Her presence seemed to pull light toward her, or maybe just attention. Her jaw was tight. Her arms didn't swing. She walked with purpose and no grace.\nBogucki saw her. His voice didn't falter, but his eyes sharpened, just slightly. Not fear, just irritation. Familiar, worn irritation.\nHe had no patience for her. Never had. Not for the way she always spoke as if she were above procedure, above strategy, above the machinery of governance itself. Arrogant. Shrill, some said. Always one phrase too loud, one word too far.

A few groans. Some eyes rolled, others narrowed. Most just stared forward, tight-lipped.\nJacyna didn't care. -You promise stability by accepting their terms. Their quotas. Their oversight. Is that sovereignty now?\nSomeone chuckled under their breath. One of the backbenchers whispered something about the local fringe theatre. But still, no one stopped her.\nBogucki didn't respond right away. He looked at her. Not answering, just watching. Measuring. Everyone in the room could tell he loathed her. She made no secret of her contempt either. It wasn't just ideological. It was personal. Two bodies in orbit, spinning opposite directions, locked in a silent war for gravity.\nMiss Jacyna,- he said, -you mistake defiance for duty. Again.-\nHe took a step away from the podium.

szczecin.44.desc: "As government reforms started to roll in, the suits at the top have decided that the all people living inside the borders of Szczecin need to be heard. Democracy by representation is one of the big points in the city hall's program for improving the life within and around the metropolis. Zbigniew wasn't truly convinced by the beautiful and better-than-life promises made by the politicians, but the opportunity to get a properly paid job in today's economy as the "Citizen Representative" was too hard to pass. His new duties were to attend meetings in various villages and towns in the countryside, to hear out the worries and wishes of concerned citizens, and relay them up the chain of command. "Piss easy" he thought, as he signed the paperwork, somewhat charmed by the promise of a suit and a car all provided by the state. Nobody has told him that the suit was second hand and mismeasured, while the amazing automobile to represent the prosperity of the country was a rusting, green Fiat Seicento that has seen better days about 25 years ago. He cursed himself as he had to push the small rust bucket out of the mud for the 5th time this week, while driving to some god forsaken shithole with two wooden huts and a barn. Today, luckily it wasn't raining, so he managed to not get stuck in a country road that never seen asphalt, but on other hand, the car gifted him with a loud bang and engine simply stopping. Stranded in the middle of nowhere, on his way to Babinek, he put his face in his hands and sighed deeply. However, like a blessing to an exhausted traveller, he heard a rumble of an old diesel motor. An old Ursus tractor was going down the road, heading towards the village nearby. Zbigniew jolted out of the car and waved at the farmer, who stopped beside him, noticing the plume of smoke leaving the engine bay of the green Fiat. \n - Oy, city boy, need a pull? - The rancher spoke with a cigarette in his mouth. \n - If you'd be so kind, sir, I'm from the city hall, Citizen Representative heading for Babinek. \n - Ah, you're that fancy shmancy bureauman that villagehead spoke of, I was lookin' to report that goshdarn' fiend Cichowski, lemme tell ya, he stealin' me cows, I'm sure of it! \n Reluctantly, but somewhat relieved to not be stranded in a middle of a field, he hitched up his Seicento to the tractor with help of the farmer, and after a long while, they arrived at Babinek, village outside Szczecin. There, the Citizen Representative heard out the locals, which mainly boiled down to harvest failures, stolen cows, day drinking and indecent exposures. That made it the fifteenth village this month with the same issues that he had to hear out, nod to and promise to relay upstream and fix soon. After hours of listening to weeping old ladies and pissed of farmers, he finally got around to try and call for roadside assistance. "No signal, amazing" - he thought, relieved only in the notion that he doesn't have to check which village he's going to next."

Even the gulls circling overhead seemed to pause.\n- Today, I speak not as your president, but as your neighbour. A fellow Pomeranian. It is not by miracle nor mercy that we have come this far. It is by the labour of our shipbuilders, the hands of our farmers, the cunning of our engineers, and the unbreakable will of our people. In the dark hours- when the power failed, when food grew scarce, when all seemed lost - it was you, the ordinary men and women of West Pomerania, who held the line.\n\nHe looked up, his eyes sweeping across faces both hopeful and hard-worn.\n- But we did. By God, we did. After hardship, perseverance. After ruin, resolve. And now - after a long and bitter struggle- we stand at the dawn of a new chapter in our history. The trials were many, the road steep and strewn with obstacles, but we did not falter. We did not bend. And we did not break.\nCheers erupted - restrained, but heartfelt.\n\n- We rebuilt our shipyards with our own hands. We cleaned the Oder. We brought back heating to Kołobrzeg and rightful name to Stargard Szczeciński. Children no longer go to bed cold. Families once divided by desperation now sit together at tables piled high with bread, butter, and good paprikash. And while others squabble over scraps of the old country, we have forged something new. Something proud. We are not some breakaway, forgotten province. We are Szczecin reborn - the heart of the west, a stronghold of the future.\nNow the crowd was with him. Shouting. Whistling. Krzystek let it swell for a moment before lifting his hands.\n\n- But let us not be smug. There is still work to do. The South looks to us with envy- and with fear. Some would see our success twisted and our unity unraveled. But as long as I draw breath, I swear to you: this government, your government, shall serve you. Not foreign profiteers. Not self-appointed lords and barons. But the people - our people. We shall not be ruled from Berlin, nor dictated to by strangers bearing contracts in one hand and chains in the other. We are not the remnants of a failed republic - we are the living heart of the western lands, and we shall not rest until every Pole, from the Bug to the Oder, is free, fed, and flourishing under one banner once more.\n- So raise your glasses. Raise your hopes. And raise your children in a land where life isn't just tolerable - it's bloody brilliant! This day marks the beginning of a great new era for our city and our region! \nThe orchestra struck up the anthem. People stood.

szczecin.47.desc: "We called it a patrol, but it was never meant to be.\n\nEight of us moved single-file through the marshes somewhere north of Stare Drawsko, with muck sucking at our boots and rifles clenched in sweating hands. The rain hadn't stopped in days, and the fog was thick enough to choke. Somewhere above, a drone buzzed like a fly over a corpse, but in that damned wetland, eyes meant nothing. They were already watching us. I remember Sergeant Wilczek whispering, "Keep tight. Too quiet". That was a minute before his head exploded. Just gone. One second he was there, mouth open mid-word, and then he was a stump spraying pink mist.\n\nThen the world erupted. The Lizards hit us like ghosts, crawling from the water, the reeds, the goddamn trees. Camouflaged like moss and muck, their eyes gleamed behind homemade gas masks shaped like wolf snouts. The first volley of arrows and bullets cut down Janek and Bartek - Bartek didn't even scream, just slipped under the water like it was pulling him home. We fired blindly. Return fire in a foggy hell. A flamethrower lit up the mist, but all it caught was a tree - and then the tree caught us. Burning bark and screaming filled the air. I ran. I don't remember choosing to, but my legs moved. Beside me, Piotrek tripped and screamed as something dragged him by the ankle into the reeds. His scream cut off with a wet crunch.\n\nWe regrouped - what was left of us. Four out of eight. Dawid was muttering prayers between sobs. They didn't chase us. They hunted us. Slow. Patient. One by one. We'd see movement, open fire, then nothing but silence. And then, the howling. God-damned howling. Minutes later, we'd find another one gone. I saw Kazek go down to a pit lined with sharpened rebar - one moment he was there, then the ground swallowed him. We couldn't even pull him out. We tried.\n\nI crawled God knows how long on my stomach, drenched in blood and swamp water, until I hit the edge of the patrol perimeter. The extraction team found me, but I could only mutter about hell. Of eight, three came back breathing. One shot himself the next day. They called us soldiers of Szczecin, but we were just amateurs in old uniforms pretending to be someone we're not. And they, those freaks, those monsters, howling through the fog - were home in that place.\n\nWe called it a patrol. We were trespassing.\n\n And wolves don't forgive trespassers. Not anymore.

We remember well the chaos that engulfed our cities. However, we do not forget the sacrifices of Nordic peacekeepers who stood between our people and the abyss.\n\nBut now, the time has come for Poland to begin walking on its legs again. The people of Western Pomerania, like so many across this wounded country, yearn for true sovereignty, not just in theory, but in reality. Each foreign patrol that roams our lands, no matter how well-intentioned, is a reminder that our fate is not yet in our own hands.\n\nI do not write to demand, nor to accuse. I write to ask - not just for myself, but for the tens of thousands of Poles who still sing our national anthem quietly behind closed doors. Let us retake our place in the world, as a free and self-governing nation. Let our institutions grow without foreign scaffolding. Let us succeed or fail, for that is the only path to dignity.\n\nWe understand that your mission here was one of stability, not conquest. And now, with conditions slowly improving and local governance taking root once more, I humbly ask that you consider a structured and gradual withdrawal of NORDBAT forces from Polish territory. Let our citizens feel the burden and the privilege of freedom.\n\nIf we are to rebuild Poland, we must be allowed to do so on Polish terms.\n\nWith the deepest respect,\nPiotr Krzystek\nPresident of Szczecin\nProvisional Government of Szczecin "

That scoundrel, Piotr Krzystek.\n\nThe same man who, just a few years ago, had been nothing more than Tusk's loyal lapdog. Tusk had dismissed him with a single executive order when he became useless, erasing his influence as easily as wiping away a line in the sand.\nAnd now? That little man had returned. And not just to defy him - to destroy him.\nNo.\nHe could not allow that.\nHe would not be destroyed by someone like him.\n\nTusk's personalized Humvee rumbled through the vast, shadowy forests of Pomerania, its tyres grinding over the dirt roads like the last echoes of a fallen regime. One of his few remaining loyal soldiers sat at the wheel, tasked with delivering him to the German border - where familiar faces, old allies, awaited.\n\nHe sat in silence, eyes fixed ahead, but his mind was ablaze. The plan for revenge was already forming. He would regroup. He would return. And he would convince Ursula to intervene once more - but this time, it would succeed. This time, it would not be just a partial intervention. It would be a full-scale reclamation,  a political conquest of the entire country.\nAnd at the helm? Donald Tusk.\nNot as prime minister. No - as president.\nYes -  he thought, with a bitter smile forming - it is a great idea.\n\nJust as they made their way through the intersection, shots rang out. The windshield exploded into shards. The driver slumped forward, a bloom of red spread across his chest.\n\nThe Humvee swerved violently, tyres screaming against gravel before slamming into a pine tree with a bone-crunching thud.\n\nTusk jolted forward in his seat, dazed, ears ringing. Smoke hissed from under the hood. He pushed the door open and tumbled out, coughing, with blood streaking down his cheek. The forest around him was quiet again - too quiet.\nHe ran.\nHeart pounding, legs burning, he darted into the woods, adrenaline overriding pain. Branches tore at his coat, and brambles bit into his skin. Behind him, the sharp calls of soldiers and the barking of dogs pierced the forest air. He veered downhill, splashed through a shallow stream, and climbed a rocky slope - stumbling, gasping.\nFor a moment, the chase faded.\nHe collapsed behind a fallen tree, his chest heaving, mud covering his hands and blood drying on his face. He pulled a small radio from his coat, which had been broken in the crash. He cursed under his breath.\nWhen he heard the footsteps behind him, he knew it was already too late.\nA soldier rounded the tree. Tusk lunged, surprising him, knocking the rifle aside - but another soldier tackled him from behind. He hit the ground hard, cheek pressed into damp leaves. Hands wrenched behind his back, zip ties biting into his wrists.\n\nAs they dragged him away, bruised and beaten, Tusk turned his head toward the darkening horizon and whispered:\n"This is not the end. Someday, I will return.""

So countless, in fact, that it all began to blend together, leaving in mind only the most absurd, implausible or laughable incidents, listed below.\n\nIn order:\n\n- Infantry Battalion "Czynu Polskiego" - The battalion had begun letting people under the age of 15 fill in empty spaces in personnel. All responsible have since been punished.\n\n- Infantry Battalion "Fryga" - Massive material misuse scandal involving the battalion's ammo reserves being melted down into commemorative statuettes, sold at a gain for the battalion personnel. All responsible have been punished, and cooperating foundry has been fined severely.\n\n- Infantry Battalion "Kościuszko" - Equipment shortages forcing the soldiers to use farming equipment to train, including modified scythes. It was later discovered that the battalion leader, noted as a notorious fan of historical reenactments, purposefully refused equipment orders in order to be "closer to the spirit of the battalion", to the chagrin of his subordinates, while also facilitating the actions of battalion "Fryga". Punished.\n\n- Infantry Battalion "Most Długi" - Sappers of the battalion purposefully lead to the destruction of a bridge in the hometown of a local administrator, who refused to yield to the commander requisitioning provisions from the community. All involved were punished.\n\n- Infantry Battalion "Zamek" - Battalion intercepted supplies meant for battalion "Kościuszko" by force in order to deliver them to battalion "Fryga" for a cut of the profit.

Punished.\n\n- Świnoujście division of the Navy - An undisclosed "incident" occurred, which led to the sinking of one perfectly good craft, along with its crew. Commander punished. After further investigation, crew post-mortem dishonorably discharged.\n\n- The Red Griffons Air Force Squadron  - Pilots experienced an unrelenting need to do "barrel rolls", more often than not resulting in their deaths.\n\nReally?

Today was a special day as recent successful military reforms and conquests in the region were the occasion for remembrance and pride, marking it as the first of many yearly Victory Days. Attending crowds were met with a truly remarkable festival full with attractions and food, however the highlight of the celebrations was certainly the speech of President Piotr Krzystek followed by a grand parade of every branch of the Szczecinian military. The attention of the happy gathering was grabbed by the ringing bells, signalising noon. As the sound spread throught the city, the President followed by his personal security staff, made his way upon the speech pedestal, located in the middle of the Embankment, surrounded by plentiful flags of blue and red, with the pomeranian grififn upon them. As the ringing of bells died down, the air sounded with the Presidents voice coming from speakers spread across the Embankment, greeting the gathered crowds. \n - Greetings, my dear compatriots and welcome to the inaugural Victory Day! - Citizenry cheered tempestously in response. - Before I shall let our grand army impress us with their goosestep, I'd like to address you directly, as I addressed the parliament. We are facing enemies from all sides, but against this tyrannical assault against our freedom, we shall fight in the streets, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the sidewalks, we shall fight in the bogs, for Szczecin has nothing to offer, but sweat, toil, tears and blood! As we are faced with ordeal of most grievous kind we need to prepare ourselves for months of struggle and suffering. You may ask what's our policy in coming days, as we are faced by monstrous tyranny that would take away our freedom. Our policy is to never surrender to doubt and failure, and fight through land, air and sea, to protect what we fought so hard to attain. Yet there may be questions, what is the final goal of this struggle, and I shall answer with one word, victory - victory above all else, in spite of all adversities, in spite of all who oppose us and our way of life, victory against terror and tyranny, victory throughout all times, no matter how long the struggle lasts, for without victory, there may be no freedom, and without freedom, there may be no survival. \n Crowds have stood up in unison with ovations and jubilant cheers for Szczecin, as a squadron of military jets flew over the city, filling the sky with blue and red streaks of smoke. Soon after that, the parade was opened as flawlessly dressed soldiers from various units of the newly reorganised military entered the embankment accompanied by various, armoured vehicles, tanks, trucks and self propelled artillery. With the spectacle in full swing, the navy joined the fray, as several vessels bearing the pomeranian griffin flag sailed by via the Odra river. With the Victory Day Parade proceeding as planned, President Krzystek smiled upon his, now fully fledged military, ready to defend the freedom of his new Republic."

I'd like to hear out both sides on to whom shall we bestow the titles, as these shall be lifelong positions for those who went above and beyond for our country. \n - Mr. President, fellow Parlimentaries. - The chairman of The Castle, Zbigniew Bogucki stood up and looked around the room before proceeding. - Within the party, we've come to a consensus, that Protector titles should be awarded to those who, as name suggests, protected our nation. We've worked closely with the Veteran and Combatant Union which unites those Szczecinians who fought and bled during our fight for freedom, those without whom we wouldn't be able to hold this debate in the first place. - The right side of the hall rose up in applause, but the left side was left unamused. \n - I can certainly see where you're coming from with this stance, Mr. Bogucki. - President nodded, then looked to his left. - Mr. Jaroszewicz, what does the Summer Union say to that? \n Bogdan Jaroszewicz, the chairman of the Summer Union sat at the helm of the left side of the hall, upon being called out he fixed his glasses and stood up. \n - Mr. President, within the Summer Union we do join in with The Castle, veterans of the rebellion are to be highly respected and valued, that is of course certain, however we postulate, that the titles of Protectors should be given to those that fill the hearts and minds of our people with hope and ambition. - He gestured towards his comembers on the red side of the Parliment. - We stand behind those who form the unflinching spirit of Szczecin, the educated professors, scientists, lawyers and statesmen - the "inteligentsia" as our conservative counterpart might call them, as without them, our magnificent region would be nothing more than an empty shell with no purpose or goal. - Summer Union, in nigh unison applauded their Chairman, however one person sitting on the far left side of the hall clapped somewhat disinterestingly. \n - That is an excellent counterpoint, Mr. Jaroszewicz, without the educated, our people would be lost, it's certainly a fair point to say that they should have a greater say in politics of our state. - President looked to the lady clad in crimson red, sitting on the far left end of the room. - Madame Margaret, would you like to add something to the proposal of your party? \n - Thank you Mr. President. - Margaret nodded, giving her chairman a side-eye. - The talk of spirit and minds, at least to me, can't be complete without the revolutionaries - artists and writers, those who truly ignited the flames of rebellion against our occupants, the people who filled our citizens hearts with hopes and dreams during the darkest of days! \n Debate soon devolved into politicians from left and right screaming over each other and in the thick of it all, sat President Krzystek deep in thought about whose proposal he's willing to accept."

Yet, here he was, waiting i his former apartment for transport to the German border.\n\nHe knew nothing was waiting for him there. His failures sealed his fate; no one would ever trust him with real power again. To his people, he was a disgrace, the man who had lost the city that had begun to feel German once more. And yet, to his surprise, he didn't care.\nLeadership had never truly suited Christian. He was never seen as the ideal chairman of the Free Democratic Party, nor a particularly capable Eurogovernor of Szczecin. That was his exit, his chance to leave behind the cesspit of politics for good. He could live in a small home in Wuppertal, do gardening, and enjoy life. A peace he had longed for many years.\n\n His daydreaming was cut short by a sharp, persistent knock at the door. When he opened it, two Griffin soldiers stood before him.\n"Your transport is ready," one of them said. "It's time."\n\nWithout a word, Christian picked up the small handbag containing the few belongings he was permitted to take. He took the last glance at the apartment in central Szczecin, once his home, now just another space waiting for another citizen to live in, and stepped out into the corridor, leaving it all behind.\n\nChristian sat silently in the back seat as the car rolled through Szczecin. The city was already settling into its rhythms, but the scars of the revolution were still raw, shattered windows, scorched walls, and streets that remembered too much. So many had died for nothing, clinging to a cause that had been lost long before the first shots were fired.\nYet something had changed. The usual gloom that clung to Szczecin seemed to have lifted. People looked lighter, freer, almost happy. It was then that Lindner realized, with bitter clarity, that he had been the villain in their story all along, not any officer or soldier, but him.\nAfter a brief drive, they reached the Lubieszyn-Linken border crossing. To Lindner's surprise, Piotr Krzystek was already there, waiting. On the other side, a small unit of German soldiers stood in formation, ready to receive and take him somewhere only they knew. Lindner stepped out of the car and walked toward the crossing. But just before the threshold, he paused. Turning back, he met Krzystek's gaze, steady, unreadable.\n"Danke schön" Lindner said softly. Then he turned, crossed the border, and nodded to his German comrades. Without ceremony, he climbed into the waiting vehicle and disappeared toward Berlin.

A miracle had arrived: the city unveiled its brand-new, imported double-decker bus - straight from England. It gleamed. It hummed. It promised urban elegance. At the bus stop, the citizens watched the double-decker with a mix of awe and confusion. Some took selfies. Others wondered aloud if they needed a passport to board. The mood itself was almost festive. That is, until she arrived.\n\nBalbina.\nLocals called her that, but her real name was Bogumiła. A name that once meant "God-loving," but in the public transport circles of Szczecin, it meant "shift-ending disaster."\nShe revved her electric mobility scooter with a warrior's resolve, clutching her trusty handbag like a sword forged from synthetic leather. The tires screeched against the tile of the stairwell as she descended, causing two cats to evacuate the building in terror. Nothing, nothing, would stop her from reaching the upper deck of that beautiful crimson steed.\n\n- Excuse me! -  Bogumiła bellowed, weaving through the crowd like a runaway tractor. - This is public transport, is it not?! PUBLIC! Which means I demand access to the royal seats! Upstairs!\nThe bus driver, a pale man who regretted transferring from his corporate job at Police, stared at her with dead fish eyes.\n- Ma'am, the ramp can't support your scooter. We can't even get you through the lower entrance.\n- Then why does it have a top deck? You think it's there just for kids and yuppies with working knees? It's discrimination! It's antisocial behavior! It's treason!\n\nShe charged forward, scooter humming like an angry microwave, and wedged herself into the bus's lower deck entrance. The ramp groaned. The door beeped helplessly. If she couldn't get into the bus, she would make sure that the bus can't leave. She drove in front of the bus and with a self-content smirk stopped there with her arms unfolded like it was Tiananmen Square. Within minutes, the situation escalated. Buses backed up. Traffic mounted up. News crews arrived. Bogumiła's face, distorted with righteous fury, was broadcast across the region like a warning from the gods. She refused to move. Not for the president. Not for the archbishop. Not even for the bribe of free senior passes for life. An hour passed. And then came the sirens. Two police cars pulled up with the lethargy of men who had seen too much. Officer Czajka and Sergeant Rogowski stepped out, stared at the familiar figure blocking civilization once again, and let out synchronized sighs that could have powered a wind farm.\n- Oh God, not again...\n- THIS CITY WON'T MOVE UNTIL I CAN!\n- I'll be hearing this fucking scooter in my dreams forever...- sighed officer Czajka and called for backup. If there will be someone stupid enough to help fix this shitshow."

szczecin.59.t: "A Really Bad Dream"
szczecin.59.desc: "The city was burning. Piotr Krzystek and his guards were at the last stand of the Szczecin. They were protecting the city hall at all costs. Outside, the Germans have already gathered, with tanks and artillery ready to turn the last governing entity of the country to dust. At the helm stood Christian Lindner alongside Donald Tusk, happy and prepared to take over everything he had accomplished over the past years. Krzystek froze; he could only watch fate striking his beloved republic like mischievous thunder. Then, the traitors gave the orders to attack. He watched as tanks rolled into the hall, destroying the last stand of defiance.\n\nThe vivid dream had startled him awake. Drenched in sweat, he jumped out of bed in fear. The dream felt too real - Piotr truly experienced everything that happened. He knew he could not allow that to happen again, not after everything they had done to ensure the security and liberty of the Pomeranian citizens. There must be a person who can protect and guide this nation through any circumstances to prevent it from collapsing again. But what should he do?\n\nCalling Professor Toszek, his trusted colleague, seemed like a good starting point. No one else possessed the necessary knowledge and experience to provide solid advice on what Krzystek should do. It did not matter to him that Toszek was probably still asleep; he needed to know - now. He picked up the phone after a couple of minutes and a lot of unanswered calls.\n\n- Mr President, has something happened?! - he said with a sleepy, although concerned voice.\n\n- I know this might sound crazy, and you may think I am delusional, but I believe something is seriously wrong. Our country could face a significant threat in the future that might be impossible to stop unless we have someone who can rise above the political disagreements and infighting. We need a strong leader, someone who can be our Cincinnatus, someone who would prioritize the nation's interests over their own. We must address this, and I do not know what to do. Could you please offer me some advice?\n\n- I have been contemplating an idea for quite some time. You, Mr President, could be the person to fulfil it. How, you might ask? You could become a king. I know how unusual this sounds, but please allow me to explain. A king could serve as a unifying figure for our entire country, guiding people toward a better future. We are not discussing a delusional autocrat, but rather a ruler similar to those in Britain but a man of the people. Please, consider it, Piotr.\n\n- How would the people react? The government? Everyone? Am I even truly the best person for that position? - Krzystek said with uncertainty.\n\n- Let's approach it this way. First, we need to address the government. After that, we can brainstorm our next steps. Do not worry, my friend; I have a plan. We need to take everything one step at a time. So, are you on board?"

szczecin.60.desc: "For Stargard Szczeciński, it was a big day. The Summer Union was having an electoral meeting there, and all the attention was on Jaroszewicz. Going back and forth, answering important questions that would surely weigh on his chances of winning. Just as he was finishing one of many interviews, he uttered those fateful words:\n\n- ...And remember! We're the party of the common man! We want nothing but to make your lives better!\n\nAnd that just seemed to summon... him. A poor-looking man, wearing off-brand clothes, his face blazing with the rage of someone who's been ignored and diminished for far too long. Just as Jaroszewicz finished, he rushed in, with the battlecry of \"BULLSHIIIIT!\", his fist raised and ready. The candidate had just enough time to lean back, shock painted on his face, to dodge the fist, which ended up contacting the cheek of one of the interviewers. Quickly, the worker turned around and began shouting at the top of his lungs.\n\n- OH REALLY NOW? You \"want nothing but to make our life better\", huh? Well, let's just take me for an example. I work at a Netto, barely making enough money to put decent food on my fucking table, in horrible conditions that would have any government with a shred of conscience classify you as worse than North fucking Korea, and what does the temporary government do? JACKSHIT! Oh, and one more thing, you've got active contacts in the Hansa and are exploiting them to get better terms from them! You hear that, folks! The government's partnering with the Hansa! THE GOVERNMENT ARE A BUNCH OF FUCKING BLOODSUCKERS-\n\nThat was the last he could utter before getting dragged away out of hearing range by security. If it were Jaroszewicz's call, he would likely let him off on lower charges. He was, after all, just the voice of a people worked nearly to death, which kept the Szczecinian economy running with their blood, sweat and tears. He thought for a while about what to say in light of the attempt, before turning to whatever remaining microphones there were after the incident. People were curious what he had to say, and this might be a good opportunity to convince people he's not just some bloodsucking politmagnate.\n\n- Well, regarding that... I must say that..."

szczecin.61.t: "Silk or Cashmere?"
szczecin.61.desc: "Why was it so important?\n\nHis advisors had been relentless - tailors summoned from Łódź and even farther away, with endless samples across the council room table: French silk, Tyrolean wool, the finest Silesian linen, and imported cashmere smuggled through uncertain borders. They argued loudly and endlessly over threads and textures, collars and cuffs, gold or silver embroidery. They spoke with urgency as if the fate of the realm hinged on whether the King's cape was lined with sable or ermine.\nKrzystek sat through it all in silence.\nHe did not understand why it mattered. The country still bore the scars of occupation and collapse. Some streets had no power, and fuel was being rationed. Entire towns looked like frozen ruins from another era. And here they were, arguing over the shade of blue most befitting royalty.\n\n- Perception is everything -  one advisor said, waving a swatch of violet cloth like a flag.\n- The people must see strength, elegance, legitimacy - not austerity. Not compromise.\n\nBut Krzystek knew what they really meant: the King must look like a King. They were afraid the moment might slip away, that the illusion might crack.\n\nThey feared that the old world, still breathing beneath the surface, might awaken and pull them back into chaos. The coronation had to be perfect. A single misstep, a wrinkle, a sign of doubt, and it would be over.\nThe crown would mean nothing. Worse, it would be mocked.\n\nStill, Krzystek could not shake the unease.\n\nHe remembered the workers in the shipyards, the food queues, and the quiet resilience of Szczecin's people. They did not need a silk-clad king. They needed fuel, bread, dignity, and stability.\nAnd yet, here he was, being measured for a robe.\nHe looked at himself in the mirror as the tailor pinned fabric across his shoulders. The reflection did not look regal; it looked tired. The man in the mirror had too many sleepless nights behind his eyes, too many compromises, and too much silence where words should have been.\n\nWhy was this so important?\n\nBecause the kingdom they were trying to build was not yet a reality. Not completely. It existed only in the minds of the hopeful and the desperate. It needed symbols, clothing, ceremonies, bells, flags, and a king who appeared to fit the role, even if he did not truly feel it.\n\nAfter much thought, he made his final decision."

szczecin.62.t: "Con(vincing) Man"
szczecin.62.desc: "The Voice of Pomerania of [GetDate]\n\nHello, citizens of Pomerania!\n\nIn today's broadcast, I bring you special news from the presidential palace. Our long-time president, Piotr Krzystek, has made a surprising decision to become the king of Pomerania. While this may seem unsettling, Krzystek does not intend to take full power for himself. His proclamation aims to ensure fairness and clarity within our democratic system. Transitioning from a president to a constitutional monarch would strengthen our state institutions and allow for intervention in critical situations where our parliament is unable to reach a sensible agreement.\n\nSome may view this as a betrayal of our republic. However, has Piotr Krzystek ever let down the citizens of Pomerania? He risked his life fighting for the freedom of every Szczecinian during Lindner's occupation. Throughout the countless sleepless nights of the unification wars, he planned successful campaigns and cared for the lives of people in the pre-liberated lands. Furthermore, Piotr never exhibited any signs of a hunger for power or a negative attitude. He was always there for us. That is why if anyone deserves to become king, it is him.\n\nWith Piotr Krzystek, we can be confident that our freedom and independence will be safeguarded. He will protect us from any dangers that may threaten our young country. Now, the president himself would like to assure everyone and send his greetings to our listeners!\n\n- Hello, citizens of Pomerania! That is your president, Piotr Krzystek, speaking. As you may know, my closest advisors and I have decided to transition our republican system to a constitutional monarchy. You might wonder why I, a devoted supporter of democracy, have chosen to make this change to our Constitution and the fundamental principles of our state. The reason is that our country has lacked a leader to guide and oversee this democratic system. I must admit that I do not see myself as the most suitable person for that role. In fact, my close friend, Professor Toszek, has encouraged me to take on the position of king. As your monarch, I promise to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law. While I may not be the best, I assure you that I will do my best to protect the Kingdom of Pomerania. With the utmost respect, your loyal servant, Piotr of House Krzystek.\n\nWhen Piotr Krzystek's pre-recorded speech finished airing, the two soldiers behind the reporter exchanged a subtle nod. Everything had unfolded as expected, and the reporter could now look forward to a modest raise in his salary. "
szczecin.62.a: "Everything for the country."

szczecin.63.t: "Jewels of Pomerania"
szczecin.63.desc: "Piotr Krzystek wandered slowly through the park of Jasne Błonie, his hands folded behind his back, deep in thought. The late afternoon sun cast golden rays across the hedges, and the faint scent of lilacs filled the air, but he barely noticed. His mind was preoccupied with one matter of great importance: his coronation.\n\nHe had carefully considered every detail. It could not be too lavish - there was no room in the budget for gilded palanquins or imported silk banners. That was not some fantasy empire but a fragile, rebuilding republic. At the same time, it could not be too modest either. He refused to allow history to remember his ascension as some uninspired, poorly staged affair in a town square. No, it had to exude dignity, gravitas, and symbolism. That was the moment when he would become not just a leader but a monarch, the King of Pomerania.\n\nAs he turned the corner of a neatly trimmed hedge, a sudden thought struck him with force: he did not have any royal regalia.\n\nHe stopped walking, staring blankly at the gravel path beneath his feet. No crown. No sceptre, orb, or ceremonial sword. Nothing. How could he become king without the symbols that defined royalty? What kind of monarch rules without the trappings of power? Could he truly stand before his people and declare himself king with empty hands and a borrowed coat?\n\nIt was absurd. Embarrassing, even. The ceremony could be planned to perfection, the speeches rehearsed, the setting adorned with historical pomp, but without the regalia, it would all seem like a hollow performance - a costume play without a costume.\n\nHe grabbed his forehead feeling the weight of the moment settle heavily on his shoulders. For a brief second, he wondered if this was a sign, a warning that he was moving too fast or aiming too high. But he dismissed that thought almost immediately. He had come too far. He had built too much.\n\nWhat should he do? He could order a crown from the finest goldsmith, but that felt rather uninteresting for a future king. Perhaps a visit to the castle would spark some creative ideas. As he left the gardens, Piotr finally decided what he would do next."
szczecin.63.a: "A new crown does not sound too bad."
szczecin.63.b: "A visit to the castle is a great idea."

szczecin.64.t: "The Residence"
szczecin.64.desc: "Piotr Krzystek wandered through the echoing halls of the Castle of the Pomeranian Princes, his footsteps soft against the freshly polished stone floors. The ceilings soared above like the hulls of ships turned upside down - grand, ancient, and impossibly silent. Newly restored tapestries hung on the walls beside armorers and gilt-framed portraits of long-dead dukes. The past lingered in every corridor.\n\nKrzystek could not shake the feeling that he was trespassing. He missed his old office - a compact, utilitarian space where every book, map, and file had its designated spot. The city hall had a familiar scent of coffee and dust, embodying the daily life of governance. In contrast, everything in the castle reeked of ceremony, polish, old stone, and obligations.\n\nOutside, work crews bustled about, preparing for the most ambitious coronation the city had seen in centuries. Red carpets were being laid across the inner courtyards. Royal guards practiced their salutes in formation beneath the towering windows. Painters touched up ceilings that had gone unnoticed for generations. Clergymen and party officials whispered to each other about seating arrangements. In the background, bells rang at intervals, signaling the passing of hours or perhaps the final days of the republic.\n\nThe castle had once belonged to the princes of Griffin blood, rulers of medieval Pomerania. Now, it was being reborn as a palace of kings.\nAnd yet, Krzystek felt small within its walls.\n\nHe told himself that this was history in the making. His coronation would signify the rebirth of order, identity, and pride. The people needed a monarch, a symbol, a man with a crown, and a vision. He had agreed on that, and now there was no possibility of a way out.\n\nHe felt both happy and proud as he waited for the coronation, filled with tense anticipation. However, tonight, as the wind whispered through the grand glass windows and shadows gathered in the corners too old to remember the light, Piotr Krzystek wondered: Had he rebuilt the monarchy, or had it consumed him entirely?

szczecin.65.desc: "Finally, after a long series of electoral meetings and... whatever that incident with the Netto worker was, Jaroszewicz was glad to be back home... well, back in the Summer Union headquarters on John Paul II street, at least. This building once used to belong to the Civic Platform, but now it was the home of something much more regional. Now, after the loud events came time to address the concerns of the voters more... privately, mostly through letters.\nFirst up was a letter from Frania Lubińska:\n\nDear Mr. Jaroszewicz.\nMy husband Edmund, quite a while ago, got into a serious accident at a PŻM shipyard he worked at. An open fracture, and several closed ones. He didn't want us to go into debt, since he couldn't pay the hospital bill with his meager earnings, so\nI had to bid him farewell. I believe it's your responsibility as the \"party of the people\" to look at cases like this and act! Please, Mr. Jaroszewicz. People like me are counting on you.\n\n...okay, a bit gloomy... how about the next one? From Jan Dobrowolski:\n\nDear Mr. Jaroszewicz.\nI work at the Chemiewerke Politz. I feel that should be enough to already raise some concerns, but it's not what I'm here to complain about. Instead, my problem is that I have a sick mother I need to support with the scraps I'm given! This is madness! Can't we have at least SEMI-public healthcare to help people like her? Please, Mr. Jaroszewicz. I'm really worried for her\n\nOkay, Jaroszewicz was beginning to get the point. People were worried about healthcare. That wasn't exactly news, but it was a good observation to make. What he said here could seriously help his chances of getting elected and potentially making a change on the subject... but at the same time, it could get him in deadly trouble with the Hansa.  He had to think really clearly about this.\n\nHe picked up a piece of paper and a pen and began to write in response to the two letters... but what should he write?"

szczecin.66.t: "The Grand Coronation"
szczecin.66.desc: "Thousands of people gathered in front of the Castle of the Pomeranian Princes, eagerly awaiting the first Polish coronation in over 400 years. Once again, a king would rule the lands of Pomerania and, hopefully, one day, all of Poland. The crowd cheered and buzzed with anticipation, scanning every road for the first glimpse of the royal carriage. Guards stood tall, cloaked in ceremonial uniforms, vigilant for any threat that could jeopardize the king's safety. Protectors and members of parliament waited in tense silence, witnessing the birth of a new chapter in their country's history.\n\nMeanwhile, Krzystek rode through the heart of Szczecin, gazing out at his subjects with a mixture of pride and awe. The streets were draped in red and white banners, and people lined the roads to catch a glimpse of their would-be monarch. Children waved flags, elders crossed themselves quietly, and many stood in silence, overwhelmed by the gravity of the moment.\n\nThough he smiled and waved, inside, Piotr Krzystek was consumed by reflection. His big day had arrived, and he could not deny the heaviness in his chest. In just a few hours, he would be transformed from president to king, a symbol, a figurehead, a guiding hand. He had given orders in crises and drafted laws in peacetime, but this was different. Now, the soul of the nation would be tied to his name. The people would look to him not merely for leadership but for hope, continuity, and meaning.\n\nThe royal carriage reached the gates of the Castle of the Pomeranian Princes just as the noon bells tolled across the city. The vast courtyard fell silent as Krzystek stepped out, adorned in a tailored ceremonial coat. His crown waited inside, alongside the ornate sceptre and mantle. He climbed the stairs slowly, with quiet dignity, his boots echoing across the stone.\n\nInside the grand hall, filled with golden light and centuries of history, the Bishop of Szczecin awaited him beneath the vaulted ceiling. Krzystek kneeled at the altar, head bowed.\n\n- Do you swear to serve the people of Pomerania with justice, humility, and unwavering resolve?" - the Bishop asked, holding the ceremonial Bible in his hand.\n- I do, - Krzystek answered, with his voice steady but low.\nThe Bishop lifted the crown and, after a moment of profound silence, placed it upon Krzystek's head.\n- Then rise, Piotr I, by the grace of God and the will of the people, King of Pomerania.\n\nApplause erupted within the hall and, moments later, across the courtyard. The bells of the city rang with ferocious joy. Fireworks cracked in the sky, and the crowd outside chanted his name: Krzystek! Krzystek! Krzystek! Overcome with emotion, he stepped onto the balcony overlooking the square and raised a hand in solemn greeting.\n\nThe cheers were deafening. Yet for Krzystek, standing beneath the banner of a new kingdom, the weight of the crown was both literal and eternal. He knew there would be doubt, criticism, perhaps even rebellion. But at that moment, as sunlight spilt over the castle, there was only clarity.\n\nPomerania had a king again. And with that, a future worth fighting for. "

The police, bolstered with new security initiatives and an overinflated budget, began a crackdown on the many gangs and petty criminals who spread widely across the city, as the troubled period of post-insurrection rebuilding continued. Within one of the decrepit tenement buildings, a grizzled hooligan looked through a gap in the closed curtains, as apartments across the street were raided by the police.\n- This ain't looking great - he muttered to himself, grasping the Pogoń Szczecin scarf wrapped around his neck.\nAnd just like the scarf on his neck, the noose was being tightened by the police on any and all criminals, from the petty thieves to gang bosses.\n- Ey boss. - he heard a voice coming into the room. \n- Shut up you daft cunt. - Boss hissed back. - If they hear us, we're so fucked. \n- Oh come on, they won't get us, it's not like we covered our entire apartment floor with graffiti, right? \nThe boss slowly turned to face his mate. \n- We covered the door with graffiti, didn't we. - The underling continued, realising the grim situation they found themselves in. \n- I thought it will look cool, Niebko Terror and all yknow. -  The boss turned to look through the curtain again. - It's fine, the cops are... not there anymo- \nAs he was about to finish his sentence, a loud thump sounded through the door. Then another one, accompanied by dangerously creaky sounds of the door frame giving way.\n- This is the police! Get down on the ground and surrender! - The assaulting officers brought out a buzzsaw and began to cut the hinges of the door. The criminals started to panic, running around the apartment grabbing anything they could to arm themselves - baseball bats, chairs, flower vases, pots and pans, anything.\n- This is your final warning, surrender now! - An officer shouted, then the door gave, several flashbang grenades rolled on the floor - and all hell broke loose. As the hooligans fell to the floor, blinded and deafened, the police assault began shooting rubber buckshot from their service shotguns taking down the few still standing with top notch precision. \n- Dude, he was mine! - one of the assault officers, clad in body armour shouted at another, while stowing his weapon. \n- Should've shot him first then. - the latter responded, while cocking his shotgun. \n- Quit rambling boys, and take this scum outside, we're far from done. - a female investigation officer wearing a spotless uniform followed the team inside stepping over the unconscious scum.\n\nIn a matter of hours, the entire district was cleared and police vans were full of criminals."

The government car rolled quietly through the southern districts, cutting across Międzyodrze, then into Prawobrzeże, where the city thinned out into concrete veins and gray overpasses. The driver said nothing. Neither did Bogucki.\nOutside, the city passed like a newsreel, familiar, yet increasingly unreal.\nAs they crossed Trasa Zamkowa, he glanced out the window. Under the bridge, at the base of the embankment, was a cluster of blue tarps and scavenged boards. Smoke rose from a steel barrel. Someone moved slowly between makeshift walls, wrapped in blankets even though it wasn't cold.\nHe frowned. No one had told him this had gotten so visible.\nFurther down, under Estakada Pomorska, more shelters. Pieces of old billboards nailed into triangles. Rusted shopping carts. Children.\nBy the time they passed over the Pioneers' Bridge, he had counted at least five such encampments. Each one larger than the last.\nPeople were living there. Not just squatting, living.\nHe said nothing for a long moment.\nThen, quietly, more to himself than to his aide in the passenger seat: -This isn't just decay. This is collapse.-\nThe aide looked straight ahead, uncertain whether to agree.\nBogucki leaned back in his seat. He was on his way to Kołobrzeg, to give another speech. Another promise.\nBut what could he say now?\nThe government couldn't manage this. Not alone. It would have to ask for help. And that meant turning to the Hanseatic guild, the same commercial bloc they had tried to keep at a distance. The same one that had turned agriculture into a balancing act of debt and dependency.\nAsking them for help with internal homelessness? With housing? With dignity?\nThat would be a headache.\nAnd what would it even mean, to promise this to the voters? That we will fix it, but not by ourselves? That even Poland has its limits?\nHe watched the river slide past between the spans of steel. The road stretched ahead, clean and empty.\nSomewhere beyond it, the crowd was already waiting."

szczecin.69.desc: "When he entered the palace, Piotr Krzystek felt an inexplicable sensation. A strange force compelled him to explore the underground section of his future residence. He was drawn there by something greater than mere curiosity about the castle. He believed the answers he sought would be found in the catacombs. Although these areas were mostly unexplored and renovations were ongoing, work ceased when Poland collapsed. The structures were unstable, and he was aware of the risks involved in descending the stairs. Nevertheless, something inside him urged him forward, convinced that the key to finding his jewels lay below.\n\nPiotr spent hours down in the catacombs, searching for something he couldn't quite identify. He knew that people would likely start looking for him soon, and it would feel strange to return and explain that he had ventured into the catacombs because of a peculiar feeling that he might find something there. When he finally decided to leave, he leaned against the wall to rest for a moment.\n\nSuddenly, a wall behind him shifted. Krzystek watched in amazement as a long-forgotten chamber opened right before his eyes. When the darkroom revealed itself, he stood there for a couple of minutes, unable to believe what he was seeing. He knew, deep down, that something awaited him inside. But what could it be?\n\nHis flashlight illuminated the secret room. The design suggested that it had remained untouched since the medieval era when the Griffin princes ruled this land. In the centre stood a cabinet covered by a sheet. Piotr approached it and removed the covering. What he saw was something he could never have imagined.\n\nThe untouched, lost crown of the Pomeranian princes gleamed with gold before his eyes. At that moment, Krzystek felt a deep connection to his kingship. This room had remained unexplored for centuries; no one had ever discovered it until he stumbled upon it just before his coronation. It felt like a sign from the gods. Perhaps he was destined for this role as if becoming a king was his birthright. Could he be a descendant of the Griffins?\n\nHe carefully picked up the crown and placed it on his head. It was neither too heavy nor too light for him to wear. It felt just like a crown is meant to. It fit him perfectly.\n\nWith confidence, he left the catacombs. As he emerged from the dark, he stumbled upon his fellow guards. When they saw him in a beautiful crown, their questions about his whereabouts immediately stopped. Without much thought, they knelt and shouted:"
