unification.155.t: "[GetNewspaper]Decimal State unifies the Lublin Voivodeship!"
unification.155.desc: "Unsettling news is reaching us from the peripheral Lubelskie region. The entire voivodeship is said to have fallen under the control of Tadeusz Sznuk's peculiar government. The basis of the state's unusual political system is the "One of the Ten" TV trivia show hosted by Sznuk for the past three decades. This alone would be bizarre enough, but the reports claim that instead of peace developing in the region, the population of the so-called Decimal State is being subjected to increasingly extreme repressions. Its citizens are being routinely forced to take part in trivia contests, and failures to correctly answer the questions result in harsh punishments, with some rumors even saying that low enough scores occasionally lead to summary executions. Concerns grow, with the people unsure of how exactly Sznuk, a famously well-mannered gentleman, ended up establishing such a twisted system, but given this overtly cruel persecution, his increasing power is certainly worrying."
