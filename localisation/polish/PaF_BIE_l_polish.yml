unification.116.t: "[GetNewspaper]Bielany jednoczą Dystrykt Stołeczny!"
unification.116.desc: "Totalitarian regimes were an expected outcome of Poland's collapse, especially amongst those more cynical. However grim or outlandish the expectations of those observing the situation from the outside might've been, news emerging from the city of Warsaw has stunned everyone equally. Dawid Podsiadło, a singer and, as of a few years ago, the charismatic leader of the Bielany Union of Feminists, announced his group's successful seizure of Warsaw and its surrounding provinces. His state champions the abolition of the patriarchy and a unique economic “Small-Town System,” meant to destroy the big cities' hegemony on power within the nation. Podsiadło's clique preaches and enforces progressive and feminist values with the help of a relentless militia known as the Pink Shirts. Not hesitant to squash any opposition, Podsiadło claims that tolerance, European values, and true equality befit only a strongman, not just any passive protester."
