unification.185.t: "[GetNewspaper]Kaszëbskô Jednota jednoczy Pomorze Gdańskie!"
unification.185.desc: "Kashubia - until recently a more than willing pawn of the European project, has now set Pomerelia on a drastically different course, charted by a fringe nationalist organization in opposition to both Berlin and Warsaw. While the supremacist ideas of Jednota have long been widely known to the region's population, until the invasion, the institution has failed to establish itself as even a minor thorn in the side of the Polish government. But, with Kashubia's disgraceful collaboration bringing disaffected masses into the throes of nationalistic sentiment, the previously wilting culture managed to successfully ride the wave of its resurgence all the way to Pomerelia's subjugation. Now that they've reclaimed their historic territory, Jednota's goons inherit it populated by an overwhelming Polish majority of questionable loyalty, sparking calls to either forcefully integrate them into Kashubian traditions or even expel them from the region outright, whatever the cost of such action may be."

KSC_kaszebe_dla_kaszebow: "Kaszëbë dlô Kaszëbów"
