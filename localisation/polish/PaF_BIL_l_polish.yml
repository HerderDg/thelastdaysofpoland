unification.12.desc: "New reports have come in from the Eastern reaches of Poland. After months of local conflicts, it appears that the entire Lublin Voivodeship is now under the control of the Biłograj Breweries - a corporate state ruled by a wealthy, eccentric businessman - Janusz Palikot.\n\nPalikot is mainly remembered as a controversial, socially progressive politician most prominent in the 2010s, before he left the political scene to focus on his alcohol-related businesses. When the Polish state collapsed into anarchy, he used his wealth and influence to gain control of the region around his hometown, Biłgoraj. Yet even though many consider him to be primarily driven by the expansion of his company and personal power, reports credit Palikot with consistently introducing many socially progressive policies in his territory, like allowing gay marriage and seemingly encouraging atheism among the population."
