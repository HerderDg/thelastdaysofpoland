unification.83.t: "[GetNewspaper]Metropolia Bydgoska jednoczy Kujawy!"
unification.83.desc: "Recent news reports from Kuyavia indicate an outcome that aligns with most experts' pre-war predictions. The industrial and populational advantage held by the region's largest city, untouched by the invasion nor the instability that followed, proved far too much for the surrounding warlords to defend against. The victory of Bydgoszcz's liberal-aligned administration likely signifies the reinforcement of the status quo in the voivodeship, save for a few worrying details. The reveal of Bruski's planned collaboration with the EU forces has permanently tarnished the president's reputation, leaving him an enemy of much of the political scene. The unrest that rocked the metropolis, and especially the harsh crackdowns that followed have eroded the population's faith in their institutions. A crack spreads across the pristine democratic façade, deepening with each day that preventive 'anti-insurgent' measures remain in place."
unification.83.a: "W miejscu radości obojętność jest rozczarowaniem."

unification.207.t: "[GetNewspaper]Sacre Coeur Bidgostie jednoczy Kujawy!"
unification.207.desc: "Historically, Bydgoszcz has usually been regarded as Kuyavia's liberal stronghold, yet the news of Bruski's attempted defection to the European Union's invading forces ignited a fury within the city's inhabitants that altered everything it has come to be known for. Though the metropolis has exerted control over the voivodeship, the region has been conquered not by a mild-mannered democracy but by an almost fascistic clerical state led by the controversial preacher Roman Kneblewski. While the priest had previously been pushed to the absolute fringes of the Church for his numerous controversial diatribes, this outspokenness allowed him to topple the city's government with the help of fiercely nationalistic elements. Mandatory mass attendance and frequent raids by the so-called 'Guardians of Morality' are only some of the drastic changes felt by Kuyavia's citizens as the region's liberties slip to contort to a schismatic's archaic vision of a purer faith."
unification.207.a: "Iudica me, Deus..."

unification.208.t: "[GetNewspaper]Metropolia Bydgoska jednoczy Kujawy!"
unification.208.desc: "In every corner of Kuyavia, in the furthest reaches of war-torn Poland, through firsthand knowledge or distorted overheard stories, confused voices clamor: PiS is back! The chairman is back! Yet something is not right, for the man clinging to Kaczyński's legacy is merely a cheap impersonation of the long-missing politician. The familiar rhetoric that pushed the country forward for the past decade is still there, almost unchanged in its blunt directness, but the message behind it feels different; as if a mockery of the values it has come to represent. While the party's traditional base regards "The Chairman" with warm nostalgia for the better days under the PiS government, most pundits recommend careful skepticism towards the new state's intentions. With subtle liberal undertones carefully interwoven into the supposedly conservative messaging, the character might end up being far more than just a simple imitation."
unification.208.a: "Dziedzictwo PiSu spala się od wewnątrz."

super.83.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.83.a: "United at last."
