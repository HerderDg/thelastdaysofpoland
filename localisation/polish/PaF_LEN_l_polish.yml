unification.154.t: "[GetNewspaper]Plemie Lędzian jednoczy województwo Lubelskie!"
unification.154.desc: "As the regional armed conflicts for control of Lubelskie died down, an unlikely contender seems to have come up on top. The voivodeship is now controlled by a tribe-like society that claims to be descendant from Lendians. They were a West Slavic pagan tribe that lived around that region during the Early Middle Ages, before they were conquered and integrated by the Polans during the process of Christianization and consolidation of the newly formed Polish state.\n\nThe enigmatic leader of Lendians is simply known as Chief Lubel. He claims to be a successor of the pagan Lendian ruler of the same same, who supposedly founded the city of Lublin, which apparently was originally known as Lubelin. Historians consider such theories to be highly speculative at best, and yet the tribal government uses them to justify cracking down on Christianity and \"Piastist influences\" on their newly conquered territories."
