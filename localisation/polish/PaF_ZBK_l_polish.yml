super.196.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"
super.196.desc: "Years have passed since Poland as a state collapsed, however, Poland as an idea has never entirely perished. As the government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader] clearly shown, unification within a single generation wasn't a distant dream, but attainable reality. Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.196.a: "United at last."

unification.196.t: "[GetNewspaper]Żabka Unites Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.196.desc: "Poznań, once an economical, industrial and trade powerhouse, throwing shade upon the entire region, has fallen to infighting and destruction for years, after the fall of Poland and subsequent Eurocorps intervention. With a recent breakthrough in local power struggle, one faction has emerged as a local hegemon. As smoke clears over the capital of Greater Poland, it's the retail corporation of Żabka that dominated the capital of Western Poland. With the pre-war President overthrown and various gangs of Jeżyce and Rataje pacified, Poznań has become a true beacon of laissez-faire, all under the protective eye of the executive board in the grand glass skyscraper at Stanisław Matyja Street. Northern Greater Poland is now effectively corporate property of Żabka, with the corporation looking outwards for space to expand. Only future can show if their grand business ventures will be successful."
unification.196.a: "Ribbit."
