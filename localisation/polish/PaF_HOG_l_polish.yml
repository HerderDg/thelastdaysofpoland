unification.151.t: "[GetNewspaper]Paramilitarne bojówki Ad Arma jednoczą Kujawy!"
unification.151.desc: "Kuyavia has taken up arms. With the unexpected victory of a relatively minor paramilitary organization over all other warlords within the voivodeship's borders, both civilian and military governments alike, the region has found itself facing an uncertain future. While Jacek Hoga's statelet is undoubtedly reactionary in nature, harkening back to nationalistic sentiments and traditional values like any typical right-wing ideologue's creation, the core principle, the effects of which nearly all citizens have already begun to feel, as well as the most likely reason why Ad Arma's forces were able to punch far above their logistical and industrial weight, is the leader's near-fanatical insistence on arming every single one of his citizens, turning his realm into effectively a paramilitary with a state. Now, as a fresh batch of recruits trains to perform their duties once the Fatherland calls, the enemies of Poland tremble, knowing that the endless wave of combatants may soon crash into their territory."
unification.151.a: "Z 40 milionami żołnierzy może w końcu będą mieli szansę przeciwko Niemcom..."

super.151.t: "[GetNewspaper]Poland united under the flag of [FROM.GetName]!"

Against all odds, facing enemies on all sides, from within, aswell as forces from abroad, [FROM.GetName] stands truly united, having reforged the nation of Poland and it's diverse people into a monolith, proving that the confidence it's citizens layed upon the leadership and beliefs of their government wasn't at all misguided. Scars of the conflict will take time to heal, but with the unity forged in fires of war, future looks bright for Poland. As the sun rises above the land, citizens of [FROM.GetName] look forward with pride and high spirits, having passed the ultimate test of the Polish civil war."
super.151.a: "United at last."
