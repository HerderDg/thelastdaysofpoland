POLITICS_ROBERT_BIEDRON_DESC: "While the rest of Poland might reject him over and over again, Robert Biedroń can always count on the good people of Słupsk. \n\nBorn in a place exactly opposite to his political home - a small conservative town of Rymanów in the hills of Subcarpathia, Robert Biedroń has always found it tough to truly fit in. Taught from a young age about the deviancy and supposed sin of homosexuality, he initially found himself alone with his true feelings. Leaving his hometown for the wider world allowed the troubled young man to finally find people just like him, and he wasted no chance to join the fight for their acceptance. \n\nHaving found his new purpose in life, he decided to leave Rymanów to continue his studies. In the following years, Biedroń joined a number of pro-LGBT political organizations, finding time between his classes to attend the nation's first pride parade. \n\nNever leaving the public eye since that moment, even earning himself a brief stint as an MP, Biedroń finally managed to find his breakthrough into the mainstream in 2014. Seizing upon the chance of a lifetime, the young politician won the mayoral race in Słupsk despite no earlier connection to the city. Despite this, he quickly became beloved in the coastal town as if he had spent his entire life there. \n\nMoving on to national politics, however, was like continuously ramming his head against the wall. With no chance of ever winning more than a dozen percent of the vote, all Biedroń could hope for was being included in a coalition in case of centrist victory. But even that never came, with the leftist politician confined to eternal opposition. And perhaps no man in Poland was as disgusted with the actions of PiS as he. \n\nWhen the fall occurred, Biedroń rejoiced, returning to his adopted home of Słupsk. Seizing upon the instability within the Eurokommissariats he created a new state, one where for once people no longer have to hide their identity. \n\nThe people of Poland will finally experience freedom. If they don't want it by choice, then he'll ensure it by force."

unification.87.desc: "A new future has arrived for the people of Pomerelia, far from expected, given the recent turmoil. While the Eurokommissariats guaranteed their citizens basic safety, for some, they didn't go nearly far enough. The stronghold of liberalism shifts further to the left as Robert Biedroń reaches Gdańsk, intent to use it as his base to transform the region. In his first post-Fall public appearance in the city, he was greeted by thousands of LGBT youths eager to meet their perceived savior. A full legal emancipation of individuals of all orientations within the region soon followed, with any case of discrimination harshly punished. The state now turns to eliminate its growing pains, as remnants of right-wing factions don't seem particularly content with its rule, actively opposing it through a form of guerilla warfare. Regardless, the dream of Poland finally being a place accepting of all its citizens comes ever closer to reality."
