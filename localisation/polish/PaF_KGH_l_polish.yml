KGH_rebels: "Cicha rebelia"
KGH_burning_economy: "Gospodarka na krawędzi załamania"
KGH_burning_economy_desc: "Stan naszej gospodarki jest katastrofalny, a dla firmy takiej jak nasza gospodarka to wszystko! Obecnie nie stać nas nawet na regularne, stałe wypłaty ani na zapewnienie przyzwoitego, choćby minimalnego zabezpieczenia, czy finansowanie projektów rozwojowych. Dopóki nie przywrócimy zdolności produkcyjnych i nie wyprowadzimy budżetu na plus, możemy zapewnić naszym ludziom tylko najbardziej podstawowe środki do przetrwania. Jeśli nie podejmiemy szybkich i zdecydowanych działań przeciw recesji, sytuacja z biegiem czasu tylko się pogorszy. Gdy rezerwy się wyczerpią, możemy znaleźć się na krawędzi niewypłacalności - i wtedy nic już nie uratuje KGHM."
KGH_question_of_army: "Kwestia armii"
KGH_question_of_army_desc: "Nasza armia to żałosna mieszanina pracowników, którzy nigdy nie trzymali broni w ręku, kilku weteranów z okolicznych miast i jednego najemnego oddziału z byłego Eurokommissariatu Śląskiego. Różnią się przeszkoleniem, uzbrojeniem, a nawet językiem, co budzi wątpliwości co do ich zdolności do skutecznej współpracy w boju; jak dotąd ich wysiłki w utrzymaniu porządku w sennych miasteczkach i niesfornych wsiach były raczej... przeciętne. Cały system jest zepsuty i żadna ilość pieniędzy (której kombinantowi poważnie brakuje) tego nie naprawi. Jeśli nie zreformujemy armii, inni watażkowie chętnie wykorzystają naszą słabość."
KGH_company_friction: "Tarcia w firmie"
KGH_company_friction_desc: "Największym problemem KGHM nie są zagrożenia zewnętrzne, lecz konflikty we własnych murach. Może nie są one najbardziej widoczne z zewnątrz i na pierwszy rzut oka wydają się nieistotne, lecz przenikają do najgłębszych zakamarków kombinatu. Rozrywają go, tną przewody i zakłócają łączność - wszystko z powodu niezgody między licznymi frakcjami firmy. Rada, Departament Technologiczny i Robotnicy są nawzajem skłóceni, bezpośrednio sabotując pracę tych, którzy nie należą do ich klik. Wygląda na to, że zanim staniemy w obliczu zagrożeń zewnętrznych, firma może rozpaść się od środka. Jeszcze jeden cios i cała struktura może się zawalić."

THE_MGMT_DESC: "Upadek Polski mógł oznaczać także upadek KGHM. Kombinat stracił wszystkich inwestorów - zarówno zagranicznych, jak i krajowych. Większość giełd rozważała skreślenie go z list, a wszelkie wsparcie państwa ustało. Członkowie zarządu mieli jednak inny plan: zamiast zamykać działalność KGHM, postawili na utrzymanie stałego źródła dochodu - przede wszystkim dla swoich pracowników, bo cały plan firmy opierał się na ich lojalności i zaufaniu do władz. Zawarli więc umowę z EK: pracownicy KGHM będą otrzymywać solidne emerytury i będą chronieni przed zagrożeniami, a miedź będzie sprzedawana do Europy (głównie do Niemiec) po relatywnie niskich, niepodlegających negocjacjom cenach. Oczywiście, aby zapewnić współpracę UE, w radzie zasiedli niektórzy eurobiurokraci.\n\nSądząc po nowych miedzianych szyldach pojawiających się w regionie, plan przetrwania zadziałał lepiej niż oczekiwano - do tego stopnia, że zarząd zaczął postrzegać upadek Eurokommissariatu nie jako zagrożenie, lecz jako okazję do rozszerzenia wpływów. Teraz pracownicy KGHM dumnie pędzą do pracy w nowym, nietypowym dla ich fachu środowisku, wyposażeni w hełmy i karabiny z logo KGHM, obok wycofujących się żołnierzy EK, przekupionych, by służyć jako najemnicy chroniący Dolinę Miedzi. Dzięki pomocy Departamentu Technologicznego KGHM znów może się rozwijać i zagospodarowywać przynależne mu tereny, zdobywając lojalność i zaufanie tych, którzy znaleźli się pod jego zarządem.\n\nNiestety brak nowych klientów, problemy z pobliskimi watażkami i lokalną społecznością romską coraz bardziej niepokoją zarząd..."
THE_SCIENTIFIC_INSTITUTE_DESC: "The Technology Department was established early after the Fall, from the existing Polish scientists working in KGHM plants, as a response to current problems. Their immediate help was needed to modernize copper mining and smelting, to maintain the machinery, and above all to support by all means an acceptable level of workers satisfaction and their standard of living. Scientific achievements of the departament substantially helped the combine to get back on its feet and avoid bankruptcy... Without Tech Department, §tKGHM would fall like Poland did.§! \n\nNow, the new Scientific Institute transformed into a supervisory board is setting course for all the citizens of the combine. The board solves the problems of the state in the way of solving scientific problems. There is no shortage of disputes and proving mistakes, but in the event of an impasse, the final decision is made by the chief director.\nBased on statistics and complex calculations, the institute is able to make the best choice in everything from extraction, production, through the sales chain, to the safety and well-being of the company and the population."
THE_CORE_DESC: "Center of all of operations, where thoughts of all of the brightest flow freely without any biological or physical constraints. Founded by a genius who did not want all the glory for himself, he did the opposite - he merged his mind with all Polish minds, intentionally rejecting his objective self, leaving only his consciousness as a flash in this great creation.\n\nIf you could look at a Think Tank, it would look like a great metropolis of brains, stretched-out neural fibers, the circuits that bind and connect them all, energy-storing cells, and the squeaking and buzzing noises that accompany them, all covered in a glass cylinder set on a large circular metal base.\nThe brains and the biological parts are just vessels, the remnants of each's biological identity, but their presence of mind is in a different place. A single consciousness can move individually whenever and wherever it thinks, without the limitations imposed by nature on us.\n\nHowever, in the combined consciousness they are all together, gathered and attracted by the Great Copper Obelisk inside the tank. All important decisions regarding the security, expansion and future of the new form of existence are made here. - this is the center of The Core - Poland itself!"

CHLUDZINSKI_DESC: "§LThe CEO of the combine - a man devoted to utmost quality and respected across all levels of KGHM's corporate structure. It was he who steered the company through the perils of Eurokommissariat Schlesien's harsh occupation and hold the whole operation together when it once again threatened to collapse into dissolution. The Spiritus Movens, the only one who was able to restore general trust in the management, the bringer of stability and the force behind the combine's new wave of profit.\nThough dark times have fallen upon the Chairman, none can doubt his decisive leadership and ability to face the trouble ahead. His strong actions and soft words can shape the company's future, all he must do is keep a level head and navigate the ever-shifting political scene of the grand copper combine, even as hushed voices clamor for power behind his back.§!"
KSENBOK_DESC: "§LLoyal to the company from the beginning, few can match Andrzej Ksenbok's tenure and dedication to the combine. What he lacks in charm, he makes up tenfold with his perceptiveness and ability to seal nearly every deal, no matter how outrageous its stipulations may be. Briefly absent during EK Shlesien's occupation, jailed following a dispute with Schetyna's goons, the custody only served to strengthen Ksenbok's resolve, though it also forever changed him.\nThe job of selling copper and other rare minerals has never been harder than it now, with roads and railways rampant with bandits looking to steal them for an easy profit, but as warring statelets arm themselves for the conflicts ahead and clients look for any advantage over their competition, there is always a great opportunity to strike a favorable deal for KGHM's precious resources.§!"
BUGAJCZUK_DESC: "§LAdam Bugajczuk is one of the board's newest members, in fact, he wasn't even a part of the company before the Fall. Instead, he first served in the army and later in various private security agencies, sent out on missions to all corners of the world, no matter the danger. Following the withdrawal of the Eurokommissariat's forces, he returned to the war-torn country, intent on seizing the unique opportunity to sell his highly valuable and sought-after experience in training and managing military units to the highest bidder.\nFrom local volunteers and the shattered remnants of EK Schlesien's army, disillusioned with Schetyna's incompetent leadership, he formed the brunt of KGHM's defensive formations, needed more than ever to protect the company's territorial integrity.\nHis loyalty is unquestioned, especially as the majority of the armed forces are composed of employees dedicated to the Combine's advancement, yet no one can be fully sure if Bugajczuk can truly be trusted with the sheer amount of power he holds.§!"
SWIDER_DESC: "§LResponsible for the maintenance and expansion of mining operations, as well as transport of ores to furnaces and copperworks. As it is the Combine's primary task to constantly pump ever-increasing amounts of the white-hot blood into its copper heart, Świder's work ensures that KGHM stays true to its mission and the lives of thousands of workers and civilians can continue undisturbed.\nAs the board always pushes for increased output, only he remains to ensure the safety of dangerous underground and high-temperature work, even despite the post-Fall budget cuts, saving the OHS department from near-certain closure. For his efforts, is highly regarded among the lower cadres, viewed as a reliable man with a heart of gold.\nWith many years of experience at mining sites all throughout the world, having learned the trade everywhere from South America to Australia's famous opencast mines, Świder knows better than anyone just how to extract even the most challenging of ores.§!"

THE_DIRECTOR_DESC: "§LThe Main Director isn't a particularly charismatic leader, but rather a silent workhorse, with utmost dedication to both his projects and the company's wider goals. Though not exactly social, he does like to listen to the team, encouraging the atmosphere of constant brainstorming, and evaluates their tasks with a great deal of criticism but also accurate and helpful advice. Thus, he is regarded more as a mentor, than as the head of the company. However, his leadership abilities are not to be dismissed, as despite his quiet demeanor and mediocre charm, he is able to fight for his ideas like a lion and, at times, even act without the consent of his superiors.\nNow, he stands proudly as the backbone of the Technology department and the symbol of its reign. His professionalism, commitment, and authority have fostered a sense of hope among the rest of the Technological Board for KGHM's rejuvenation, even if the Director may often appear absent, somewhere very far away with his thoughts aimed towards something greater, yet unknown.§!"
THE_RIGHTHAND_SCIENTIST_DESC: "§LBorn in a small village somewhere in eastern Poland, the genius of KGHM's right-hand man was evident even from his earliest years. With grades far surpassing those of even his most talented classmates and victories in numerous nationwide contests, he was personally invited to pursue further education in the field of engineering by the Rector of one of the most prestigious universities in the country, where he specialized in heavy machinery and the usage of robotics in the metallurgical industry. Thanks to his groundbreaking solutions, he quickly climbed the ranks of the Technological Department, eventually ending up among the Institute's most trusted advisors. Perhaps his fascination with robots and automatization is, at times, too intense, but when the initial results are promising, all worries and precautions are swept aside by waves of frenzied progress. Though his chaotic style of work has been greenlit by the Main Director, it often clashes with the rest of the team and their meticulous approach to scientific procedures. \nIn a way, he is somewhat similar to his direct superior, and yet also his exact opposite. Both full of ideas and energy to implement them to the company's benefit, the work, and methodology of one, complementing those of the other. Together they are the main driving force behind KGHM's advancement.§!"
THE_DEP_ORGANISER_DESC: "§LThe Combine's main logistician, responsible for managing the flow of funds and resources between the various branches of KGHM's convoluted network of operations. She is held in high regard for her ability to keep the Director's focus straight, especially during his frequent moments of scientific trance, and ground him whenever he sets off with Walter to ponder some of his hellish ideas. Sometimes, even the arduous task of organizing KGHM's mountains of paperwork falls upon the tireless Doctor when the rest of the board disappears on yet another new venture. Still, her professionalism and perfectionism prevent her from following the path of her fellow scientists\nDespite everything, she enjoys her work deeply, reveling in the well-deserved appreciation flowing from the staff around her. Those who come in contact with Dr. Tenenbaum are stricken by her inner strength and discipline, but even more so by her ability to not lash out at her more... carefree colleagues.§!"
THE_MERCENARY_MANAGER_DESC: "§LA man on his own mission, always sure in his actions, even if they sometimes conflict with the will of the Board. At times he's the sole opposition in a room full of single-minded labcoats, rarely enough to change the course, yet clearly the odd one out among them. Yet, his role as the voice of the reason and representative of regular employees and the general populace cannot be understated, granting him considerable popularity outside the state's upper echelons. He often likes to sit in a factory bar, sketching in his notebook while downing countless shots of vodka and pints of cheap beer and talking to the common, dirty workers, listening to their long lists of issues intently. Unyielding in even the toughest fights and uphill battles, no challenge is insurmountable for Stanisław Braun when it comes to ensuring that the politically defenseless are well-fed and well-paid. Still, despite diverging interests, he remains on the team, deemed necessary by the Main Director as the last remaining guardian of the Combine's common sense, even if sometimes he has little will to pay his words any heed.§!"

THE_PROCESSOR_DESC: "§LThe main part of the Machine of Poland, the technological behemoth holding everything together, constructed by heavy-duty robots of all types and purposes and supervised by the last remaining biological engineers. The circular base is about 5 kilometers in diameter and the height of the structure surrounding the Tank measures in at over a hundred meters, fortified with concrete and automatic turrets. Thousands of kilometers of wires go through the Processor connecting all of our radars, maintenance stations, local defense systems and of course industry and laboratories. \n\nAs a giant computer, the Processor controls hundreds of drones and robots, maintains all crucial infrastructure and manages a near-incomprehensible number of structures and programs, but other than that, it serves as a virtual and of course physical barrier defending The Core from external threats.§!"
THE_CALCULATOR_DESC: "§LThe Machine of Poland is always working and therefore always counting. As the Processor is already preoccupied with general computing tasks, the researchers of the Board developed The Great Calculator. This part of combined machinery is focused on developing prognoses of production and extraction capabilities, worker drone management, ensuring optimal ore storage and preservation, consumption of energy resources and other arduous, yet necessary, logistical matters.\nIts large, cubical structure looms ominously over the misty grounds of the Central Lowlands. Never-ending, regular computing clicks are disturbed only by occasional maintenance drones and other harmless life forms, barely visible amidst the clouds of smoke rising through the web of ventilation shafts and cooling tubes of the Calculator.§!"
THE_GUARDIAN_DESC: "§LThe autonomous defense system responsible for ensuring Poland's, and more importantly, KGHM's safety. Its two primary goals are to protect The Core and secure all of the nation's rightful lands.\nThe Guardian of Electronic Military Modules also known in crisis situations as the§! §tGlobal Offensive Launch and Engagement Mechanism§! §L is a program controlling all assault robots, cyber peacekeeping forces, autonomous land vehicles, aviation, reconnaissance and combat drones, even missiles and high-risk armament.\n Additionally, the Guardian's task is to constantly search for rebellious elements, unwilling to cooperate and stuck to the myth of the superiority of biological life, and rejecting the merger into the power of eternal thought and singularity. Remotely guided catcher drones with infrared and sound sensors show optimal results for this task.§!"
THE_DIPLOMAT_DESC: "§LWhile projecting the future of Poland, the Technological Board has not forgotten about other countries, their obscurant people and ignorant leaders. Thus, The Diplomacy Algorithm was born - nicknamed The Diplomat. It is a system programmed to analyze all speeches, conversations, intentions, body language and actions of biological elements, based on up-to-date and improved psychological behavioral models and to subsequently make moves deemed statistically most advantageous for the Polish cause.\nThe margin of error is far below the threshold of significance and continues to decrease, because the neural self-learning program performing real-time analysis and its structure expands with each assimilated mind.\nWith its sheer computing power and knowledge of the human mind, the Diplomat can become quite a persuasive voice on the global stage.§!"

kghm.1.t: "Sytuacja Kombinatu"
kghm.1.desc: "Ahh can you smell it? Arsenic is in the air. Copper Mining and Smelting Combine - The red-brown pearl of the Polish economy, known in many corners of the world, providing jobs and stability to so many people, now in a state of near-death collapse clinging to everything to keep from falling apart completely.\n\nThe first blow came naturally, after the fall of the country. The quake caused damage to stocks, customers relationships, contracts, and even literal damage to employees and property.\nThe second was through the painful occupation, which allowed the combine to survive, but at the cost of inhumanly hard work and even slavery of thousands associated with the company.\nThe third... inexorably approaching. The Board, headed by main chairman, has somehow stabilized mining and production, but it is at a minimum level before stopping. A hastily summoned workers' militia and the remnants of EKS soldiers who stayed here for some time, encouraged by the remnants of assets, are guarding the boiling cauldron of the Copper Valley.\n\nWe hear voices about the upcoming rebellion of the Gypsy population, which has organized itself into a kind of combat camp. The three binders of this company - The Board, The Workers and our best specialists from Tech Department are increasingly unable to agree on how to act.\n\nThe company faces tough choices, but one thing is certain, if the lines stop, the copper heart will stop beating for good."

Doliny Miedzi, a po bohaterskiej obronie przed Obozami Romów szybko awansowała do grona najważniejszych graczy regionu.\n\nKGHM przetrwał Upadek Polski i w krótkim czasie umocnił swoją pozycję dzięki oddanym pracownikom przerobionym na żołnierzy, najemnikom pochodzącym z EKS oraz przede wszystkim potężnej maszynie gospodarczej zapewniającej masom mieszkania, żywność, energię, stałe zatrudnienie, opiekę zdrowotną, a nawet towary luksusowe z zagranicy. Konglomerat rządzi przez radę nadzorczą firmy, stosując całkowitą kontrolę nad gospodarką w celu utrzymania wzrostu - wykupuje istniejące przedsiębiorstwa na Dolnym Śląsku i finansowo zachęca zdolnych obywateli do pracy w oddziałach swojej megakorporacji."

Jednostki firmy zabezpieczają granice tej przemysłowej struktury, a działy księgowości na wszystkich szczeblach pilnie dbają o porządek prawny i fiskalny.\n\nNa początku teren zajęty przez kombinantów został rozdarty przez brutalne walki; z czasem pojawiło się coraz więcej przeciwników, aż do dziś, gdy niewielkie ognisko miedzi rozrosło się do znaczących rozmiarów w podzielonej Polsce. Rada robi wszystko, by pracownicy nie przerywali pracy ani na chwilę, a sprzedawcy nie przestawali zabiegać o klientów, bo bez tego kombinatu zabrakłoby funduszy na ekspansję. Pozornie niewielki dział technologiczny firmy urósł dzięki przełomowym wynalazkom - prace departamentu stale zwiększają możliwości przetwórstwa, logistykę i, co bardzo ważne, zdolności militarne KGHM, które wkrótce znów zostaną wystawione na próbę."

Pod zdecydowanym kierownictwem przyjęli trudną rolę zjednoczycieli. \"Teraz wielkość i dostatek są w naszym zasięgu\" - kontynuował rzecznik pewnym głosem. Tłum pracowników wyraził radość na widok zarządu na trybunach; dyrektor generalny i współpracownicy zostali obsypani burzliwymi oklaskami.
