unification.106.t: "[GetNewspaper]Polsat Plus Group unifies all of Radom Land!"
unification.106.desc: "Today, Polish families gather in front of the few still functioning TVs within the country, tuned in to the words of Zygmunt Solorz-Żak - the chairman of both Cyfrowy Polsat S.A. and the de facto statelet the company controls. The corporation's militias - initially serving only as security forces guarding company assets - managed to carve out a sizeable chunk of territory in the chaos of the Polish anarchy, eventually conquering all of Radomskie. Despite the ever-tightening grip on administration and law, as well as the suppression of independent enterprises, the state's inhabitants seem to be kept content with bread and (digital) circuses and promises of security, accepting their quotas and contracts binding them to the Group. As more and more Polsat Plus transmitters appear in neighboring lands, nearby warlords begin enforcing bans on Polsat-owned media, while the people of Łódzkie intensify their raids on the company's turf, furious at Solorz-Żak for his involvement in the SMR program."

unificationreg.106.t: "[GetNewspaper]Polsat Plus Group conquers Holy Cross Voivodeship!"
unificationreg.106.desc: "Grupa Polsat Plus continues branching out into the fields of administration and military as the corporate state the company's been building on Poland's ruins cements its rule and expands further up the Vistula, having just reached the southernmost parts of the Holy Cross Voivodeship. \nThe Group has provided a steady flow of televised entertainment and internet access to the population living under its rule, making itself more presentable to the newly conquered population that now has to deal with corporate life most of their time, not only at work. \n\nAs neighbouring cliques start completely blocking access to Polsat Plus television and phone connections, international observers start predicting how a Polsat-owned Poland will look like, and how long can a company hold that many people under direct rule before they finally get fed up with their new, shitty yellow ball logo."
unificationreg.106.a: "Stop bothering me, I'm watching Gra w ciemno and this poor dude just picked a -100% envelope." 

unificationsupreg.106.t: "[GetNewspaper]Polsat Plus Group expands into Central Poland!"
unificationsupreg.106.desc: "Grupa Polsat Plus continues its restructurization from a media empire to a literal one, having just conquered all of Łódzkie and parts of Upper Silesian voivodeships, and  - as both foreign and Polish observers repute - having started drawing up plans of complete conquest of all of Poland. \n\nWhile Solorz-Żak's ties to pre-Fall Polish gov's various undertakings have helped incorporate remains of the country's state apparatus into the Group, Polsat's *relatively* neutral stances on societal matters in politics have put to question whether Świat Według Kiepskich and Awantura o Kasę reruns will quench Poles' thirst for blood of their political oponents. \n\nThe Group's board, however, seems confident in themselves, and according to some leaks has already shifetd their media outlets' activity to prepare Poland for its soon-to-be chief executives' coming."

super.106.t: "[GetNewspaper]Sun Never Stops Broadcasting in Poland"
super.106.desc: "Zygmunt Solorz-Żak. In the past - the richest Pole in the world. Now - the richest and *the most powerful* Pole in the world. \nWhile some predicted to see him partaking in the creation of a new Polish state, no one - and especially not him himself - could predict that this new Poland would be literally *owned* by him and the company he founded, which despite providing television and phone services, was able to buy out armed security militias, secure its holdings in the country and then seize more turf, eventually becoming its own clique contesting other Polish warlords to reunify the country. \n\nAnd thus, the Polsat Plus Group became the owners of Poland. Or rather the ''Solar State'' - as their rule is referred to in reference to Polsat's previous sun logo. Like something straight from a cyberpunk movie - except we get to watch the setting evolve in real time."

super_a.106.t: "[GetNewspaper][FROM.GetName] jednoczy Polskę!"
super_a.106.desc: "Minęły lata od upadku państwa polskiego, lecz idea Polski nigdy nie zginęła całkowicie. Nasz lider, [FROM.GetLeader] wraz z rządem pokazali, że zjednoczenie w ciągu jednego pokolenia nie jest odległym marzeniem, lecz osiągalną rzeczywistością. Pomimo przeciwności, stojąc w obliczu wrogów zewsząd - wewnątrz i poza granicami - [FROM.GetName] stoi prawdziwie zjednoczone, przekształcając naród Polski i jego różnorodnych obywateli w monolit, dowodząc, że zaufanie, jakim obdarzyli przywództwo i idee rządu, nie było błędem. Blizny konfliktu potrzebują czasu, by się zabliźnić, ale jedność wykuta w ogniu wojny daje nadzieję na przyszłość. Gdy słońce wschodzi nad ziemią, [FROM.GetName] patrzy w przyszłość z dumą i podniesionymi głowami, przechodząc ostateczną próbę wojny domowej."
